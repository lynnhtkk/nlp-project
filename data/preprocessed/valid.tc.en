the same can be said about the European initiative .
to my mind , our involvement should be coordinated in a democracy centre , based in this House , mandated to act as a research unit , an oversight body on all the EU &apos;s pro @-@ democracy activities .
to take an example , the website of the State Department &apos;s Bureau for Democracy , Human Rights and Labor boasts that the United States has overseen the transition of 87 countries to democratic states .
is this a statistic that the EU wishes to leave in the hands of the United States alone ?
last weekend &apos;s G8 Conference in Rabat - and I am delighted that the Commissioner was present - co @-@ financed by the European Union , further developed plans for the Forum for the Future , first introduced at the Sea Island Summit in June 2004 , to promote democracy in the Middle East and North Africa .
despite the financial contribution of the European Union to such an important event , it is the Americans rather than the European Union who are leading this activity .
we recognise that the United States programme essentially echoes the principles of the Barcelona process and now the European Neighbourhood Policy .
in 2005 , the United Kingdom will take over the presidency of both the G8 and the European Union .
I sincerely hope that there will be a greater focus on the 250 million Arabs who want democracy , as illustrated by the 2002 United Nations Development Report , as well as the manifestly failing countries to our east .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human rights .
you will always be welcome .
Mr McMillan @-@ Scott has gone over this Regulation , a regulation that clearly demonstrates all our virtues - our many virtues - and also many of our problems .
it is a modest regulation in terms of its budget , but very ambitious in terms of its objectives ; we all agree on the need to approve it but , nevertheless , we have spent a year and a half - perhaps much more - dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue , which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation .
it has been a very complex process .
at the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this , by means of co @-@ decision , relating to third countries .
and now we are approaching the entry into force of the necessary extension , which begins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006 .
the Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valued by Parliament .
what we have reiterated now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood .
Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding , as the Commissioner has pointed out , for peace missions and missions of electoral observers .
furthermore , it would like the Commission to present , on an annual basis or at intervals it considers appropriate , an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project .
I suspect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co @-@ decision , with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report , has been modified unilaterally .
I hope that this will now be corrected , on the basis of the application of the Regulation , which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument , as this one is , for promoting democracy and human rights .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , promoting democracy and human rights in the world should be one of the priorities of the EU &apos;s external relations .
we feel empowered by our own , widely @-@ held understanding of the concept of the human race and of every human being , and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a freer world , a world that can be fairer , a world capable of building justice in freedom and , consequently , a more peaceful and safer world .
by firmly committing ourselves to the European initiative on democracy and human rights , we are promoting democracy , peace , the human race and security , all at the same time .
we must never lose sight of this , as we fine @-@ tune the instruments that we establish and as we administer the resources that we allocate directly to this action area .
after a number of years &quot; experience , I should like to make some observations .
firstly , Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field .
the amendments that have been proposed to the regulation will address this question sufficiently , provided , of course , the Commission accepts them in the right spirit and makes a broad and extensive interpretation of the new guidelines , thereby taking relations with Parliament to a more open and closer level .
this is what we are calling for .
it is also necessary , however , to express our opinion on other issues that concern us more .
firstly , are we going to dilute these instruments into more and more areas , more lines and more themes , or are we first going to set out a clear strategy , and then concentrate on a guideline that drives us forward and on fundamental priorities ?
I believe that the latter is the right way .
the concept of human rights is increasingly broad and also sometimes more vague .
there is also the temptation to use those instruments for anything and everything .
this to my mind would be the wrong way ; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of scant resources , or to the duplication of instruments .
there are many other instruments for policies on cooperation and development with third countries , but these instruments of the European initiative for democracy and human rights are highly political and should be focused primarily on promoting democracy and that fundamental nucleus of civic and political rights , freedom of conscience and religion , freedom of expression and debate , the separation of powers and the rule of law , freedom of organisation and activity of political parties and civil society , the opportunity to hold free and fair elections and the vitality of open and plural societies .
to conclude , we must also ask ourselves if we are going to take the path of increasing bureaucracy and officialdom in carrying out these policies , or will we be able to make those instruments more agile ?
this , more than anything , is what I ask of the Commission ; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most adventurous , most daring and most incisive lines of action .
bureaucracy and officialdom would lead to those instruments being totally unused for one simple and intuitive reason .
we cannot rely on dictators to encourage and promote democracy in their countries .
we must therefore be more agile and must know how to take our help to exactly where it is needed , exactly where it is lacking and exactly where it will make a difference .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to welcome the Commissioner on behalf of our group .
let me come straight to the point .
this evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years .
our group has no objection in principle .
during the recent months of dialogue with the Commission , however , we have placed some political conditions on our assent : that is to say , we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structured dialogue with Parliament .
it is not a question of our claiming management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliament &apos;s remit , but rather of claiming the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and , more generally , of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights .
we ask to be able to carry out an evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succeeded in advancing democracy in real terms .
in other words , Commissioner , this Parliament is asking to be involved in defining the guidelines for our actions and in judging the effectiveness of the results we obtain .
in recent years , many questions have remained unanswered and a great deal of information either has not arrived or has been supplied in a highly summarised form .
we do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme , which projects have been concluded , where they were carried out or with what concrete results - because in some countries the funds have been frozen - or indeed what is being done to unfreeze the funds .
we do not want to break the sacred rules of comitology , but it is a question of finding a for a relationship that is not just based on a verbal expression of good will .
Commissioner , we appreciate your offer of collaboration , and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpreted as an act of trust .
it is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regarded , as it often is , as a notary who is called in to formally approve the accounts but who has to confine himself to that alone .
that is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions .
in this regard , we believe that this programme should be streamlined and speeded up as much as possible .
greater responsibilities should be given to local non @-@ governmental organisations on the ground , and more emphasis should be placed on microprojects and on certain campaigns that in the past have made some headway in the difficult area of democracy in some countries .
we have to work a little harder on democracy , as we have neglected it up to now while focusing our operations on the area of human rights .
naturally , it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue , for which , Commissioner , Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote .
we hope , however , that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue - not just a formality but a dialogue of substance - to assess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , perhaps we should start with the very timely question posed quite rightly by Mr Fava regarding the dialogue between our institutions .
it is a recurring theme , which by the way makes this late sitting at this late season of the year worthwhile .
on this subject , Commissioner , we have heard you say and we have read - and you also said in your hearing - that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit , but which I in any case understood to be regular , relevant , open and prolonged , or , in short , structured .
this proposal , the offer of dialogue , is clearly one that Parliament will jump at , because , as you know , the Members of this House are eager to have the opportunity to engage in in @-@ depth discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about programming .
ladies and gentlemen , the ball is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal emanate from our ranks , from our committees and groups , in short from our Parliament , so that this dialogue can get underway very quickly , because it is urgently needed , with a group of Members who are well @-@ motivated and have some expertise on this issue , and there is no shortage of such people in this institution .
let us return to the initiative .
I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might undertake on democracy and human rights .
it has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our disposal to support , against the will of governments that are often autocratic or dictatorial , civil society , activists and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely complicated .
it is the only instrument that enables us to act in this way , and it is extremely precious .
in addition , I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perceived on the ground as being neutral , that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceived as doing so , contrary to the claims made when American agencies work on the ground , with such claims very often heard in Maghreb , in any case .
it is a very precious asset , made possible by the quality of the European Union &apos;s intervention .
of course there is still room for improvement .
one of the issues , and we all know of many examples , is that some NGOs cannot , for one reason or another , be supported under this initiative .
the governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic movements develop in their midst are not lacking in resources or imagination .
we have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply banned from receiving the grant by a political decree or by direct censure .
all of the decisions have been taken , but these NGOs are prevented from benefiting from the funds granted to them .
we have other examples of associations which quite simply do not legally exist .
in such cases we have to resort to subterfuge , and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ingenious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals .
I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007 .
and there , as other Members have rightly done , I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this precious asset , that we can always improve , is able to endure beyond 2006 .
that is what is at stake in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to welcome the Commissioner and I particularly appreciate the fact that she is a woman .
I fully agree with the need to extend the implementing arrangements relating to human rights , development and democracy .
I congratulate Mr McMillan @-@ Scott and I especially share the opinion of Mr Fernández Martín - in line with the vote I cast in committee - particularly on the amendment specifically calling on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the programming and to report back to Parliament on the implementation .
I have , however , in the words of Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner , seized upon the Commission &apos;s willingness to collaborate and also to hold a serious and in @-@ depth dialogue not only on the general guidelines but also on project execution .
I truly hope , amongst other things , that this dialogue will also take place directly with the Committee on Development , which I chair , since the issues of human rights , the empowerment of women and democracy are in fact closely linked to the question of development .
I should like to say to my very likeable fellow Member Mr McMillan @-@ Scott that I understand his frustration and I agree about this precious project , as Mrs Flautre put it .
in fact , parents cannot always bear to see their children grow up .
quite frankly , I would not want to emulate the United States , because their actions have very often led to the rise of dictatorships - I am thinking of the Pinochet regime , for example .
I believe the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East has already been repudiated by many in the Middle East because it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help .
I should therefore like us to retain our own individual character and also to value the important work that we are doing .
we do not actually want to export democracy , but we want democracy to grow and to have the ability to grow , and we can provide the tools for that purpose .
through visiting conflict zones and seeing the huge number of projects , I have realised that the ability to act without going through the authorities is fundamentally important .
the questions of torture , training and recovery , as well as the question of the empowerment of women have been extremely important .
I think we really need to continue along this path , but obviously in the knowledge that there are many limitations and many shortcomings , including in the area of finance .
I should not like us to confine ourselves to election observation missions , which very often cannot actually be taken very seriously if you consider that they only last one day .
I should really like us to continue operating along lines whereby our aid and our actions can truly be a tool for helping democracy to grow and not for imposing our values .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to say that Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner is the right person in the right place .
this cannot be said of all her colleagues , but that is no fault of hers .
the European Parliament &apos;s role is becoming ever more important within the EU institutions , and its authority is becoming ever greater amongst the public in the Member States .
after 25 years as a directly @-@ elected body , Parliament &apos;s importance is now at its height .
yet we should not derive satisfaction from the strengthening of Parliament &apos;s role as a result of battles of competence or procedure within the European Union .
to a greater extent than previously , the European Parliament &apos;s role must be to promote democracy in the world and to provide information on values and standards .
these values and standards ensure that , although our societies and political systems are not ideal , there are fewer wars and more dialogue on our continent , less violence and more compromise , and less institutional aggression and more international and institutional cooperation .
this is not a matter of promoting European values .
it is a matter of informing people about a style of politics based on a search for the common good and on widening participation in government at every level .
this is the role of both the European Union and the European Parliament today .
is EUR 100 million too much to spend on promoting democracy in the world ?
it is undoubtedly not enough , yet even a sum five times greater would still be much cheaper than going to the expense of repairing the effects of a lack of democracy .
it would cost a great deal more to provide assistance to the victims of civil and international wars that break out because politicians in many countries do not understand the meaning of democracy .
they only know it as a notion found in foreign language phrase books .
if more than EUR 100 million were to be granted , it would of course be necessary to monitor both our own institutions and the organisations receiving the funding .
in conclusion , I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr McMillan @-@ Scott , the rapporteur , for his work .
I hope the House will continue to work together on this issue , regardless of political divisions , and that it will work towards the goals referred to by Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner and the rapporteur .
Mr President , I join with others in welcoming the new Commissioner to this debate .
we look forward to working with her and , indeed , we look forward to the Commission &apos;s plans in 2005 and 2006 on this budget line , the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomorrow .
I support the fact that this is a budget line that reaches the grassroots and that civil society in the countries has a priority in receiving the monies .
I also support the fact that the Commission is planning to make conflict prevention a permanent priority for this budget line .
surely democracy is the best instrument of conflict prevention in our world .
I support what the Commission has done in terms of improving the contacts and support from its own delegations in third countries for projects under these lines , and also their plans to extend funding for micro @-@ projects , in particular for local NGOs in third countries who are most valued by us in this Parliament .
if I have a word of criticism , it is that every year the Commissioner &apos;s predecessor used to speak about human rights and then come in with a preliminary draft budget that cut this line - last year from EUR 127 million to EUR 105 million .
perhaps the Commissioner will choose not to do that in forthcoming years .
indeed , as Mrs Flautre has said , I hope that , whilst there are proper objectives for simplification of the budget , this particular line has symbolic importance and will be maintained in the medium and long term .
I also draw to her attention the increasing demands from international organisations , like the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court .
however , if these are to be funded from this budget line there must be a significant increase or NGOs will fail .
I oppose the attempt to reduce the priority given to projects worldwide under this budget line and refocus on near Europe .
that is a mistake : human rights are universal in our world .
finally , I express my respect for the rapporteur , Mr McMillan @-@ Scott , and his sincere interest in this budget line ; but I am pleased that he withdrew his amendments , which I believe represented micro @-@ management of this budget line .
the Commission &apos;s commitment to structured dialogue , as it put it , is one that we should welcome , and , with my colleagues on Parliament &apos;s Subcommittee on Human Rights , I very much look forward to engaging with the new Commissioner on that .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for this debate .
firstly , let me say to the Vice @-@ President , Mr McMillan @-@ Scott , that if he had not already invented this interesting procedure , we would have to invent it now .
I am absolutely convinced that it is a good thing , for I have always been highly committed to human rights .
in other words , you can count on the fact that you are dealing with someone who really believes in what they are doing .
let me say again that there will be genuine dialogue , not only at my level but also at working level .
I would like to reiterate this point unequivocally .
I do not agree that all we have done is observe elections .
I can cite a host of examples demonstrating that this is not the case .
we need only think of Ukraine , where a variety of projects is under way .
let me cite a few examples to show you that we really cannot view the situation in such narrow terms .
the Commission is already providing support here : for example , it has given EUR 300 000 to the European Centre for Common Ground , EUR 334 000 to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights : improving the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine through Legal Aid Provided by NGOs , EUR 787 000 to the European Roma Rights Center : defending the rights of Roma in Ukraine , EUR 685 000 to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group , and so on .
these are just a few of the projects .
let me turn to another region of the world which is very important to you and , indeed , to me , namely the Southern Mediterranean , the Arab region , although this does not only include the Arab countries , it also includes Israel , of course .
one example is the project entitled Palestine : Democratization from the Grassroots , Media and Networking as a Tool for Community Development , which is important in that it focuses primarily on civil society .
let me reiterate : I am particularly pleased - and I think this is a fortunate coincidence - that I was able to present seven action plans recently to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Monday .
the Commission and the Council have adopted the proposals and everyone spoke about them in very positive terms .
why ?
because these action plans will enable us to bring our values , namely human rights and everything with which they are associated - namely the rule of law , human rights and democracy - to these countries , such as Ukraine , as soon as free and fair elections have taken place there .
after that , the implementation begins .
however , they also focus on a poor yet important country like the Republic of Moldova , where we also need to take action .
Belarus is a separate case which I will come back to in a moment .
then , of course , there are the major countries in the Middle East which are ready for this process , notably Jordan , Morocco , Tunisia , Palestine and Israel .
the presentation of these seven action plans at this time offers a really good opportunity , in my view , to work together with and on these countries .
naturally , the action plans also offer opportunities for us to present our priorities alongside the countries &apos; own priorities and promote democracy and human rights .
I would like to outline some of the campaigns which we are carrying out within our human rights programme .
I admit that they do not amount to a massive sum , but it is still considerable , and I believe that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail .
campaign 1 is entitled &apos; Promotion , justice and dignity &apos; .
this targets criminal justice , supports universal abolition of the death penalty , and supports the work of international mechanisms which monitor and report on respect for human rights and related international treaty obligations .
campaign 2 , which is especially dear to me , is entitled &apos; Fostering a culture of human rights &apos; : human rights education , training , monitoring and awareness @-@ raising by targeting advancement of rights of marginalised or vulnerable groups - that means the rights of women and children - including female genital mutilation , trafficking of women , human rights defenders ; torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims , programmes of higher education and training for professionals , support for human rights dialogues .
so , on the whole , it is a very important campaign .
campaign 3 is entitled &apos; Promoting democratic process &apos; .
this is essential for all these societies , especially for the Middle East or the broader Middle East , which I will come to later .
so there is a lot of development of participatory democracy , fostering informed pluralistic discourse with civil society , targeting freedom of association , freedom of expression , independent press , broadcasting , unimpeded access to the Internet , and election observation missions .
campaign 4 is entitled &apos; Advancing equality , tolerance and peace &apos; , embraces the issues of racial discrimination , xenophobia , rights of minorities , indigenous peoples .
then there is the selection of regions and countries and matching them with each of the four campaigns .
all that is foreseen for 2007 , and in the next financial perspective there will be only six finance regulations , four of which are very important ones : enlargement , development , good neighbourhood policy and stability .
in all of them , democracy and human rights are in the mainstream , which is a real achievement on the basis of which we can work .
there is thematic programming here .
returning to Belarus , which we spoke about in the Council recently , I explained that I wanted to work specifically with the NGOs .
we then received an invitation from Lithuania to hold a workshop there .
so we will have three phases : firstly , two phases in the Commission , and then we will confer with Parliament .
then there is also an invitation from Lithuania , because Lithuania , Poland and many of these countries know where we have to start with NGOs .
you are right : we can only work with civil society there , because we cannot work with governments at this stage .
on the broader Middle East , I was very interested in this new possibility for cooperation .
it is true that we have been working for ten years with the countries of the Middle East , the southern basin of the Mediterranean .
the United States is now doing something similar .
it is a good initiative , because the more we can work in parallel and thus bring more democracy and easier access to democracy to the region , the better .
I now turn to some other more formal questions .
according to the information I have , for reasons of juridical coherence , the Council has now reintroduced the amendments tabled by Parliament when Regulations ( EC ) Nos 975 / 1999 and 976 / 1999 were at the drafting stage .
I hope this information is welcome to the Members who raised this .
in order to work better with NGOs it was essential to have deconcentration , as we call it .
that means that we have given a lot of responsibility to the delegations , that are also in a much better position to conduct a survey on what NGOs are doing .
this is also why we will follow developments much better .
I hope that there will be better control because I know that while , on the one hand , we should have a speedy means of action , on the other hand we also have to be very careful and to control things properly .
this is what I wanted to say .
indeed , it is an offer of dialogue on my part .
I thank you for taking it .
we are not perfect , but there is a positive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this positive spirit to work together for the major values of our European Union - that is , human rights .
. Mr President , as the Commissioner will find , the European Parliament always has the last word .
I am pleased that the Commission is beginning to examine the possibility of doing some work in Belarus .
I mentioned Belarus , and also Tunisia and Iran : two other countries where nothing is happening .
I am grateful for the good will and the commitment of the Commissioner in her new post , and we welcome her into it .
I also welcome her commitment to establish some working @-@ level cooperation between Parliament and the Commission .
I advise the Commission that this week the European Parliament , through the good offices of the Human Rights Subcommittee , is commissioning a study by independent experts into the operation of this programme .
it is something I asked for last year from the Commission , but it was unwilling to give it .
this will be completed by February .
may I make one final remark , since I know the Commissioner was in Rabat at the weekend and we are dealing with a vast and important agenda : the process of reform in the Middle East .
when I began working on this report , the funds available from the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights to the entire Middle East were four per cent of the total .
given the circumstances of the last three years , that was an extraordinarily low figure .
I am pleased the Commission is now adjusting that , and we need to refocus the programme .
notwithstanding what Mr Howitt said , we have strategic objectives and strategic priorities .
I am pleased to see the Commission is now beginning to focus on those .
I thank the Commissioner for her words and for her commitment , and we look forward to working together constructively and practically , but on the basis of equal interest in the development of democracy , particularly in our neighbourhood .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
the next item is the debate on the report by Mr Papadimoulis on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999 / 847 / EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
. Mr President , I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission &apos;s proposal for the extension of the Community action programme on civil protection for the years 2005 and 2006 .
I very much appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report , in particular the work of Mr Papadimoulis , the rapporteur .
before I go into detail on this report , I think it is worth recalling the work done under the auspices of this action plan since its adoption in December 1999 .
the objectives of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensure better protection for people , the environment and property in the event of natural or technological disasters across the Community .
the action programme has funded a range of useful projects , exchanges of experts and workshops that build invaluable cooperation and also mutual assistance between the Member States &apos; civil protection services .
the action programme supports and supplements efforts at national , regional and local levels .
emphasis has been put on major projects concerning prevention , information of the public , crisis management , disaster medicine and networking among the different volunteer associations active on the ground .
in recent years we have seen major disasters .
you will recall the floods in central and eastern Europe in the summer of 2002 , the oil spill , also in the same year , the unprecedented heatwave and devastating forest fires in southern Europe in the summer of 2003 .
this year we were shocked by the violent terrorist attack in Madrid and saddened by the earthquakes in Iran and Morocco .
these events clearly illustrated the need for further action to strengthen prevention and preparedness measures and also to enhance our ability to respond rapidly and in solidarity as a European Union .
the Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection .
the rapporteur has rightly highlighted some issues in the report , and these are both valuable and constructive remarks that we will take into account in our future work .
I would like to react immediately to a number of points .
the report recommends &apos; better sharing of information on available resources , expertise and successful strategies and practices at national level &apos; .
the Commission agrees that our database of resources should be further upgraded and contain more data on responsive capacities , associated costs and available equipment .
the Commission is currently working with Member States on these issues .
the report argues for an improved operational framework for volunteers and for the establishment of guidelines for their work .
this is a helpful suggestion and echoes the emphasis that the Commission is now putting on the work on this subject , which was and will remain a priority for financing in 2005 .
let me turn to the issue of financing assistance during emergencies .
this is an issue of concern to us , but depends on having a sufficient level of funding available .
for the time being the budgetary resources available only permit financing of experts who travel to the scene of disasters to assess needs for assistance .
additional financing depends at present on the donating and receiving Member States .
I should like to add that there is also , as you know , the possibility to use the EU Solidarity Fund to provide compensation to a country suffering severe damage from a disaster .
finally , the report asks the Commission to provide a report on the programme in 2006 .
we have no difficulty in accepting this request .
with these remarks , I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thoughtful and constructive opinion .
may I add that my colleague , Commissioner Dimas , sends his apologies for not being here .
he is in Buenos Aires and asked me to replace him .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on this report comes , as the Commissioner noted , after a series of major natural disasters in recent years which raise the question of the need to strengthen the Community action programme : floods , heat @-@ waves , forest fires , earthquakes , serious pollution incidents from toxic waste or oil spills , such as that from the , as well as serious industrial accidents and also terrorist attacks .
my country , Greece , is currently experiencing immense anxiety as the result of the hijacking of a bus with several hostages whose lives are in danger .
these dangers and these disasters have many victims and cause ever greater economic losses ; they disrupt the economies of the countries affected , hitting in particular the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the population .
that is precisely why action also needs to be taken by governments , preventive measures need to be strengthened and response capacities need to be extended .
the Community response to this problem is the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
this programme expires in a few days , on 31 December 2004 , and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared , in order to avoid a gap until such time as the new programme is prepared .
that is why I support the Commission proposal to prolong this programme for the next two years , just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annually , which was the amount in 2004 , to EUR 2.4 million annually for the next two years .
you may say it is not a big increase .
I agree , but it is absolutely essential in order to finance increased needs due to enlargement and to finance the action programme to combat marine pollution which has been decided in the meantime .
unfortunately , it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perception as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission , and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation .
otherwise , we shall not be consistent in our obligations towards the citizens and it is precisely at times of natural disasters that those who voted for us and sent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by their side .
this programme therefore needs to proceed and , at the same time , certain points in it need to be improved on the basis of experience obtained to date .
in studying the problem , I have identified seven sectors in which improvements are needed in practice , because on paper the system looks good , but on the ground experience to date has shown that it has serious shortcomings .
one , better sharing of information on available resources , expertise and successful strategies at national level .
the database , its data and the capacity for fast communication and coordination need to be improved , in other words the computer database needs to be upgraded .
two , more training for intervention teams .
experience has shown that more regular training is needed for better cooperation and interoperability .
three , better communication , coordination , in @-@ time information systems for the prompt information of the public and links with other networks .
four , funding : not simply increasing funding but safeguarding speedier response with the release of the source of funding and concentrating all the appropriations needed under one heading .
five , strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities .
increasing the number of volunteers .
six , empowerment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disasters .
and seven , implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and reinforcement of the drawing up of national plans for emergency coordination , a sector in which numerous Member States have serious shortcomings .
for the reasons which I have described to you and so as not to be too longwinded , because it is already quite late , I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the greatest possible support , as did the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , which approved my report almost unanimously .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with Mr Papadimoulis &apos;s report regarding the absolute necessity of extending the Community action programme for the two @-@ year period of 2005 @-@ 2006 in order to facilitate cooperation , especially cross @-@ border cooperation , on the exchange of expertise and mutual assistance among Member States in this field .
cross @-@ border cooperation and a cooperation culture are fundamental , because the security of the countries in the European Union is closely linked to what happens on their borders .
to that end , we must invest heavily in volunteers .
in addition , we agree on the seven areas that need to be strengthened , in view of the deficiencies revealed at the level of individual nations .
the European People &apos;s Party also believes that the Commission ought to evaluate the implementation of the current programme before it ends and prepare a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council .
I would point out that the Community action programme is being extended to the years 2005 @-@ 2006 without Parliament having been sent the mid @-@ term report or the final report provided for by Decision 1999 / 847 / EC establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 .
to date we have not even received any justification for the delay .
that is a very serious failing , because it violates Parliament &apos;s prerogative to give its opinion and forces it come to a decision without seeing any qualitative or quantitative information on the actions taken or the results achieved .
our confidence in the new Commission , however , leads us to hope that these reports will be forwarded by the requested date of 30 June 2006 , precisely for the purpose - and in the hope - of promoting full cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission .
those documents should give us an evaluation of the extent of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection , together with the actions planned under the other two ongoing Community programmes , which will provide Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment with useful suggestions for inclusion in the single action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , happily we all agree on this issue and , consequently , I also share what has been said by previous speakers .
we feel that it is crucial to extend this action programme and we also deem it important that in the two years concerned , 2005 and 2006 , the Commission can make an accurate assessment of the current programme and can prepare a new and more ambitious instrument of action , taking account of the Financial Perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 and any needs identified in the meantime .
new problems require new solutions .
we also , therefore , endorse Mr Papadimoulis &apos;s report - and I compliment him on his work - and we naturally support the Commission &apos;s proposal to extend the programme .
we do feel , however , that , bearing in mind the programme &apos;s objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries , funding should be stepped up even further .
the importance of civil protection continues to grow .
persons and property must be protected and this is an area that requires greater resources .
in recent years , as has been pointed out in this House , a number of natural disasters and criminally @-@ motivated disasters have occurred , which have affected both the people and the economies of the countries concerned .
such was the case of the accident , the floods in the South of France , the terrorist attack on Madrid and the forest fires in Spain and Portugal .
coming from Portugal as I do , I am particularly sensitive to this issue , as you will understand .
as I have said , greater funding would be desirable so that we can better prevent and remedy situations of this nature .
in Portugal alone , for example , in 2003 , 400.000 hectares of forest were burnt and approximately 170.000 hectares in 2004 .
it is therefore essential that the next action instrument provides for greater financial support .
the environment is priceless and our forests cannot continue to disappear .
we have an obligation to preserve them so that we can leave them to future generations .
we cannot forget that the Earth does not belong to us , it has been borrowed for our children .
we must therefore step up measures aimed at prevention and cure .
as far as prevention is concerned , there must be greater EU involvement , in conjunction with national , regional and local administrations , along with technical and financial support , to prevent these disasters , which occur year after year .
prevention is better , and indeed more effective and cheaper , than cure .
with regard to restorative measures , coordination and monitoring must be stepped up , particularly in terms of reforesting the areas affected by the fires .
it is worth remembering that the restoration of the Mediterranean forest has taken almost a hundred years .
there are sectors in which we cannot make savings .
as for civil protection , making savings might mean becoming irredeemably poorer and our collective future being severely compromised .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall say straight away that I am in favour of extending the Community action programme on civil protection by two years .
to me it seems not so much a free choice as a mandatory solution , without any alternatives .
we have reached the end of the current programme without a lasting , concrete solution to the problem .
that very fact shows just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is .
I feel I have developed some modest experience in this field , as I chair the civil protection committee in Catania , the province of Italy most exposed to seismic and volcanic risk , and also because I coordinated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terrible eruption of Mount Etna in the summer of 2001 .
over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agreeable topic for a round table or a pleasant , convivial get @-@ together , but is a subject that is indissolubly linked to people &apos;s safety and , as you know , safety is a physiological right before it is a constitutional right .
I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and scandalously dragging its feet in this area .
the subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in theory but in practice suffer from serious deficiencies - as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself , whose work I admire .
in fact , the approach seems schizophrenic not only at a logistical level but also because of the inadequate financial cover .
Commissioner , what results have the information monitoring centre , the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk forecasting and prevention , rather than of emergency and post @-@ emergency management ?
what qualitative results have they had on European Union territory ?
can we find out what their effect has been ?
can we have a detailed report ?
will people understand that a disaster may not always coincide with the borders of an individual state , thus becoming a supranational problem , as the oil slick from the demonstrated ?
how can civil protection capabilities in Europe be allowed to remain fragmented among the areas of responsibility of the environment , health , territory , agriculture and internal affairs ?
a European civil protection agency needs to be set up , something I asked the Commission to do two years ago .
apart from the fact that an operational structure can undoubtedly increase involvement , especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem , such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territorial level to develop and harmonise procedures and methods for analysing and mitigating the risk of natural and technological disasters , and it would establish a proper task force .
in conclusion , I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volunteers and to support it with structured training , equipment and funds , so that it can become an essential resource for dealing with emergencies and natural and other disasters .
I hope that the Commission will find the strength , the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his clear and specific comments on the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
his proposals on integrated management and more efficient operation of the relevant mechanism and the extension of the programme , which we support , are also to the point .
over recent years , all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienced disasters with the broadest , direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole .
in response to these events , we adopted the Community action programme .
as we all recall , we were overtaken by events and reacted after them .
let us take proper stock today , quantitatively and qualitatively , and let us look with the experience we have acquired at how we can improve the existing mechanism in all its functions and at all stages , from prevention to combating of disasters and the restoration of and return to social life .
this relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Solidarity Fund .
the rapporteur proposes better exchange of information and best practices , more training for intervention teams , mobilising volunteers and better coordination between the agencies involved at European , national , regional and local level .
as far as increasing the budget is concerned , it is necessary but , at the same time , the procedure also needs to be simplified .
I trust that the issue we are debating tonight will receive the assent of the Council , because it is a very important issue .
it not only resolves daily problems , but is also of major symbolic importance .
the citizens feel the European Union in their lives with this sort of intervention .
European nationality thus acquires a specific and deeper meaning .
this sort of programme brings European institutions , national and local agencies and local authorities into direct cooperation , something in which we are lagging behind , both at national level and in terms of coordination between the European Union and the national agencies .
to the outside world , this sort of programme gives the European Union visibility and , more importantly , projects an efficient and humane face , something which , listening to you on the previous report Commissioner , you intend to make a reality .
Mr President , I wish first of all to welcome the proposal by the rapporteur , Mr Papadimoulis , to extend the action programme in the field of civil protection .
coming from a country which has benefited in the past from EU funding in order to cope with natural disasters , I fully appreciate the importance of the programme .
indeed , as a former minister in my own government , I visited Brussels in 1995 seeking assistance to alleviate the effects of substantial flooding throughout the length and breadth of Ireland .
I succeeded in obtaining considerable financial assistance .
I note the increase in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 2005 and 2006 but , like other speakers who have contributed to this debate , when I examine the increase I note that it is a mere EUR 0.9 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006 .
I read the report in some detail and the justification for the increase is &apos; EU enlargement &apos; .
when one considers the fact that we are increasing the size of our Community and welcoming the accession of 10 new Member States to our Community , in real terms the so @-@ called increase is actually a decrease ; that is without factoring in inflation .
I would like to see an emergency fund - I know you mentioned the Solidarity Fund - for civil disasters , where direct aid would be given to the regions of the new accession states , in the same way as Ireland was helped in the past .
these states have freed themselves from the iron grip of Moscow .
they all qualify for Objective 1 status ; their economies are still largely embryonic .
just as Ireland found itself in civil disasters , these new countries will inevitably find themselves in situations where natural disasters will occur .
I fundamentally believe that we should set aside each year a substantial fund to assist such countries by way of direct relief aid .
I commend the rapporteur for his systematic approach and recommendations .
he went through each area in detail .
prevention , where possible , is desirable ; preparedness is vital ; protection , emergency measures and recovery are all essential .
I believe the scheme that he has prepared is excellent , but it is totally underfunded .
we cannot foresee earthquakes , floods or forest fires - they are natural disasters .
in conclusion ,
I am not speaking Swahili , it is my own native tongue , Irish , which unfortunately is the only official language not included in the Community .
a happy Christmas and a happy New Year to each and every one of you .
. Mr President , I have listened very carefully to what has been said .
first I wish to thank you all - the rapporteur and all the Members of Parliament who have spoken - for your support for this programme for civil protection , which we all feel is important .
I also thank you for your cooperation .
in answer to the question about how will this go forward , I can tell you that there will be no problem , there will be a prolongation .
Coreper discussed the Commission proposal on 15 December , and it will go as an &apos; A &apos; point - that is , one where there are no problems - to the Environment Council before Christmas .
let me also say that , in the meantime , the Commission intends to present a proposal for a new legal instrument with a view to its entry into force in January 2007 .
that means that this new proposal will be based on the provisions of the new constitutional Treaty for greater possibilities to develop European cooperation in the field of civil protection ; and thus we will be working particularly in the field of prevention that you all mentioned , but also in the field of response .
the next two years will be a transitional period to prepare in the best possible way the venue for the new Treaty , which will include many of the items and elements mentioned here .
you all spoke about prevention and nearly all of you mentioned the importance of contributions of volunteers and also of social partnership and the question of financing , which depends on the financial regulations .
again , we are ready to make the preparations , and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal .
I hope that my colleague Commissioner Dimas will then be able to discuss this very closely with you .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
the next item is the Commission statement on the transport of animals .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressing my gratitude for the opportunity which I have today to convey to you the Commission &apos;s views on such an important and emotional issue .
I understand and share the concerns and interest of the European Parliament on such an important issue .
allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is , not only to the European Parliament , not only to the European Commission , but also to our millions of citizens and , of course , to farmers and to all the agencies involved .
I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed , transported and slaughtered .
the need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day @-@ to @-@ day reality and not just on the statute book is an important objective for me .
I have long been aware of the unsatisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the apparent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities .
the correct and full enforcement of animal welfare legislation is essential , as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport .
this is why the Commission , despite its desire to do more to restrict transport @-@ by @-@ road times and reduce stock intensity on vehicles , accepts the presidency &apos;s step @-@ by @-@ step initiative in the Council .
we felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our grasp , rather than to defer the whole dossier to a later indefinite date .
this , as I will point out later , is without prejudice - and I would like to emphasise this - to any improved future solution .
in doing this , we have opted for much stricter rules , significantly improving current conditions , to be applied as soon as possible .
they will cover matters such as long @-@ distance transport or new , substantially upgraded standards for vehicles .
these will be enforced in the shortest possible time within EU standards .
I wish to point out that the vast majority of Parliament &apos;s amendments have been integrated and incorporated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution .
I have no problem in admitting that it is unfortunate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport density .
there was no chance - and I have to be frank about this - of such provisions being supported in the Council , and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricultural Council was a clear warning .
but failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an indefinite continuation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement .
this does not mean , however , that the Commission does not believe that all possibilities for reinforcing the provisions on travel time should and will be exploited in the future .
firstly - and this is not the only possibility - the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within - not after - four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and loading densities and possibly to modify its approach on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules .
however , in addition - and this is important - regardless of what the regulation provides , the Commission will carefully analyse the situation , including the prevailing political conditions , and will avail itself of its power of initiative .
I retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise .
let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the near future .
I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all .
before I do so , I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stricter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation .
therefore , this is a challenge for the Member States , and it is a challenge for you .
if enough Member States adopt stricter rules then the political pressure - the peer pressure - on the rest would be much more evident and effective .
however , we need the improvements in the existing regulation .
firstly , a satellite navigation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007 .
there will be forced ventilation and temperature monitoring inside the trucks , with improvements in water facilities and drinking facilities , individual stalls for the transport of horses and other conditions in relation to horses .
there will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant , sick and wounded animals .
there will also be administrative provisions to ensure consistency between checks by officials in different Member States .
this will apply to all journeys .
as you will be aware , the use of satellite navigation systems was promoted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission .
this represents an innovative and promising tool to monitor animal transport , and the Commission is ready to invest immediately in this .
the proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high @-@ quality approach to animal transport in Europe , in tune with the wishes of our citizens but also enabling better enforcement .
this is extremely important .
it is not enough to regulate or adopt rules , we must have the means to enforce them and to supervise their enforcement .
European citizens have pointed out on innumerable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreciable weakness of the current system .
I fully agree with that .
I am determined and committed to ensuring better enforcement of animal welfare rules and to insisting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out .
we will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way .
to sum up , we stated in the Council that the Commission reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty , with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals .
therefore , the Commission will continue to be vigilant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States .
we are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement .
I would like to comment on two more issues .
first , the improvement of animal welfare is a continuous process .
it is not just a regulation , we are already working on other improvements on poultry and on microclimates within the transport vehicles .
therefore it is not the end , it is just the beginning .
at the same time , I have looked at what the options were at the last Council meeting .
they were not between the optimum maximum and the compromise , they were between the compromise and continuing indefinitely with the present situation , with all the unacceptable conditions that prevail at this point .
I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision , one has to weigh the pros and cons and decide in which direction to go .
I can assure you that the Commission &apos;s only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible .
it was not just to insist on a principle which eventually would harm the animals , because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way .
I repeat , the present compromise significantly improves the present situation without depriving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues .
believe me , it was a Commission proposal .
we would have been much happier if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise .
but , unfortunately , there was no possibility of such an agreement .
if I may , I suggest talking to the various NGOs .
they were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realised that it is a significant step forward .
finally - and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter - I can assure you that my intention is , before the end of this Commission &apos;s term and definitely before the end of this Parliament &apos;s term , to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion .
the Commission is committed to this .
but , the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes .
. - Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Kyprianou most warmly for the openness with which he has raised this issue once more .
you have only just assumed your duties , and I think that your position at all events opens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this , too .
I am saying this with good reason : you hit the nail on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities .
this is our sticking point , and remedying it would represent tremendous progress .
I should like to give an example by way of illustration .
I note that , at the present time , the Austrian government , in particular , is doing a good job and is exercising good supervision .
this is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden .
this is the kind of situation that arises when a number of other Member States neglect their duties .
in that regard , the Austrian model should become the European model : with effective legislation and effective enforcement .
this is the way to put an end to all the unpleasant debate .
however , the Council has come to an agreement , and has made a corresponding amendment without giving prior notice to Parliament , which I find very disconcerting and also blameworthy on the part of the Council .
on the other hand , I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative , because we cannot deny that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation .
you know Parliament &apos;s line of thinking .
I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum journey time for stock for slaughter .
this has now proved unattainable in the Council .
nevertheless , I note that the introduction of the satellite tracking system has become a reality , at all events , and that enforcement of the existing rules is to be improved .
in that regard , I should like to hear how the Commission intends to enforce this at Member State level .
are other instruments necessary in this regard , including on the part of Parliament ?
I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training .
finally , I note that farm @-@ to @-@ farm transport has been liberalised .
we should have liked to see 100 kilometres , but this was evidently unattainable in the Council .
nevertheless , we have taken a small step forward .
I should like to mention two other points .
first of all , there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of breeding stock and the rest periods stated for this .
animals must be transported as quickly as possible , and introducing the minimum possible number of rest periods for the transit of breeding stock , too - which is undertaken in the main in very favourable conditions - would be a step forward .
this means that animals can also be transported over medium distances .
the same goes for the roll @-@ on / roll @-@ off system on ferries .
telling Member States in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help .
all this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport .
as a former rapporteur , I am a little disappointed that no maximum journey times for stock for slaughter have been agreed .
nevertheless , I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward .
I am extremely curious to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 2009 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament , and also , in particular , for making Member States comply with the European rules .
. - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his words . I share his disappointment over the Council &apos;s compromise .
it brings no improvement in the journey times for animal transport , none in the rest periods and none in the maximum stocking density , and that could endure for years to come .
I wish the Council every success in attempting to explain this compromise to the European public .
it is an extremely bad one , including for the image of the whole sector , and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view .
I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum journey time to eight hours .
only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture , one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare .
Europe is built in small steps , as we all know , and indeed that is a very good thing , in many cases even the best way .
whilst the EU is taking excessively small steps here towards improving animal welfare , animals in Europe are being dragged back and forth for thousands of kilometres in atrocious conditions .
it will be nice and reassuring for them to know that they are being watched by satellites all along .
.
Mr President , I agree with the Commissioner &apos;s statement .
this is a very important issue .
I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed , transported and slaughtered .
as the Commissioner stated , the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation .
some of them have been mentioned already : proposals for satellite tracking systems , ventilation and temperature monitoring , stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries .
progress has been made .
I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban .
agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland .
indeed , the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU .
live animal exports are a hugely important , legitimate business for Ireland .
we export 90 % of our animals and about 10 % of those , or 200 000 live cattle , are exported every year to markets in France , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands .
this trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually .
therefore , a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector .
I believe we must have access to the single market .
there is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered .
surely , free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy .
we also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture , not just in Ireland , but also in the EU as a whole .
again , I agree with the Commissioner .
we need enforcement and no one has a problem with that - consumers or farmers , it is in all our interests .
another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland .
this is another cornerstone of EU policy .
I believe we have made progress ; there is probably further to go , but the Commission is doing useful work .
Mr President , I took the initiative regarding this extra debate following the Council decision in November .
a number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years &quot; blocking of the issue of protecting our animals .
this would mean that , throughout their periods of office , neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals , a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable .
the Council decision departed so completely from the proposal that I even doubted its legality .
Mr Kyprianou , I hope you realise your ambition of coming back with density figures and transport times as soon as possible .
I also hope that you make use of the Treaty &apos;s articles concerning transport , consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure .
we could then together break the Council &apos;s resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions .
unfortunately , the Council listens more to lobbyists than to opinion .
the maturity of a society is shown by the way in which it treats those who are defenceless .
if the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europe &apos;s maturity , we are unfortunately still barbarians .
I invite all ministers to travel , together with myself , between Stockholm and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals .
they might then understand what they have done .
if we are regarded as 75 @-@ kilo sheep , there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed .
if we are regarded as chickens , we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below .
if we are regarded as pigs , we shall , in accordance with the Council decision , be given nothing less than electric shocks if we refuse to move .
we shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours .
we must also try to ensure that , in accordance with the Council rules , the temperature is kept above five degrees Centigrade during the journey .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are to believe what the Council says about this European Union of ours wanting to encourage sustainable development , and if we look at the reality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council goes about doing it in practice , we see that the Member States really cannot summon up the will to do it .
yet again , animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up .
I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort , and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better , but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before .
there are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified , and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe .
if we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals , then we need to approach this from a different angle .
the introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does , of course , achieve something ; it means that checks can be better carried out .
there is no disputing that .
likewise , if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation , that is of course a small advance , but it does not solve the problem .
if you want regional development , this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it , for you can raise animals , fatten them up , and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other .
I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress .
I cannot see it as such .
it patches things up , without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the torment these animals undergo .
Mr President , I am a severe critic of the damage the EU has done to Britain and a passionate advocate of Britain &apos;s withdrawal from it .
the European Union destroys jobs - as Tony Blair said in his 1983 election address .
it has also passed legislation that has led to the closure of hundreds of local abattoirs .
however , this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission .
the decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues .
over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit .
were this not bad enough , even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive , and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing .
to those in the outside world - the real world - who are as appalled as I am by all this , I have a simple message .
I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less , for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question .
Mr President , the welfare of animals during transit has been a matter of continuing concern for Parliament over recent years .
I venture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the plight of the millions of children dying of starvation or living in unacceptable conditions in contemporary Europe .
if the humanitarian organisations acting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their counterparts promoting the cause of animals , something could probably have been done to help the European children dying day after day .
I shall be more specific .
Parliament has issued two opinions on animal welfare in transit over the last three years .
I do not believe it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter , as fortunately it was finally settled this November , following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union .
in my view , the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better .
it contained a reasonable restriction on journey times , taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union .
I would remind the House of the times in question , namely nine hours of journey time plus twelve for rest and a further nine hours of journey time .
the agreement reached today under the Dutch Presidency does not imply any change to existing regulations on journey time .
the decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years .
the postponement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States .
it amounts to stalemate .
nonetheless , I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have overlooked , and which should be brought to the notice of the citizens .
existing regulations already impose a maximum travel time of eight hours when vehicles that do not comply with the welfare standards laid down in the regulations are used .
in addition , these standards have been tightened up by virtue of the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers .
Mr President , I can understand why the Commission has gone along with this solution , because it is a pragmatic one .
the Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage .
however , it is extremely disappointing - as everyone has said - that we could not get something on journey times , one of the key issues ; or on stocking densities .
Member States can adopt tougher legislation .
we in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues , but at the moment we do not have it .
I will certainly press my own government to go further on this .
I am pleased , Commissioner , that you mentioned enforcement .
that is one area where this legislation has fallen down in the past .
you will be aware of the NGOs that have given us video evidence of how this legislation has been by @-@ passed and ignored .
you said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation .
I hope that you do .
I hope you will keep Parliament informed of what happens in the interim .
we want to hear about what is happening with regard to reinforced monitoring .
I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legislation .
we already have a written declaration on journey times .
I am sure that our commitment will remain the same .
Mr President , animal protection should be moved immediately from the agricultural heading and from Article 37 .
it could , of course , be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter , which sounds more reassuring .
in Denmark , it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter .
we regard animal protection as legal protection , but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings .
the poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed .
it is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses , cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU .
animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours .
we have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark .
animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest , food and a change of air , and the accommodation must be in order .
that is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark .
of course , the previous Parliament stated this too , and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected .
when we obtain the new Constitution , Parliament will have the right of codecision and , if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37 , Parliament would now already have had this right .
regarding another matter - namely transparency - our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so , so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now .
what has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through , almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision @-@ making concerned over the next six years .
we , indeed I , have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ...
- Mr President , the problem at issue is of a cross @-@ border nature and cannot be solved by national legislation alone .
for this reason , it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament .
for years , Parliament has been inundated with petitions from people rightly calling for attention to abuses in animal transport .
this applies in particular to horses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are destined to be slaughtered and eaten in the South .
many animals spend a very long time in transit in lorries , with little to eat or drink , foul themselves , start to panic and suffer injury .
the only way to prevent this is to drastically reduce the distance and time permitted for the transport of live animals .
at the start of 2004 , the dispute in this Parliament was a question of eight hours versus nine hours of continuous transport and of limited , cheap protective measures versus further @-@ reaching , more expensive measures .
at that time , Parliament made a very moderate choice , but even that went too far for the governments of a number of Member States .
as a result , there is still scope for allowing those abuses to continue .
the key question is whether we accept this unnecessary animal suffering in anticipation of a resulting reduction in the costs of the livestock trade and of road transport companies , or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at variance with our civilisation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow creatures .
my choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility .
what the Commissioner is now announcing is the failure of decision making in the European Union .
we have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urgently needed .
national economic interests are taking precedence over our shared civilisation and responsibility .
listening to Commissioner Kyprianou speak , I have no doubt as to his good intentions .
I support his announcement of new initiatives by the European Commission .
I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all .
satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals .
let us not trust solely in new technologies , but rather build on the political will to genuinely eliminate this abuse .
that is what is important .
I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission , because what is currently taking place is an absolute disgrace .
Mr President , the transport of animals within the EU and from the EU to countries outside it has on quite a few occasions been comprehensively criticised .
most recently , we have received information about the disgraceful conditions under which animals have been exported from the EU to Lebanon .
that worries us .
will the Commission prioritise this problem ?
we hope so , but are not completely convinced .
another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issued by OLAF at regular intervals .
recently , these concerned complaints relating to financial fraud in connection with the transport of animals to Lebanon .
in purely financial terms , subsidies for the export of animals from the EU to third countries total approximately SEK 60 @-@ 100 million per year .
does this amount to properly used tax revenue ?
we hope that the Commission will take animal protection seriously and that we do not have to read further reports concerning misused export subsidies .
Mr President , I thank the Commission for raising this important issue for animals and humans .
there is a failure of implementation , not a failure of regulation .
in fact , in many cases we have over @-@ regulation but also non @-@ implementation .
this has led to problems for farmers and those engaged in what is a very legitimate trade .
one of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers .
the new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market @-@ led farming .
there is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms .
are we going to tell farmers that they cannot engage in this legitimate trade ?
I do not think we can , because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers .
however , animal welfare must of course also be a priority .
one colleague raised concerns about Lebanon .
Irish cattle go to Lebanon .
again , it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there .
if we stop that trade , animals will still move to Lebanon , perhaps from Australia and other areas .
if our concerns are for animals , we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals .
as for reducing journey times and stocking densities , I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion , because this debate has been too much guided by emotion .
I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain .
I shall read one paragraph from the report : &apos; the study concluded that transport had no adverse effect on animal welfare based on the physiological , immunological and haematological measurements made &apos; .
finally , I would just support Mrs Herranz Garcia , who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night .
I raised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starving .
the issues are not linked , but we need to put our priorities right .
MrPresident , I too would like to warmly welcome the political agreement to be presented to the Agriculture Council for formal approval next week .
I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect .
it postpones the most controversial issues until 2011 .
I refer to the issues instrumental in the failure of negotiations last April , namely journey times and stocking densities .
some of the honourable Members present today will recall the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Maat .
it emerged then that , as Mrs McGuinness just stated , there is no solid scientific basis regarding the two issues of journey time and density .
in addition , larger Member States and the peripheral ones were seriously penalised .
all this economic background was presented as an animal welfare issue , as if Members from large and peripheral countries were not concerned about animal welfare .
Commissioner , I believe the political agreement makes good many of the shortcomings identified in current provisions .
this is its most positive aspect .
it improves control systems , it introduces technological features facilitating control , it provides for a clear and transparent system of registration and it improves systems of cooperation between Member States .
in addition , it spells out the duty of setting up training systems that will also improve the transport of animals .
I particularly welcome Article 32 , because it lays down clearly the basis for future reviews of these provisions .
for all these reasons , therefore , I am bound to congratulate the Council for moving the issue forward , and I look forward to successful implementation of the new text .
Mr President , the Commissioner spoke of the emotions that are present in this House .
that this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter , but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never @-@ ending story .
this is not the first time , not the second , and not even the third , but perhaps the umpteenth time that we have had to give this our attention .
for well over ten years , we have sought to make improvements in this area , and there has always been talk of progress , but the crucial progress has not materialised .
we will , I believe , achieve a real breakthrough only when this House acquires the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well .
I believe we are more likely to get that than the satellite navigation system .
it is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way .
turning to the matter in hand , I would like to say that this is , of course , also about transport times , but what is of the essence is whether the conditions are right , that is , whether the animals are carted off in torment or whether they travel as our fellow @-@ creatures .
if someone goes to the Middle East and buys an Arabian stallion for stud purposes , they do not need to worry that it will arrive here in a poor condition .
likewise , if our animals travel to the Olympic Games , they will arrive in a fit and proper state .
it follows that it is the conditions that matter .
what matters , I think , is that we should comply with what the consumers want .
in Germany , we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria .
organic farming is another example , with the nearest slaughterhouse being the one that is used .
where that is a measure of quality , it will also become accepted practice .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , terrible things occur during the transport of animals .
animals suffer from human callousness and thoughtlessness , and improving their fate is a challenge to our humanity .
it is not merely sensitivity to the harm done to animals that makes action necessary , but also the awareness that it is only a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans .
the regulation under discussion moves in the right direction .
it introduces higher standards for the protection of animals in transport , although these standards are still inadequate , and it leads one to hope that animals will suffer less .
as an MEP whose voters include Polish farmers , I am delighted at this .
in Polish family @-@ owned farms , which are mainly small , animals are treated with great affection , and even as individuals .
it breaks farmers &quot; hearts when the animals they cared for are treated brutally after being sold .
the regulation we are discussing will bring progress , but it is not a solution to the problem .
legal regulations must be accompanied by effective implementation , which can be fraught with difficulty .
Poland , for example , is a large transit country and it experiences problems with the transport of horses .
legal standards have been put in place , but the monitoring bodies , police and veterinary inspectors are often helpless when faced with the problem of what to do with illegal transports , carrying injured animals for instance .
there is a need for a network of stopover points where transported animals could be provided with food and drink or given necessary veterinary care .
in urgent cases , the animals could be put down at these points if necessary .
the European Union should provide financial support for the setting up of such a network , and Poland at any rate requires such assistance .
ladies and gentlemen , a genuine breakthrough in the transport of animals will only come about when long @-@ distance transports are fully abolished .
animals should be slaughtered close to where they have been bred .
humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this .
sanitary considerations are also at issue .
I would remind you that as shown by the recent report of the Court of Auditors , control is practically lost over animals transported abroad .
ladies and gentlemen ...
Mr President , there is no doubt that this is an area that makes a big impression upon the European population .
last year alone , one animal protection organisation collected 500.000 signatures in Denmark , that is to say half a million signatures in a country with only just over five million inhabitants .
all the more reason for criticising the way in which this proposal has been hurried through .
as a Member of the European Parliament , I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted .
it might well actually have been the case , Commissioner , that if there had been a little more time in which to debate this issue and if there had been a public debate surrounding it in the individual countries of Europe , the ministers would have been rather more amenable .
I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today .
I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure .
the big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market .
the internal market is of course a splendid and commendable thing but , once in a while , we must also pause and bear some ethical considerations in mind .
we are now treating animals as if they were commodities .
animals are not commodities .
animals are living beings and must , of course , be treated as such .
I would also question whether the proposal that has now unfortunately become legislation is at all tenable in purely legal terms .
in purely legal terms , can there be any defence of Parliament &apos;s being deprived of influence , as it has been ?
when this legislation is revised , or in other words re @-@ examined , it will be possible to bypass Parliament .
as I see it , that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the previous speaker mentioned the internal market , but the internal market must be judged by whether or not it operates in a humane way , and by what its effects are not only on human beings but also on other creatures .
where animal transports are concerned , the issue is clear : whom does it benefit when animals are transported over long distances ?
it is to the benefit of mass livestock farming , a form of livestock farming that will get Europe nowhere .
what we need is not just the right measures , but also stringent checks , and this is where the attitude of the Member States cannot be described as anything other than truly shameful .
if we are to have these checks , we need an infrastructure , and this infrastructure also means resting points , for which we must make provision , and loading stations where vehicles must be obliged to dock when the provisions on the protection of animals in transit are breached .
that must be enforced , and we - this House and the Commission - must together require the Member States , once and for all , to implement in practice a new strategy for agriculture .
Mr President , I think Commissioner Kyprianou has a difficult task in front of him in trying to persuade us that the November Council compromise is a genuinely positive step forward when it comes to live animal exports .
we know it is not , and I think you know it is not , Commissioner .
it is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account .
I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal ; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density .
as a result , it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come .
I notice , however , that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals .
I welcome that , and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible , and in particular to introduce a maximum eight @-@ hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals .
you can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this , even more so if we have codecision .
it is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society .
.
Mr President , I have noted with great interest the views expressed by Members .
I share most of your concerns and most of your views .
however , as I have already said , the Commission felt that there was a need for immediate action .
some of you said that this compromise has been rushed through .
but at the same time , some of you said that this has been pending for more than ten years .
I believe , therefore , that we had an obligation to find a solution as soon as possible , without just saying that we would not continue these efforts for improvement .
it is true that Member States can do more .
they can adopt stricter rules , not just for animals originating from their territory but also for transit animals .
so there could be , through this , a possibility of stricter regulations covering a much wider area and affecting much more transport .
as far as the subsidies are concerned I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right - because of various international agreements - to legislate on movement of animals outside the territory , nevertheless the European Union has linked the export subsidies to animal welfare requirements during transport .
therefore to link the two is a substantial step as it brings compliance to a great extent , even though not through immediate legislation .
I agree that implementation is very important .
we will put greater emphasis on the issue of travel times , including all the other improvements that need to be made .
we will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage .
therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal .
on the staging point , this regulation has increased both the welfare situation and the bio @-@ security situation .
even though I understand and share the disappointment of many of you with regard to this regulation , at the same time , we must not , through this emotional approach , disregard significant improvements that have been made to the regulation .
travel times are very important - that is why they were included in the Commission proposal ; but conditions during travel are just as important .
they are being improved and dealt with in the regulation .
the Commission examined the legal problems referred to in the way in which the decision was taken .
I can assure you that we checked with the legal services and everything was done in a proper legal way .
while I share your concerns , we feel that this was a good compromise .
it has gone the right way .
some of us might have wanted to go one step further , or take one step less , but it is nevertheless going in the right direction .
the Commission will continue to monitor and follow the implementation . implementation is in the hands of the Member States .
agreement on any future proposal coming from the Commission will again , in the final analysis , be in the hands of the Member States .
therefore it is something on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the report by Sérgio Ribeiro ( A6 @-@ 0037 / 2004 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 850 / 98 as regards the protection of deep @-@ water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean ( COM ( 2004 ) 0058 - C5 - 0074 / 2004 - 2004 / 0020 ( CNS ) ) .
.
Mr President , I thank Mr Ribeiro for his report on the proposal to protect deep @-@ water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean .
this is the first time I have addressed the plenary of this Parliament and it is satisfying that the first proposal that I am dealing with is focused upon the protection of deep @-@ water coral reefs - an issue of great importance to us all .
doubtless , we will have many an occasion in future , both within this plenary and within the Committee on Fisheries , to discuss issues not only relating to conservation and the preservation of fish stocks but also relating to issues such as deep @-@ water coral reefs .
having studied the scientific evidence and considering the irreversible damage that certain fishing gear can cause to these unique habitats , we propose in this regulation to ban the use of bottom trawls and similar trawl gear in the areas concerned .
with this proposal , we fulfil the commitment given at the Fisheries Council of 23 October 2003 , when the new &apos; western waters &apos; regulation was approved to ensure protection for these habitats .
I am happy to note that the rapporteur recommends that Parliament approve these measures , as does the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion .
the Commission welcomes the adoption of measures to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems .
they show our determination to work for the integration of environmental concerns in the common fisheries policy , as envisaged in the reform of 2002 , and as repeatedly called for by public opinion .
I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us .
I can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 .
however , I have difficulty in accepting Amendment No 4 , since it is not in line with the legislation on the mandate that is given to regional advisory councils .
these councils are to be consulted on the development of proposals for legislation , but consultation of them is not envisaged on the implementation of such legislation .
as for Amendment No 5 , the Commission has difficulty accepting the substance of this amendment as it is currently worded .
the Commission is bound to review all proposals in the light of new scientific evidence .
hence , obliging the Commission to do so in a specific timeframe could also work against the spirit and purpose of the proposal .
furthermore , we need to be conscious of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is very much dependent on the Member States and , therefore , the Commission is not in a position to guarantee its availability as prescribed in the amendment , that is , within a specified timeframe .
on Amendment No 6 , the Commission notes that while it could find such an amendment acceptable , it is not really necessary since the geographical application of the regulation is well known and already established .
as for Amendment No 7 , in accordance with scientific advice , the main threat to the very fragile deep @-@ water habitats is bottom trawling .
damage caused by other gear , in particular specific gear such as gillnets and longlines , may be real , but is very minor compared to the erosion effects of trawls .
furthermore , extending the prohibition on trawling throughout the European economic zone would appear to be excessive , i.e. would appear not to be proportionate since the majority of this area does not have submarine features threatened by fishing .
in these circumstances , the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7 .
finally , the Commission has difficulty accepting Amendment No 8 , because it would create a duplication of effort .
comprehensive revisions of the status of deep @-@ water features are currently being carried out by the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea , ICES .
this is considered to be sufficient .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the process of drawing up , discussing and voting on this report in committee was quite a surprising learning process , showing that it is never too late to learn and to carry on learning .
I tackled an activity with which I was only superficially familiar and , in particular , I supplemented all the theoretical knowledge that documents and studying could provide .
by contacting and receiving information from those connected with the activity , those who make it their difficult livelihood , those who study it thoroughly and seriously and those who have responsibilities within it , I learnt a lot and I know that there is still a lot to learn .
I started with the idea that we need to protect the environment , which is subject to attacks that are likely to get worse , and I found three questions taking shape : which predatory activities should be moderated or banned ?
within what limits ?
under what jurisdiction ?
after much listening and considerable thought , I became convinced that a ban on bottom trawling would not be enough to protect coral reefs and other formations , among which I would highlight thermal vents .
it was proved to me that bottom gill @-@ netting was equally predatory or even more so .
that is why I explicitly included it .
why is there such resistance to its inclusion ?
is it because powerful interests use that method ?
the Commission argues that it is because there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the evils of the technique .
even if that were so , however , the precautionary principle should apply .
the delimitation of the areas to be protected is defined in the Commission &apos;s proposal by the criterion of degrees of longitude and latitude .
I consider this option to be political and not technical , or at least not only technical but with a strong political meaning .
not using the criterion of miles offshore means that the connection with national exclusive economic zones can be ignored or minimised as something to be forgotten .
in view of the negotiations , after the period that ended in November 2003 , to change the regulatory limits from 200 to 12 and then to 50 and finally to 100 miles , the failure of the Commission proposal to consider the situation created in the zone between the 100 and 200 mile limits is , in my view , serious and needs to be remedied .
all that brings us to the key issue of jurisdiction , starting with the simple omission of the national jurisdictions of Spain and Portugal , which was not omitted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom &apos;s jurisdiction over the reef formations of the Darwin Mounds off the Scottish coast .
might that mean that jurisdiction is attributed to the United Kingdom but is denied or forgotten - or hidden - in the case of Spain and Portugal ?
we are thus arriving at some really sensitive , fundamental issues , of the kind that life imposes when we get down to practicalities .
the principle of the European Union &apos;s exclusive competence over the conservation of marine biological resources is thus enshrined in this proposal even before the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty .
such a decision is highly debatable and , for us , unacceptable , insofar as it represents the replacement of national and regional competence over part of the national territory , albeit under the sea , with exclusive Community competence .
the points that are clearly under discussion here are as follows : firstly , the balance between the exploitation of resources and their conservation .
secondly , this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and predatory and the conservation of marine biological resources was under national and regional jurisdiction on the basis of proximity , and there are therefore no grounds to replace this jurisdiction in order to remedy incorrect or lax practices .
thirdly , there are two kinds of fishing - costal fishing , which is , more or less , or still is almost traditional , and industrial fishing .
the former is penalised , with a terrible impact on society and the regional economies , by the predatory nature of the latter , which , because of its economic and political power , will more easily continue its activities .
fourthly , the negotiations that are starting on total allowable catches and quotas are an indictment of equal treatment for what is different and a refutation of strategies which , on the pretext of protecting the environment , help the &apos; big fish &quot; to swallow up the &apos; little fish &quot; - and the word &apos; fish &quot; can be replaced with others such as &apos; boats , &quot; &apos; fleets , &quot; &apos; interests &quot; or &apos; countries . &quot;
my report and the draft amendments that I have submitted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tried to make clear in this speech , in the hope that this House will vote for it .
I am grateful for your vote and I am also grateful for all the help and collaboration that I have had in tabling this report .
Mr President , I shall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on behalf of Mrs Hassi .
when we discuss this issue , we need to imagine how it would be if the destruction taking place on the sea bed were instead to happen on land .
imagine if forests were to be uprooted , if all the animals in them were to die and if the birds were to become silent .
people would be up in arms .
we would all drown in letters from anxious people demanding that the forests be protected .
now , this is happening on the sea bed .
the forests of the sea are coral reefs at the bottom of the sea , among fish that are unable to cry out .
we here in Parliament must therefore speak on behalf of these bio- and eco @-@ systems without a voice .
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments .
I wish therefore to emphasise that the House should support Amendment No 8 , which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety but which , unfortunately , was rejected by the Committee on Fisheries .
we must investigate what other deep @-@ sea habitats need to be protected so that we might obtain a complete list of these .
we must , of course , do this in cooperation with the ICES to avoid duplication of effort , but we must take responsibility for this list &apos;s being compiled .
I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7 , which picks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than trawl nets that can damage the sea bed .
that is why the rules should , of course , cover all equipment that may damage the sea bed , and it is wise to use the precautionary principle in these sensitive areas .
I think , however , that we should retain the Commission &apos;s proposal concerning zones and thus vote against the second half of the amendment .
the zones have a scientific basis we are able to accept .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal , which has been adopted by this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Fisheries , seeks to prevent the use of a fishing technique that is highly damaging to the extremely fragile marine systems of deep @-@ water corals , which not only contribute their own richness to biodiversity but are also important ecological habitats for various organisms at various stages in their life cycles .
according to the Commission , protection is given to the areas around Madeira , the Azores and the Canaries , outermost archipelagos where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for centuries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preserve species but also to maintain thriving fishing communities .
at a time when we are witnessing growing concern about the maintenance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas devastated by overfishing , the sustainable fishing practised in those archipelagos deserves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it .
besides , we are talking about areas where there is no continental shelf and therefore the places where fishing is possible are confined to small seamounts generally associated with those deep @-@ water corals .
it can be said that there is a lot of water around those archipelagos but there are not many fish or fishing areas .
it is therefore essential to safeguard and protect those areas from the destructive - highly destructive - activities of industrial fisheries .
the emergency measures put in place are already a help but we have to have lasting solutions , and for that reason this Commission proposal is laudable .
nonetheless , the proposed amendments to widen the ban on nets to include bottom gill nets make complete sense to me .
because of the anchors used and the risk of loss , they can cause ghost fishing and also seabed erosion , threatening the ecological balance of the deep @-@ water corals .
I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be widened to include gill nets and also to include the 200 @-@ mile zones , because this proposal is based on maintaining what existed until very recently .
with my knowledge of the situation , I can guarantee that by adopting these proposals we will be helping to protect the environment and the sustainable kind of fishing that we think should be based more on prevention than on cure .
. - Mr President , I should like to address a special welcome to the Commissioner on the occasion of his first speech and to offer him our best wishes for the extremely important and difficult job that he has to do .
I should also like to tell him , however , that I find it quite incomprehensible in this report that , after the mistake was made to liberalise bottom trawling and bottom gill nets a year ago in Regulation ( EC ) No 1954 / 2003 , this mistake is not being corrected in respect of bottom gill nets .
having read the documents produced by the Commission , which are quite specific in indicating that bottom gill nets are extraordinarily harmful and damaging to the environment , we are at a loss to understand why the Commission wants to impose this practice in the Autonomous Region of the Azores , where it has never been allowed .
that is a backward step in nature conservation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions , which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable .
Commissioner , I ask you to think this matter over more carefully .
Mr President , Mr Ribeiro &apos;s excellent report is on the second Commission proposal seeking to protect deep @-@ water coral reefs from the effects of trawling .
the first concerned reefs off the north @-@ west coast of Scotland , the Darwin Mounds , for which I was fortunate enough to be rapporteur .
as with that report , it is essential to appreciate just how important deep @-@ water coral reefs are for the marine ecosystem .
they can maintain hundreds of different species of wildlife , including many species of deep @-@ sea fish , and they are a vital focus for fish reproductive cycles .
in the case of deep @-@ sea fish , gestation periods are extremely long and thus any negative impacts on the habitats will have serious effects on stocks , both in the short and the long term .
we are still gathering research on the full impact of trawling on deep @-@ sea coral reefs , but it certainly appears that in the short span of time since deep @-@ sea trawling began , hundreds or possibly thousands of seamounts and coral reef systems may have been devastated .
the ALDE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee , particularly Amendment No 4 emphasising the role of regional advisory councils .
we commend to you the other amendments as adopted in committee .
we endorse plenary Amendment No 8 as well , since it is important to examine what other areas of deep @-@ sea coral within the EU should be closed to harmful fishing methods .
we can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7 , since that fits with the precautionary approach .
after considerable thought , we cannot support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of leaving some of the coral unprotected .
that is with real regret , since the motivation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of conservation .
we hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seriousness of the concerns being expressed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the excellent report by Mr Ribeiro on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of deep @-@ water coral reefs from the effects of demersal fishing , more generally termed &apos; trawling , &quot; is timely and borne out by many studies in this area .
as we all know , the impact on these environments - and this is also true for all types of marine environment where indiscriminate fishing methods are used - affects not only pelagic and edible sessile species , but also inedible sessile organisms and , more generally , it seriously damages key breeding environments .
this leads to resource depletion and a resulting loss of economic potential , with serious consequences for local communities , particularly small @-@ scale traditional fishing businesses .
in addition to the reasons given in the international agreements referred to in the report , the protection of such environments is therefore an important way to achieve not only environmental protection but also stable social and economic prospects for the communities which persevere in the areas in question .
this is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional resource which , as such , ought to be safeguarded , not only by limiting the industrial catch by fleets from other countries , but also by ensuring the continued existence of breeding habitats .
to that end , it is vital to involve the local communities , and especially those people involved in the sector .
I therefore believe that the authorities , local firms and associations in the sector , with the help of the Community institutions , in addition to watching over the protected areas should also be responsible for the regular scientific monitoring of habitats , as well as for providing eco @-@ friendly information and ensuring the professional conduct of those involved in fishing .
it would certainly also be a good idea to encourage the productivity of small traditional businesses by giving them modern tools for researching , identifying and catching their resources , so as to promote greater catch selectivity in the marine environment and to make it possible for businesses like those to survive competition from industrial fishing fleets , particularly Japanese and US ones .
Mr President , I must begin by saying how surprised I was to hear Mr Ribeiro , the rapporteur , speak in favour of amendments rejected by a majority of the Committee on Fisheries .
I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission &apos;s proposal , namely the Ribeiro report , as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries .
we shall be voting against the amendments tabled , for the reasons I am about to give .
we are opposed to the inclusion of bottom set gill nets because , as everyone is aware , these are static nets .
by their very nature , they do not erode the sea bottom .
the amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster .
at most , this could be linked to the loss of these nets and subsequent so @-@ called ghost fishing As the Commissioner stated , there is no scientific data relating to areas or species .
this is why I think it is somewhat flippant and a bad precedent to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the areas in question .
indeed , to follow the arguments through , the gear would have to be banned from all Community waters .
it would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban .
I shall now turn to the second amendment .
on the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology , this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200 @-@ mile political criterion .
it should be pointed out that , rightly or wrongly , that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law .
I must emphasise once again that coral reefs are not located exclusively within a 200 @-@ mile radius from the Canary Islands , Madeira and the Azores .
the scientific community accepts that coral reefs are generally found around a 1.000 metre bathymetric line .
in accordance with the precautionary principle , the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1.500 metre bathymetric line These lines do not of course tally with political and administrative demarcations .
in addition , in this particular instance , the zones designated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200 @-@ mile limit in some cases .
international waters are affected .
Mr President , these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled .
Mr President , I welcomed the Ribeiro report when it appeared , and recognised the rapporteur &apos;s effort .
this was because , along with the whole House , I believe it is important to protect deep @-@ water coral reefs .
I am bound to say , however , that I have been very surprised at some of the comments made by the rapporteur subsequently .
I endorse what Mrs Fraga has just said , and can only hope that little flags similar to those evident elsewhere in the Chamber do not suddenly appear in front of Mr Ribeiro .
I must emphasise that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7 .
we certainly support the Commission &apos;s proposal , but we cannot agree to the addition of bottom set gill nets without any scientific justification .
the Commission &apos;s proposal makes a reference to bottom set gillnets or similar gear .
we believe that the addition of bottom set gill nets with no further qualification could be very detrimental to certain fleets .
it could also act as a dangerous precedent .
we do not support the second part of the amendment either .
this is because it seeks to replace maritime locations established by the Commission on the basis of scientific criteria with a reference to waters under the jurisdiction of Member States .
Mr President , deep @-@ water coral reefs are a resource which deserves our protection .
according to the United Nations , deep @-@ water coral reefs are a vulnerable habitat which require special attention .
ICES advises that the only way to protect cold @-@ water habitats from fishing damage is to map the habitats precisely and to close those areas to the forms of fishing that cause damage .
the only way to protect deep @-@ water coral reefs is to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gears .
it was early this year that this House recognised deep @-@ water coral reefs , when the Darwin Mounds , off the north @-@ west coast of Scotland , were given special status as an area of conservation .
now we turn to the other deep @-@ water coral reefs off the Canary Islands and around Madeira and the Azores , and I hope there will be continuation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis .
deep @-@ water coral reefs should not be destroyed by bottom trawling , but should be protected for future generations to enjoy .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too essentially want to express my support for Mr Ribeiro &apos;s report and the proposals it contains .
ensuring the sustainability of marine biological resources is also the best way to protect the most threatened of all species in certain parts of the Union : the human species itself .
many of the fishing communities in some coastal areas of the Union , such as the Azores or Madeira , do not have any other alternatives at all for their livelihoods or their survival .
in this case , it is the Commission itself that acknowledges that we are dealing with very sensitive ecosystems that are highly endangered and require urgent protection , particularly since there is a considerable lack of information about them .
the simple acknowledgment of such facts is more than enough reason to adopt any preventive measures that might stop the destruction of those habitats .
the proposals put forward by the rapporteur are a step in that direction .
they will therefore gain my vote and I appeal to this House to vote for them as well .
.
Mr President , I welcome the generally positive comments on the proposal , and will respond very briefly to some of the criticisms made .
on the possible damage by fishing other than trawls : according to the ICES 2003 report , trawls are the main cause of damage to deep @-@ water coral reefs .
there is little evidence of passive gear damaging coral reefs , although ICES mentions some of these effects .
the Commission is ready to amend its proposal if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member States agree on such an amendment .
with regard to the point concerning the extension of the protective zone to the whole EEZ , I would underline that the proposal delimited an area that includes most of the submarine mountains that have been kept in good condition .
extending the zone of prohibition would add insignificant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of proportionality .
having said that , I would also refer to the question of the exclusive competence of the Commission with regard to marine resources , which is found in the Constitution and to which reference has been made .
this is a principle which was already established by European Court of Justice case law , and all the Constitution does is to codify it .
however , the Commission does not deny the rights of Spain and Portugal over their European Economic Zone .
it is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimited by topography and by geographical features .
on the point made by Mrs Attwooll concerning the role of the regional advisory councils , there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amendment the regulation on RACs would itself have to be amended .
on another point made by Mrs Attwooll , the Commission has recently tabled a proposal on conditions for deep @-@ water fishing , which will lend protection to these important resources .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 11.30 a.m .
I should like to welcome a delegation from the parliament of Serbia and Montenegro , who have come to Strasbourg in order to take part in their first interparliamentary meeting with the European Parliament , and who are seated in the official gallery .
the delegation is led by the parliament &apos;s president , Mr Zoran Sami .
I hope that this event marks the beginning of fruitful cooperation between our two institutions .
the next item is the vote .
( 1 )
Mr President , I should like to give notice of some technical amendments before the vote .
I have been mandated to do so by the Committee on Budgets .
I refer to Budget Line 15 03 01 02 - Leonardo da Vinci Programme , where the amount shown under commitments should be modified to read EUR 205.366.880 .
in Budget Line 19 09 03 - Aid to displaced persons in Latin American countries , the relevant amount from the reserve should be entered , namely EUR 54.500 less than the amount given in Document 12 .
I trust the House will agree to these amendments .
if there are no objections , Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s technical amendments are accepted .
Mr President , there is nothing secret about the statement I now make on the basis of Rule 157 ; on the contrary , I make it openly .
our group has had a discussion about the amount to be approved under item 3 .
this has to do with a great gathering in the Rhineland , from which I come , where the Catholic Church , among other bodies , is organising a great gathering of young people .
I myself am familiar with this meeting , having once been able , in another capacity , to take part in it .
it is a good thing .
this meeting is to include a state visit by the Pope .
his Holiness will be attending this meeting , and what we would like to be certain of is that the gathering &apos;s organisers are asked to provide the EU institutions with documentary confirmation that none of this money will be used to fund the Pope &apos;s state visit .
the Vatican itself will have to pay for that .
Mr President , this is a point of order under the same Rule under which you allowed Mr Schulz to speak .
I should like to note that this is a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure , as well as of the principles of good taste .
Mr Schulz appears not to understand that the spirit and ethical and moral principles exist alongside the law .
I should like to remind Mr Schulz of this fact .
the budget is approved .
does the Council wish to comment , or is it satisfied with Parliament &apos;s approval ?
Mr President , you have proceeded to your second reading on the 2005 budget - the first full budgetary year of the European Union of 25 Member States and of the implementation of the new Staff Regulations .
I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions during the conciliation meeting on 25 November 2004 has now been included in the 2005 budget .
it is very important that for the first year of the new term of this Parliament the two arms of the budgetary authority were able to reach global agreement last November .
it is a positive signal for the future , both for interinstitutional cooperation and for a good budget for the European Union .
that is why I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lewandowski , and the two rapporteurs , Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen .
I would also like to thank the Commissioner , Mrs Grybauskaitė , whose role I have appreciated very much .
the Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading .
thank you very much , Minister .
Mr President , I should like to table an oral amendment to Recital A very briefly - .
the amendment involves entering the relevant amounts .
I shall read it in Spanish :
&apos;A. whereas the Budget for 2005 as adopted by the Parliament amounts to EUR 116.554.135.698 in commitments , which represents an increase of 6.1 % on the 2004 budget ; and EUR 106.300.000.000 in payments , which represents an increase of 4.4 % on the 2004 Budget ; whereas this level of payments represents 1.004 % of estimated GNI for the year 2005 , compared to 1.08 % as established by the Financial Perspective , a difference of EUR 7.935 million , &quot;
Mr President , could you slow matters down , because the translations , which are being relayed , are reaching us at the time of the following vote ?
take account of the translations intended for the new Member States , which are not done as quickly as those for the old Member States .
( 2 )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to give a very brief explanation of why our group has withdrawn its support for this joint motion for a resolution .
the Socialist Group in the European Parliament was opposed in principle to this procedure , it being our belief that the Commission should first present its programme , with Parliament then stating its position with respect to it .
we did not manage to get this accepted by the Conference of Presidents and the procedure was adopted .
up to a certain point , we were able to support the wording of the resolution as it stands ; it also includes many points that we can live with and accept .
there are , however , a number of essential elements in this text that lead us in this Group - after a long debate yesterday evening - to believe at present that it is the Commission that should first state its position on these points rather than Parliament .
we therefore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State , under which the government first presents its programme and the parliament then states where it stands on it .
that is what should be done in this instance too , and so we now expect the Commission to present its programme .
we will not be participating in this vote .
Mr President , if the Socialist Group has been able to say what it thinks about this procedure under Rule 152 , then other groups should also be allowed to do so .
we are very disappointed that the PSE Group has withdrawn its name from the joint text , even though it was negotiated by two of their vice @-@ chairmen .
we also hope that the PSE Group realises that by voting against the compromise it is taking the risk that Parliament will not have a position on the new Commission &apos;s strategic policy objectives .
does the PSE Group really want this to happen and spoil the reputation of the European Parliament ?
I think the House has been enlightened by the positions expressed by Mr Schulz and Mrs Ek .
we support the idea of having a flexibility instrument in the EU budget in order to obtain a budgeting margin for purely unforeseen expenditure .
the objectives must then be dealt with under separate arrangements .
they may in themselves be of quite different kinds .
for example , the Peace II programme is something justified in terms of its being an internal matter for the EU , while we are opposed to the EU &apos;s being involved , as an organisation , in funding the reconstruction of Iraq .
the Member States themselves must decide about such efforts in accordance with democratic decisions in each of those States .
. - As we all know , the flexibility instrument , which has a ceiling of EUR 200 million , is intended to allow financing in a given financial year of specifically identified expenditure which could not be financed within the ceilings available for one or more other headings .
it is an extremely important mechanism for solving emerging needs .
in the specific case of this year , I also consider it essential that the European Union should mobilise the flexibility instrument to finance the Community &apos;s involvement in the rehabilitation , reconstruction and stabilisation of Iraq , as pledged at the Madrid Ministerial Conference , and also to support the peace consolidation process in the Republic of Ireland , which has been experiencing growing instability .
with regard to the issue of the decentralised agencies , I believe the time has come to find a structural solution to the ever @-@ increasing volume of funding that they need , and to reconcile their funding with the needs of internal policies .
overall , I voted in favour .
. - This proposal to reject the budget for 2005 , which my group put forward and to which I made a significant contribution , is not only appropriate but also consistent .
it helps to clarify the responsibilities of those political forces which deal out criticism but do not match it with action .
I therefore regret the rejection of the rejection .
the proposal for rejection is appropriate , because this is the first full year of the enlarged EU , with its additional cohesion requirements , and a key year in the debate on the Financial Perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
it is therefore unacceptable to produce a Community budget for 2005 that has only been set above 1 % of the Community GNI ( by thousandths of a per cent ) for psychological reasons , while it hides its clear concordance with the objectives of the signatories to the &apos; Letter of the Six &quot; to continue the 2004 budget , the lowest in relative terms since 1987 .
many thanks , Mr President .
I should like to explain that I voted in favour of Amendment No 127 in Section III on funding for World Youth Day , because this does not form part of an official state visit .
instead it is a meeting of young European Christians with the most noble of goals .
if it were not for Mr Schulz &apos;s ideological obstinacy , he would be able to see how much Europe could benefit from a meeting between its young people and the Holy Father .
if it were not for Mr Schulz &apos;s ideological obstinacy and reluctance to take an honest approach to the issue , he would not have confused it with an official visit by a head of state , namely the Pope &apos;s visit to the Federal Republic of Germany .
. - I took an active role in the conciliation meetings which reached agreement on the European Union budget for 2005 .
that is good reason to feel proud and satisfied .
failure of the negotiations on the enlarged EU &apos;s first budget would have been a terrible political signal to send out to Europe &apos;s citizens .
it would have been a sign of our inability to govern ourselves with 25 Member States .
all Community policies will be duly funded in 2005 , in accordance with the established priorities .
compared with 2004 , this budget will have an increase of 6.5 % and will rise above the symbolic value of 1 % of GNI .
the Council , Parliament and the Commission have agreed to a statement by which the level of payments will be examined in mid @-@ 2005 and , if necessary , the budget lines in question will be supplemented .
Portugal &apos;s priorities are taken into account financially in 2005 .
there is greater provision for regional and cohesion policy , as well as for the common agricultural policy with its pilot projects , and there are more funds for concluding agreements on fisheries .
a budget is evidence of the credibility of the objectives that have been set out .
it is pointless to make grand political statements without providing the funding to put such intentions into practice .
the budget for 2005 is therefore a credible instrument .
the budget resolution states that the European Parliament regrets the Council &apos;s comprehensive reduction in payments in the agricultural sphere .
we , Mr Andersson , Mrs Hedh , Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , Mrs Segelström and Mrs Westlund , do not agree with this .
we see no reason for wanting , in the agricultural sphere , to increase payments further in relation to the Council &apos;s proposal .
.
the Moderate delegation has today abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution .
the resolution contains much that is laudable in our view but , because we voted against quite a few of the proposed expenditure increases in the vote on the figures for the budget , it was impossible for us fully to support the resolution &apos;s conclusions .
we do not agree with the general criticism made of the Council for having reduced the size of the budget .
that is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid .
we are pleased that the Council is taking a step in the right direction by reducing this .
we believe , however , that agricultural policy is in need of radical reform and we should therefore have preferred there to have been further reductions .
we chose to vote in favour of Mr Garriga Polledo &apos;s and Mrs Jensen &apos;s report in spite of paragraph 2 , which regrets the Council &apos;s reduction in payments to agriculture .
that is a paragraph we cannot support .
it is unacceptable for the same budgetary line to contain two items of funding as distinct as that for the sixtieth anniversary of the end of fascism and that for the Pope &apos;s visit to Cologne .
I dare to hope that this bizarre collusion is not the result of any shameful bargaining .
the gathering of young people that the latter event would attract must not be funded from the European budget , but by the Catholic Church , which the event will serve to promote .
I am voting against this expenditure at a time when so many other spontaneous initiatives by young people do not manage to benefit from European credits .
. - Our position is clear and well known : we are against the war and the US @-@ British occupation in Iraq and we demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from that country .
that position justifies rejection of the proposal that the European Union should finance the reconstruction of Iraq out of its Community budget .
of course , we support the increase in humanitarian and food aid to the Iraqi population , but we cannot accept that our aid should be used to legitimise what happened or to benefit the aggressor .
leaving aside positions of principle , it is unacceptable that that aid should be financed to the detriment of the European Union &apos;s cooperation and development policy - in other words , at the expense of the less developed countries - just as it is also unacceptable that there should be no multiannual framework programme , as there was in the case of the Balkans .
we are aware that this report deals with the kind of funding to adopt or , in other words , how to mobilise an extra EUR 185 million which would otherwise have to be found by redeployment from other budget headings .
we are also aware that the additional amounts will be used to finance the PEACE programme and the decentralised agencies , and that the agreed amounts are less than what is needed and will not solve the funding requirements .
the June List rejects Parliament &apos;s draft budget for 2005 , which involves the EU &apos;s commitments increasing to 1.24 % of the EU countries &quot; anticipated gross domestic income .
we believe that the commitments for 2005 definitely should not exceed the Commission &apos;s proposal of 1.14 % .
even though the payments still do not exceed 1 % of gross domestic income , these will gradually increase to the level of the commitments in the 2005 budget .
this forms the point of departure for the long @-@ term financial framework .
that is why it is important to come down to a lower level by no later than 2005 .
the aim should be to come down below the expenditure ceiling of 1 % of gross domestic income .
below is a selection of proposed cut @-@ backs :
* We believe that the EU should begin cutting back on agricultural aid by no later than 2005 .
* The subsidy to EU political parties should be completely abolished .
* The subsidy for tobacco cultivation should be abolished .
it should be the responsibility of the individual countries successfully to help the farmers concerned convert to other crops .
* The subsidy for information provision can be reduced because we believe it to be difficult , politically , to provide objective information prior to the referendums on the Constitution .
we believe it is the responsibility of the individual countries and of the political parties in these countries to provide such information .
the EU should avoid interfering in the democratic process in the Member States .
the Danish Liberal Party &apos;s Members of the European Parliament - Mrs Riis @-@ Jørgensen , Mr Busk and Mrs Jensen - voted against Amendment No 3 , tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group .
the Liberal Party is in favour of reforming the payment of travel expenses in such a way that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded .
that is not something that will be guaranteed by this amendment .
. - Consistent with our proposal to reject the Community budget for 2005 , we voted against this report , which reflects the degree of hypocrisy and whitewashing that has run through the budgetary procedure that is now ending .
Parliament is criticising the Council , complaining that it is reducing payments in agriculture , that it does not accept its proposals , that it is unwilling to assess the needs of the European agencies and that it has forced it to make cuts compared with first reading ; more than enough reasons for rejecting it .
despite this scenario , Parliament welcomes the agreement reached with the Council at the conciliation of 25 November and whitewashes the procedure by claiming that , thanks to its efforts , &apos; drastic cuts were avoided &quot; and its traditional priorities were retained , which is manifestly untrue .
unfortunately , that has been the story of all the budgetary procedures since 2000 .
in that time , the flexibility instrument has been used five times in a row , thereby justifying the Portuguese Communist Party &apos;s proposal to review the current financial perspective .
every year , Parliament accepts terms that call even its budgetary powers into question , for the sake of the sacrosanct Stability Pact .
that begs the question , then , of why it wants to strengthen its powers if it does not make use of them .
. - I wish to reiterate the comments already made at first reading , regretting that this draft budget for the financial year 2005 should , overall , total only 1.004 % of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of the 25 European Union Member States .
I should like it to be more ambitious , as is essential after the accession of ten new Member States , and to make sense of the discourse of those who say they want to develop institutional Europe by moving into new policies and areas of responsibility .
in view of the negotiations as a whole , however , and the real economic and financial difficulties of the current situation , I would highlight certain results that were achieved in the difficult conciliation process .
I believe it is significant that we have got past the psychological threshold of the 1 % imposed in the &apos; Letter of the Six , &quot; even if only by a tiny amount .
I consider certain advances to have been positive , namely in the area of maritime safety ( particularly pollution ) and the maintenance of the framework of structural policies and external policies , especially in development aid ; I also welcome the special relationships with ACP countries .
the rapporteur &apos;s comments are realistic and point to a certain inconsistency in the project announced in the Commission &apos;s proposal , that this would be the budget of &apos; competitiveness and cohesion . &quot;
I expect something much better from the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
we believe that the European Union &apos;s policy on fisheries agreements needs to be revised .
over @-@ exploitation of fishing waters forces people into even greater poverty and robs the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain .
it would be better if those countries with which the EU enters into fisheries agreements were instead to be given assistance so that they themselves might develop their own fishing industries .
we do not accept amendments whereby the Commission would be given an independent source of income .
we believe that , if the EU concludes a fisheries agreement with a third country , the total amount of financial compensation for this third country must be funded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels make use of what is offered under the agreement in question .
the Member States should pay in proportion to the size of their catches .
these Member States must then each decide for themselves whether they , in turn , will fund this expenditure by taxing their respective fishing vessels .
. - I voted for this report because of the importance of the issue of fisheries to Portugal , specifically in the case of international fisheries agreements in which the Portuguese fishing industry has a direct interest .
my vote was also based on the fact that an extension of the existing protocol is on the table and the suggested amendments do not damage national interests in any way .
. - This proposal is about addressing the period between the expiry of the protocol attached to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and the date by which the Commission believes the assessments needed to renegotiate the agreement will have been completed .
in view of the considerable activity by the Community fleet in that marine area ( 40 tuna seiners and 25 surface longliners ) , the proposed solution is to extend the previous agreement until a new fisheries protocol has been concluded .
extension will not mean any change to the terms and restrictions of the previous protocol , and the financial compensation and fishing opportunities for the Member States will be maintained .
as the Portuguese fleet has fishing opportunities for five surface longliners in that area , it is important that Portugal should support this extension and press for a favourable renegotiation of the agreement .
I voted for the report .
. - I am delighted at the decision that Article 67 of the Treaty can be fully implemented , so that topics under Title IV , such as immigration , asylum and border controls , can be decided by qualified majority voting under the codecision procedure .
we improve efficiency and we strengthen the role of this Parliament , guaranteeing the principle of democratic legitimacy , which is fundamental for the adoption of legislation on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and others that involve people &apos;s fundamental rights .
I support Mr Bourlanges &apos;s report as well as the two concrete proposals that he makes , because :
- codecision and qualified majority voting on legal immigration are essential for the management of the Union &apos;s migration policy .
with the signing of the Constitution on 29 October 2004 , it was made clear that the measures laid down on legal immigration must not affect the Member States &quot; right to determine the number of third country nationals they can admit to their territories for the purpose of seeking work there .
- the restrictions on the Court &apos;s competences in Title IV that were introduced at Amsterdam , as there were fears of too much work and excessive delays , do not make sense either , given the introduction at Nice of Article 225 ( a ) ...
.
legislation on asylum and immigration policy has for years been profoundly undemocratic .
one thing the Treaty of Amsterdam did was to transfer legislative powers in this area from the Member States to the EC , thus taking it out of the hands of national parliaments ; another was to hand it over to the Council exclusively , and hence to the assembled national executives , with Parliament &apos;s involvement limited to the stating of positions .
in an area such as this , with such considerable implications for fundamental rights , it is untenable that the executive should make law in this way .
this draft Council decision on the adoption of the codecision procedure is thus a long overdue step towards giving Parliament a greater say in legislation .
at the same time , though , the Council is planning to reserve again certain areas exclusively to the executive .
this is precisely what the Bourlanges report criticises , and that is why I endorse the report .
what I see as problematic about this report , however , is that it insists upon a provision in the Constitution whereby Member States can unilaterally bar third @-@ country nationals from gaining access to the labour market .
when I was a member of the Constitutional Convention , I was critical of this rule , which was introduced into the Constitution by the German Government .
not only does it reflect national egoisms , but also - and this is a much more serious matter - it runs counter to the principle that workers should enjoy freedom of movement in a common Europe .
in my judgement , this provision is one of the first things that should be submitted to scrutiny after the Constitution has entered into force .
. - The rapporteur sought to propose that the Court of Justice should have its competence broadened through the revocation of Article 68 of the EC Treaty .
that was an addition to the proposal for a Council decision , in that several areas of Title IV , Part III of the EC Treaty ( visas , asylum , immigration and other policies concerning the free movement of persons ) would then be governed by Article 251 of the EC Treaty .
as I have already argued on other occasions , I think that the Union should gradually consolidate its competences and practices rather than try to satisfy a constant appetite for new competences .
every proposal deals with sensitive material , and the report &apos;s addition suffers from the maximalism typical of a centralising Europe , even though that path does not enjoy popular support .
I am not sure that the proposed revocation would strengthen the legal protection of European citizens and third country nationals in the slightest , as Mr Bourlanges claims it would .
I believe , rather , that it would have exactly the opposite effect .
I think Parliament would do better if it confined itself to supporting the proposal for a decision as presented - which in itself represents a major , ambitious advance for the area of freedom , security and justice - and if it could refrain from embarking on this unhealthy , voracious pursuit of &apos; what lies beyond . &quot;
the measures proposed in the report - those designed to strengthen democracy , human rights and the function of the constitutional state in third countries - are badly required and often necessary .
we wonder , however , whether these measures should be implemented by the EU .
with its long experience and global importance , the UN is better placed to implement them .
we also object to the large sum of money - approximately EUR 225 million - appropriated for these efforts for the period 2005 @-@ 2006 .
the objectives and the efforts concerned are not clearly defined or limited , and experience of the EU &apos;s ability to use such money is not encouraging .
for these reasons , we choose to vote against the report .
. - The subject of the Commission &apos;s proposal , which the rapporteur endorses , is to maintain until the end of 2006 a legal basis and a financial framework for operations to protect and promote human rights and democratic principles in developing countries and other third countries .
I voted for it because I consider that to do so would be both extremely useful and thoroughly justified at a time when very important questions regarding the Community &apos;s foreign policy are at stake .
. - Community funding under the present regulation takes the form of subsidies or contracts , which the Commission is proposing should also be extended to corporate bodies where appropriate .
I agree with that .
participation by civil society should be supported , regardless of the kind of the institutional structure involved in each individual case .
it is imperative that the European Union should continue , improve and intensify the actions described in the Commission communication of 8 May 2001 entitled &apos; The European Union &apos;s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries . &quot;
the European Union is the last window of hope in the eyes of many people .
as the Committee on Foreign Affairs demonstrated ( with only one abstention ) , we must therefore provide the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights ( EIDHR ) with all possible instruments to fulfil its objectives , focusing primarily on support for democratisation , good governance and the rule of law .
for the rest , I refer to the speech I made yesterday during the debate in the House .
I voted for the report , of course .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
I wanted to say that I voted in favour of the report and that I hope we will be able to make considerable progress in this area in future .
I also addressed a question to the new Commission about this , suggesting the introduction of civilian service for young people in the European Union - whether male or female - primarily to create the right conditions in such situations , resulting in a greater sense of responsibility and awareness among the people in the European Union , not only when disasters strike , but also during a civilian service designed to increase solidarity .
as I have said , I am generally in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done along these lines .
. I have voted against the Papadimoulis report today .
a look back reveals this to be consistent with my past voting .
the reason is that , in my opinion , the Community action programme does not pass the subsidiarity test .
the Member States all have their own civil @-@ protection programmes and their own coordination , training and assistance programmes .
some European cooperation is in order , but a separate European centre with its own powers and 24 @-@ hour monitoring is unnecessary .
besides , the financial basis for the proposal is flawed , which is a second reason for me to withhold my support for this proposal .
.
natural disasters such as floods , heat @-@ waves , forest fires , earthquakes , environmental disasters caused by toxic waste release , toxic industrial accidents , serious industrial accidents and terrorist attacks are , by nature , extremely unpredictable , and consequently claim countless victims and cause significant economic damage .
what we must do is work together and exchange information , streamline resources , carry out research and seek technical solutions that limit the damage as far as possible , but most importantly , we must pursue a policy of investing in prevention and education involving political institutions at Community , national , regional and local level and all civil society organisations in a unified , responsible and differentiated partnership .
people say , in their infinite wisdom , that &apos; prevention is better than cure , &quot; and this dictum aptly applies to the forest fires that devastated Portugal in the summers of 2003 and 2004 and to the oil spills from the and tankers .
we welcome the fact that the Community action plan in the field of civil protection has been extended and that its budget has been increased , but we also feel that this is an issue that , in light of its permanent nature , should not be subject to time constraints .
civil protection intervention also falls under the category of mainstreaming : based on new agricultural models and land @-@ use planning that humanises urban and industrial growth ...
there is a significant risk of the financial resources provided going on administration and of the resources thus not being coordinated efficiently enough .
although we are very well disposed towards different countries showing solidarity with one another when disasters occur , we do not believe that this is primarily an issue for the EU , but that the Member States &quot; respective national parliaments should decide what financial resources should be provided when a serious accident occurs in another Member State .
. - We would like to observe that financing of actions for natural and man @-@ made disasters is so limited that , essentially , it cancels out any possibility of material intervention and efficiency .
for us , damage prevention is more important than cure , by which we mean supporting policies , actions and infrastructures which limit damage and losses in the event of disaster .
however , how can this happen when everything is judged by depressing financial criteria and the interests of big business ?
when a series of public competences is transferred to private individuals , how can anyone talk seriously of the adoption of a fundamental policy of protection against any sort of disaster ?
when no money is available for anti @-@ flood works , when anti @-@ earthquake standards are not met , when forests are left at the mercy of arsonists and land cannibals , when shipowners remain unaccountable and unpunished after huge ecological disasters , what protection can we talk of ?
how can efficient civil protection be organised when public goods and services needed in critical situations , such as the fire brigade , are being transferred to private individuals or turned into repressive mechanisms ?
and then , what use is being made of even these crumbs of so @-@ called &apos; restitution ?
if you want a silencing answer , ask the victims of the 1999 earthquake in Greece still living in containers .
.
I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999 / 847 / EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
the aim is to ensure continuity in this area until a new legal instrument enters into force .
the purpose of this programme is to protect the citizens , the environment and property in the event of natural or man @-@ made disasters throughout the Community , by making available additional support from the other participating countries when national response capacities are overwhelmed .
since this programme was adopted , we have seen its effectiveness and the need for action at European level , not least when the was shipwrecked and during the fires of summer 2003 .
furthermore , the report highlights seven areas in which the programme could be improved , most importantly those of cooperation , exchange of information and increased resources .
I should also like to express my support for increasing the annual budget for this programme to EUR 2.4 million per year in 2005 and 2006 .
.
given that the Community &apos;s civil protection programme currently in force expires on 31 December of this year , I believe that it would be entirely appropriate for the programme to be extended for two years to fill the gap between the expiry of the existing programme and the entry into force of the new instrument .
I regret , however , that the programme is to be extended without the necessary reviews of the period 2000 @-@ 2004 being carried out .
on the other hand , the increased funding requested by the Commission is realistic and , in the case of Portugal , particularly important .
I therefore voted in favour .
.
various disasters , such as the accident , the forest fires , particularly in my country , and the floods in the South of France have demonstrated the need for action at European level .
the scale of some disasters often overwhelms national response capacities .
mechanisms at European level , such as the one created by the current programme , are therefore becoming increasingly justified .
the proposal takes a step in this direction , providing for an increase of EUR 1.5 million in 2004 to EUR 2.4 million per year in 2005 and 2006 .
I welcome this development , which forms part of the strengthened cooperation in the area of civil protection , which the EU began to address in the first Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection adopted in 1997 , the most significant development of which was the creation of the Solidarity Fund for major disasters in November 2002 .
the Monitoring and Information Centre is very important , as it provides Member States or third countries with somewhere to send requests for assistance .
a permanent network of contacts has thus been set up within the Commission aimed at establishing uninterrupted contact between the civil protection centres in the participating countries and at promoting the exchange of information .
. the Commission &apos;s proposal is to ban the use of bottom trawls in certain areas that include the seamounts with the most sensitive habitats in the 200 miles around the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands .
similar restrictions are already in place in an area of Northwest Scotland .
I feel that we must go further , and also ban the use of bottom gillnets .
indeed , this type of net also causes serious damage to ecosystems , particularly in the Azores exclusive economic zone , due to the volcanic and rocky nature of its seabed .
various studies have confirmed the sensitive nature of deep @-@ water habitats , such as the deep @-@ water coral reef , thermal vents and feeding grounds for fish of sea banks and seamounts .
.
I wish to offer my wholehearted support for the Commission &apos;s proposal amending Regulation ( EC ) No 850 / 98 , of 30 March , as regards the protection of deep @-@ water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean ( COM ( 2004 ) 58 F ) .
I applaud the Commission for tabling this proposal , because in so doing the Commission is keeping its promise to propose an amendment to the technical measures in force in the Community aimed at banning the use of bottom trawl gear up to at least 200 miles around the outermost regions of the Azores , Madeira and the Canaries , with the aim of protecting ecosystems in some of the most sensitive areas located at the &apos; seamounts &quot; outside 100 miles .
the deep @-@ water habitats that the Commission &apos;s proposal is targeting were until recently protected from trawling ( use of bottom trawl or similar towed nets operating in contact with the bottom of the sea ) , due to the special access regime laid down in accession negotiations .
this regime ceased to apply in August 2004 , and so it was essential to guarantee the continuity of the protection of these areas as part of Community legislation .
.
the protection of the deep @-@ water coral reefs in the Atlantic Ocean is , naturally , of special interest to Portugal .
the proposal is to ban the use of bottom trawling in the waters of the Azores and Madeira , as well as in the Canary Islands , in order to protect deep @-@ water coral reefs , which are of enormous importance in terms of protecting biodiversity .
it is estimated that 65 % of fish species in the sea are dependent on reefs at some point in their life .
in light of this need for effective protection , we are in favour of extending the ban to bottom gillnets , which also cause serious damage to those ecosystems due to ghost fishing .
whilst I am not satisfied with the final result of the vote on the amendments , I wholeheartedly welcome what this report has achieved , and therefore voted in favour .
.
the proposal for a regulation before us seeks to ban the use of bottom trawling in the most environmentally sensitive areas in the first 200 sea miles around the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands .
I broadly support the proposed measures and feel that it is vitally important that the specific characteristics of each area are properly taken into account .
accordingly I also supported the amendment proposals aimed at also banning bottom gillnets , and deeply regret that this measure was not incorporated into the final version drawn up by the committee concerned , contrary to the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation .
along with various Members of this House , I have campaigned for it to be reinstated and adopted in plenary .
it is well known that this kind of net is extremely harmful to ecosystems , particularly given the overwhelming probability of ghost fishing .
in the particular case of the Azores , the risk is all the greater given the volcanic nature of the seabed .
it therefore made no sense only to go halfway towards protection .
.
this is yet another resolution in which the Portuguese socialists ( PS ) , social democrats ( PSD ) and popular right ( CDS @-@ PP ) , using language sprinkled with obfuscations and omissions , reaffirm - together ! - their policy options and the EU &apos;s fundamental axes , namely neoliberalism , federalism and militarism .
it is a package that is &apos; nicely &quot; wrapped up in the language of concern for social issues and of good intentions , a package that seeks to cover up its contradictions and the true nature of the right @-@ wing policy effectively pursued at EU level , with the devastating impact that it has .
the PS , PSD and CDS @-@ PP can try all they like to deflect attention from , or hide , their broad understanding , yet reality is giving the game away .
let us keep that in mind , in Portugal , on 20 February of next year .
there are a number of sensible points of view in the motion for a resolution , but also a number of proposals that it is impossible for us members of the June List to vote in favour of .
in particular , we are opposed to the following four paragraphs of the motion for a resolution .
paragraph 20 : &apos; the European Parliament highlights the continuing need for action to strengthen the EU &apos;s external borders , backed by the creation of a European corps of border guards . &quot;
paragraph 21 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; urges that a European Agency for fundamental rights be established to monitor their application effectively . &quot;
last part of paragraph 33 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; urges continued parallel reform of the common fisheries policy , including the creation of a European Fisheries Fund . &quot;
paragraph 40 states : &apos; &#91; Parliament &#93; believes that the Commission should draw up , as a matter of urgency , an appropriate communication and campaign strategy which presents the new Constitution to Europe &apos;s citizens in as clear , fair and understandable a way as possible . &quot;
we would note that there are various views of what an &apos; appropriate strategy &quot; is in this context .
in view of the above , we definitely cannot vote in favour of this motion for a resolution .
.
I voted in favour of the compromise motion for a resolution on the Commission &apos;s political orientations and wish to highlight in particular the pact on the economic , social and territorial cohesion policies .
as I have said on many occasions , I feel that cohesion policy is a guiding principle and the very backbone of the entire EU , without which the EU would lose its raison d &quot; être .
without cohesion policies , the EU would be no more than a &apos; hyper @-@ market , &quot; an instrument of subordination to the big and the dominant , in all fields .
as one of the EU &apos;s founding principles , the principle of cohesion is , moreover , a fundamentally Christian @-@ Democratic concept .
the Left is welcome to join us in this interpretation , but we must not leave it to the Left to advocate and defend principles that are ours .
in other words , we must develop competitiveness , but without damaging cohesion ; rather , we must make cohesion stronger .
Mr President , as a substitute member of the Delegation to EU @-@ Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee , I want to congratulate Mr Van Orden on his report and to note the very positive progress Bulgaria has made towards membership of the European Union .
we hope they will be members in a few years &apos; time .
I want to enter one caveat : there is still serious evidence about the lack of professionalism of the Bulgarian judiciary and of its lack of independence .
I would urge the Bulgarian Government to address those issues within the next year so that they can become members in 2007 .
, . as we have repeatedly pointed out , the intrinsic economic and political aims of the current enlargement are there for all to see , and once again expressed in the resolution voted on just now .
the resolution glosses over the fact that implementing neoliberal policies is a prerequisite for , and a backdrop to , EU accession , although it does mention the deified &apos; functioning market economy , &quot; which means capitalism and the domination and exploitation of an increasingly sizeable portion of that country &apos;s economy by the large financial and economic groups .
it also mentions &apos; direct foreign investment , &quot; which , to some people &apos;s delight , has reached &apos; record levels , &quot; which means even greater domination of the Bulgarian economy by the large financial groups .
applauding Bulgaria &apos;s efforts is at variance with the EU &apos;s much @-@ trumpeted aims .
economic and social cohesion cannot be built on the foundation of competition and the relocation of capital as a function of increasingly unbridled exploitation .
that activity , which leaves unemployment and poverty in its wake - as evidenced by company relocations in Portugal - does not create genuine wealth in the country concerned .
the resolution itself mentions that many people have not detected any improvement in their economic situation and that emigration continues .
.
in common with the Commission , and with the report before us , I feel that Bulgaria has made the necessary progress towards EU accession , both at economic and at judicial level , although it should be acknowledged , among other similarly important issues , that crime , corruption and the trafficking of human beings must be combated more effectively .
against this backdrop , and given that the ongoing reforms can be achieved in time , I am in favour of the idea of Bulgaria joining the EU , depending on &apos; own merits criteria , &quot; and therefore feel that the Accession Treaty must be concluded in 2005 so that accession can take place in January 2007 .
I therefore voted in favour .
Mr President , again I congratulate the rapporteur on his report and note with satisfaction the progress that Romania has made towards membership of the Community .
however , I enter a different caveat this time : the situation of orphans and young children .
the state of the homes in Romania is still unacceptable .
I would again ask the Romanian Government to address this before membership .
finally , Mr President , I thank you and your excellent staff for all the cooperation through the year , and wish you a Merry Christmas .
.
the report before us - following on from the previous ones - assesses progress from the perspective of the overwhelmingly neoliberal and capitalist nature of the enlargement process .
it offers us a fairly extensive presentation of the criteria to be met and of the progress already made .
it makes criticisms and offers praise in such a way that these countries end up viewing everything in terms of , and moving ever closer to , adopting and implementing a legal / institutional framework , the &apos; Community , &quot; which acts as the foundation of the EU &apos;s neoliberal model .
those who advocate this policy are so keen that they have no compunction about tabling proposals that clearly attempt to settle old scores with the history of the people &apos;s struggle , and so here comes , for the thousandth time , the tired old devotion to &apos; market economics , &quot; &apos; structural reforms &quot; within the framework of &apos; competition &quot; and &apos; market forces , &quot; &apos; implementing the process of privatisation &quot; and &apos; dismantling unviable businesses &quot; and &apos; creating an atmosphere that is conducive to business and to foreign investment . &quot;
these demands are constantly reiterated , albeit accompanied by hypocritical regret for their devastating impact on workers and the people .
. the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the Moscovici report , with explicit reference to the strict agreements that have been made on monitoring the progress of reforms and their application , particularly in terms of the political criteria : human rights , corruption and the independence of the judiciary .
the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not hesitate to call on the Commission to apply the safeguards defined in the pre @-@ accession strategy if Romania &apos;s progress gives cause to do so .
the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament reserves the right to adopt a different position in spring when it comes to the definitive decision on Romania &apos;s accession , for instance if it should emerge that Romania &apos;s new government has not kept its promises .
that could mean ending the link between the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria .
.
in February 2004 , Parliament adopted a report that expressed regret that , despite some progress , Romania still had not completely satisfied the Copenhagen criteria .
in the meantime , as we approach the end of this year , the consensus of opinion is that progress towards accession has been made , although it is recognised that there are still many areas in which this objective has yet to be met in full .
it therefore makes complete sense for us to seek to negotiate the terms of the Treaty in 2005 and that a safeguard clause be inserted in case Romania &apos;s accession has to be postponed until January 2008 , which does , indeed , appear probable .
consequently , I voted in favour of the report .
.
I should like Romania to be in a position to conclude negotiations as soon as possible , with a view to signing the EU Accession Treaty .
I welcome the rapporteur &apos;s recommendations and warnings .
it is important that the Romanian authorities and the Romanian people are aware of the potential stumbling blocks of the accession process .
let me point out , in particular , that safeguard clauses can be implemented in the event that Romania falls well short of meeting conditions and that accession can be postponed for one year if the is not being implemented and the Copenhagen political criteria are not being complied with .
I feel , however , that such warnings make no sense unless they serve to encourage good behaviour and good performance and never to set impossibly high thresholds .
I particularly agree with the rapporteur &apos;s idea that the Commission must create a permanent mechanism to closely monitor and assist Romania on this road and the Commission must , in my view , continue to provide Parliament with detailed information on how the country is progressing towards accession .
the adoption of this report is particularly timely , following the way in which the presidential elections were conducted in Romania last Sunday .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
I should like to welcome the delegation from the Assembly of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , chaired by Mr Zaid bin Al @-@ Muhsin Al @-@ Hussein .
the importance we attach to this visit , which is the first to the Chamber of the European Parliament since 1995 , should be emphasised .
this visit comes at a very significant moment , especially in view of the fact that Saudi Arabia will be holding its first local elections in February 2005 .
this visit constitutes a new stage in the deepening of relations between the Saudi people and the European Union .
Mr President , we are very pleased about the holding of local elections in Saudi Arabia , but very much deplore the lack of participation by women .
I declare the sitting resumed .
the Minutes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
just two brief points , Mr President , the first of which has to do with the vote on Turkey .
during the vote on Turkey - on the Eurlings report - I voted in favour of Mr Langen &apos;s Amendment No 16 .
that has not , however , been recorded ; perhaps the machine was not working .
I would ask you to correct that .
secondly , we voted yesterday on the EU @-@ Russia summit .
in so doing , we said that all sectors of Chechen society should be integrated into the peace process .
I have learned today that the family of President Maskhadov , whose election took place under OSCE supervision , has been abducted and interned by the Russian secret services .
they include his siblings , who are between 69 and 75 years of age .
I would ask that you have this information verified and , if it proves to be accurate , protest to the Russian authorities about this .
your comments have been noted , Mr Posselt .
if there are no further comments , the Minutes are approved .
the next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe .
Mr President , Zimbabwe is a land of tragedy and a land of tyranny .
it is a country rich in natural resources and rich in the resources of its people .
both are being devastated by the political tyranny of the Mugabe regime .
people are suffering from hunger and health problems as a result of food and medical aid being withheld from areas that are covered by the opposition parties .
some 9 million people , 75 % of the Zimbabwean population , are now said to be living below the poverty line , but the World Food Programme is only able to provide food for 1.6 million people this December .
that is the first reason why this is an urgency .
the second reason is that on 3 March there is supposed to be an election in Zimbabwe .
that election , on the present prospects , will be neither free nor fair .
it is not up to us to decide who the people of Zimbabwe should elect .
that is entirely for them , but they must be free to elect whomsoever they wish .
it is up to the neighbouring countries of Africa and to the African Union to make sure that international standards of democracy pertain throughout Africa and throughout the country of Zimbabwe .
it is up to the European Union to make sure that we support the monitoring of those elections , giving technical support and financial support , so that we can play our part in the international observer missions .
that is also why it is an urgency today .
the third reason is the intolerable attack on the liberty of Roy Bennett , one of their members of parliament , a man who has suffered , whose family has suffered and whose workers have suffered over the months .
Mr Bennett pushed a government minister because he was making racial remarks about Mr Bennett and his family .
he was then sent to prison , not by the courts , but by a vote in the parliament based on the political division .
I urge that the AU and the EU act today to bring a semblance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe .
Mr President , I have just returned from a private visit to Zimbabwe .
it is interesting to note that the situation on the ground does not appear desperate .
however , according to the statistics , the situation is probably worse in other parts of the country which I did not visit .
when debating such countries as Zimbabwe , where human rights are not even discussed because of fear of repression , we must consider the right attitude to take in order to try to influence the powers that be .
we know we are dealing with a regime that is not democratic , that has taken tried to use almost all its powers to take away the democratic and fundamental rights of part of its population .
on the other hand , we have seen recently that there is a silver lining .
the courts , for instance , are striving from a very difficult position to try to retain some form of impartiality .
sometimes I wonder whether a carrot @-@ and @-@ stick policy might be more appropriate and more fruitful than just passing motions of condemnation .
we may pass this motion but what effect will it have ?
very little , I think , with a regime like Mugabe &apos;s .
we must start to think in different terms if we are to be effective when dealing with a regime of this sort .
Mr President , political oppression in Zimbabwe casts a long shadow ; it is a cloud that lies over not only those living in Zimbabwe itself but also those who have left to seek asylum in Europe .
in my constituency in the north @-@ east of England , there are Zimbabweans who fear summary death if they are forced to return to their native land .
I hope that Member State governments like my own , which think it is safe for asylum @-@ seekers to be returned to Zimbabwe , will take note of the resolution tabled here this afternoon and revise their position .
the situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse , not better .
on 9 December 2004 , the Non @-@ Governmental Organisations Act came into force .
this Act bans foreign human rights organisations and gives the government powers to intervene in the operations of any NGO in Zimbabwe .
meanwhile , the quality of life for Zimbabweans has plummeted .
life expectancy is now 35 years .
Zimbabwe could be self @-@ sufficient in food , but last season it produced only a third of the maize it needs ; yet the Mugabe regime is interfering with the international distribution of food .
in the light of this deteriorating situation , it is high time to tighten up targeted sanctions against the regime .
a final point : as we have heard , next March Zimbabwe is due to hold a general election .
there are worrying indications that this election may not be held in free and fair conditions .
electoral legislation passed earlier this month did not meet international democratic standards .
good observation of the elections is going to be a vital part of ensuring that they are free and fair .
therefore I hope that we in Parliament , and the Council and the Commission , will provide the maximum possible support for election @-@ observer missions at all levels .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Zimbabwe has always experienced periods of complexity and profound division , whether under colonialism , at the time of Ian Smith &apos;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and the ensuing UN embargo , during the war of liberation from 1972 to 1978 and then , following independence , in the first democratic elections , which were won by ZANU under Robert Mugabe .
for me , though , as an East German , it is always striking how often leaders who take office full of lofty ideals then , so to speak , distance themselves from their own original goals and visions and take less and less account of the people &apos;s interests the longer they are in power .
Zimbabwe does , of course , even today have massive problems to contend with .
I believe that the only thing we can recommend to Zimbabweans today is to look around them and see how their neighbours have managed it - to look at what South Africa is doing , at what Namibia is doing , at how Angola and Mozambique are trying to establish a balance between the various vested interests in their countries .
if there is to be peace , there must be an attempt at mutual understanding , with the use of peaceful means and every interest , even the most diverse , taken into account .
Zimbabwe needs land reform , but there are other ways of going about it .
the European Union should not always be , as it were , making recommendations to all and sundry on the basis of our values .
very often , that goes wrong ; perhaps you all still recall the European Union &apos;s staunch support for Russia &apos;s President Yeltsin at a time when he was an alcoholic .
in this actual instance , we can be confident that the SADC will have influence and find opportunities , and that the African Union can act to move things forward .
I am convinced that we , if we support these countries in their efforts to influence Zimbabwe , will be very likely to be able to help the elections scheduled for March to be fair and democratic after all .
- Mr President , the Mugabe regime &apos;s strategy of forcing political opponents into line is continuing unabated .
for example , the Zimbabwean authorities have forced two newspapers expressing critical views to close in the past 18 months .
in addition , Mugabe &apos;s supporters have made , and continue to make , life as difficult as possible for the opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change .
undoubtedly with a view to the approaching parliamentary elections in March 2005 , the Mugabe regime is increasing the pressure on independent organisations , judging by the Non @-@ governmental Organisations Act adopted in Harare exactly a week ago .
in future , these shall no longer be permitted to receive any funding from abroad .
if a Zimbabwean civil liberties or human rights organisation has so much as one foreign employee on its staff , it is henceforth termed foreign .
pursuant to the new Act , foreign NGOs cannot be registered and will therefore be banned in the near future .
the aim of this new legislation is clear .
after all , numerous Zimbabwean civil liberties and human rights organisations rely on foreign donations .
it is obvious that the intention of the Zimbabwean Government is to silence them .
according to reports , the NGOs concerned are unwilling to submit to the Government &apos;s attempt to gag them .
that is an extremely courageous attitude .
the Council and the Commission will have their work cut out to advise and assist them in this .
. - Mr President , Mrs Grybauskaitė , ladies and gentlemen , Zimbabwe is unfortunately one of the topics that figure most regularly , most frequently , in these Thursday debates that we hold on pressing human rights problems .
this tells us two things : firstly , that the situation remains serious and , secondly , that the measures that we have adopted have not been working .
what we must first condemn is the destruction of a country by an appalling authoritarian regime .
as has been mentioned in this House , the poverty statistics are increasingly shocking ; Zimbabwe used to be a country that , if properly managed , could not only have fed its entire population , but could also have helped to solve the problems of hunger and need on the African continent and in other parts of the world .
the Mugabe regime , however , despite warnings from the EU and from further afield , continues to increase political oppression and we view the elections scheduled for March with great concern .
either the country undergoes a rapid transformation and offers even the slightest opportunity for debate or those elections will not be free and fair and one doubts whether it will even be worth observing them .
such is the case of Roy Bennette , of persecution perpetrated against Tsvangirai after his visit to this House , of the negative influence - and I wish to draw your attention to this - that the regime can have in the region , where regimes can choose to follow the path of democracy or to slip back into authoritarianism .
I was recently in Mozambique , for example , where elections have been taking place .
the count has yet to be completed .
we became aware , however , that during the election campaign Mozambican voters voted abroad and that opposition parties - those opposed to FRELIMO - were persecuted in Zimbabwe .
the conditions are in place , however .
Zimbabwe &apos;s destiny can decisively contribute towards consolidating the democracy that we hope for in the region , following the example of South Africa , thereby consolidating democratic aspirations in Mozambique and Angola .
it may , on the other hand , represent a step backwards into forms of authoritarianism .
I wish to point out that we have put increasing pressure on neighbouring countries and that we have developed dialogue with the African Union .
this demonstrates the important role that that organisation has to play in exerting its form of pressure on Mugabe &apos;s appalling regime .
. - Mr President , the Zimbabweans are a strong people , and Zimbabwe is a strong country .
following independence , it was also an economically promising country .
it is sad to see that around 60 % of the population is currently in financial crisis and frequently lives below the poverty line .
that clearly says something about the administration of the country and what has gradually gone wrong with it .
the sad thing is that Mugabe and the ZANU @-@ PF party , particularly Mugabe &apos;s inner circle , are the perpetrators .
there are many in the ZANU @-@ PF party , of course , who are very well aware of the need for outside help , of the need for the economy to develop in a different direction , if the country is to survive .
we know that neighbouring countries have produced many informal contacts and endeavours to achieve a solution , and I think that it is precisely with these that the opportunities for the European Union lie .
with the support of the African Union , the New Partnership for Africa &apos;s Development ( NEPAD ) , President Mbeki and all the other contacts , we must increase the pressure , because it is only via the African route and the European Union &apos;s connection with this that we stand a chance of achieving any kind of result .
there is no doubt that the March elections have largely fallen into and been shaped by the wrong hands already , and it will be very difficult to make them fair and open .
this renders observation close to pointless .
nevertheless , it is in that democratic process and in civil society that strength is to be found .
that strength is still great in Zimbabwe , still non @-@ violent and still oriented towards peace and democratic solutions .
I hope that , by using smart sanctions , by taking the path that we , the European Union , are taking , and in consultation with those other countries , we shall do our utmost to take that democratic step there .
the alternative path , bloodshed , offers no prospects .
I sincerely hope that we can use all our diplomatic means to increase the pressure to such a degree that Mugabe is surrounded by people who set the dominoes falling .
this is necessary if the democratic path is to stand a chance of success there .
indeed , it is my hope that Europe will make full use of all the means at its disposal to this end .
. - Mr President , a legacy of colonial Southern Rhodesia is that much of the Zimbabwean farmland is in the hands of a small group of farmers of European origin .
my group supports the wishes of the black majority of the population for the return of most of the land to them .
unfortunately , that wish is being seriously abused by Robert Mugabe , the man once popular as the leader of the successful war of liberation against the colonial occupiers and the racist minority Government of Ian Smith .
it was not until the electorate had almost lost its trust in him that he made the long @-@ promised land reform a priority .
for Mugabe , the expropriation of large farms is now principally an instrument to reward his old following of freedom fighters at last after decades of delay .
still more , it forms part of a campaign to eliminate political opponents by means of slurs , intimidation and coercion .
if Europe isolates this regime , it must do so not on the basis of old colonial interests and old colonial arrogance , but because we want to help every country in the world promote human rights and democracy .
that is what this is all about .
- Every nation has the right and responsibility to resolve its political problems and no @-@ one , let alone the European Union , Britain or the United States of America , has the credentials to intervene politically , economically or militarily either in Zimbabwe or in any other country .
it is precisely because the people of Zimbabwe managed , through huge , bloody battles , to gain their independence from Britain and because they are claiming their land , the richest part of which still belongs to foreigners - mainly Britons - as a result of colonialism , that a new plan of intervention is being prepared , the aim of which is to turn Zimbabwe into a modern colony .
on the pretext of any problems which exist , most of which are due to long @-@ term delays as a result of colonialism , the governments of Britain and other countries are bankrolling the opposition , the leader of which , it should be noted , is accused of the attempted murder of the elected president .
a network of so @-@ called &apos; non @-@ governmental organisations &apos; is being set up , most of which are front organisations which have nothing to do with the grass @-@ roots and social movement ; they are there to prepare the ground for intervention .
for the Communist Party of Greece , this motion is unacceptable ; even the accusation of arms trading by British agents has been withdrawn .
the sanctions must stop .
we need to support the people of Zimbabwe in their fight to maintain their independence from neo @-@ colonialism .
. Mr President , we in the Commission understand and take a very serious view of the preparations for the elections in March 2005 .
the Commission reiterates its attachment to the holding of free and fair elections in that country .
the recent introduction by the government of Zimbabwe of a set of electoral reforms which are currently under discussion in the Zimbabwean parliament is an important step .
it will have to be assessed whether this will lead to a genuine incorporation into domestic electoral legislation of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) principles and guidelines governing democratic elections , as unanimously agreed in the SADC Summit in Mauritius last August .
the Commission remains deeply concerned about the current political and human rights situation and the respect for fundamental freedoms which at this stage would hardly allow for free and fair elections .
a specific matter of concern is the approval by the Zimbabwean parliament , on 9 December , of the NGO Bill , which heavily restricts NGOs &apos; room for action and activities .
the Commission fully supports the proposed EU in Harare and other SADC capitals as well as the issuing of an EU declaration expressing concerns regarding the implications of the bill .
the Commission is also worried about the risk of politicisation of the distribution of food aid , mainly in the context of the upcoming parliamentary elections .
in the event of clear verification of partisan use , the Commission , together with its partners , including the WFP , may have to envisage suspending food aid operations .
after the March elections the Commission will reassess the situation .
any lifting or easing of EU measures against Zimbabwe cannot be justified at this stage .
the Commission is aware of the deliberate attempts by the Zimbabwean authorities to undermine the visa ban &apos;s credibility by multiplying their travels to Europe and has always advocated a strict application of the exemptions provided for in the Council common position of 19 February 2004 .
the Commission will continue to explore all avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and to pursue an enhanced political dialogue with neighbouring SADC countries , notably South Africa .
continued international pressure on Zimbabwe and especially regional peer pressure is necessary .
the vote will take place this afternoon , after the debates .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr President , comparisons can be drawn between Congo &apos;s present situation and that of Germany during the Thirty Years &quot; War - a large country in the middle of a continent broken up , with various groups allying themselves with an assortment of neighbouring powers , and decades without peace .
that is precisely what has been going on in Congo for decades , with people dying in their millions , vast stretches of land lying waste , and the economy crippled .
as was the case in the aftermath of the Thirty Years &quot; War , there will be no resolution unless - as happened with the religious groups then - the ethnic groups can be brought into a peace process that also involves all the neighbouring states .
that is why we see it as important that massive pressure should be brought to bear on the states bordering this country of great lakes , and especially on Rwanda , in order that it may bring stability once and for all and may be deterred from active intervention in Congo , which is already suffering so much .
we will not , however , succeed in that by words alone , and so Mr Langen and I have started to develop a holistic strategy which finally interlinks economic policy , foreign policy and development policy .
words alone will be no use to us in this situation ; Europe will be able to use its weight only if it makes simultaneous and strategic use of the economic , political and diplomatic options available to it and really gets actively involved in this peace process .
Commissioner , you might well ask yourself what the use is of having this debate on a Thursday afternoon in a Chamber that is not exactly full .
I can remember a time when this House debated how Lithuania could become more than a colony subject to Soviet oppression , and today we have a Lithuanian Commissioner in our midst .
of that I am glad , and I am sure that you are well able to handle this issue of peace and human rights in Congo .
Mr President , the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most lethal since the Second World War .
the International Rescue Committee reckons that 3.8 million people have now been killed and over a million of those are children .
apart from those killed , 3.4 million have been displaced .
Congolese and foreign military groups continue to use violence to conceal the plundering of gold , timber , ivory , tin and other natural resources .
meanwhile , the fragile and ineffectual transitional Congolese government stumbles from political stalemate to military crisis .
both the transitional government and its international partners have failed to deal with the root causes of the conflict .
natural resource exploitation has funded and fuelled the instability in the country and , indeed , has fuelled instability and violence in the Congo for over a hundred years .
what should have been a blessing to that country has turned out to be a source of deep sadness and regret and , indeed , a curse .
the Congo &apos;s natural wealth has been a source of private funding for military and political elites instead of benefiting the vast majority of the Congolese population .
our resolution rightly calls for a package of measures to tackle this situation .
we must take action to ensure respect for the arms embargo ; the UN Security Council must impose sanctions , travel restrictions , a ban on financial services , etcetera , on individuals who have participated in the pillaging of Congolese assets ; the EU and its Member States must act against companies involved in exploitation ; we need a peacekeeping force in the east of the country ; and action must be taken to disarm all illegally armed groups .
only if such measures are taken can we hold out any hope that the elections due next year will make any difference to the tragic situation in that country .
the problem in the Congo is neither ethnic nor racial .
it is about economics , and only if we tackle economics will we solve the problems .
Mr President , I speak in place of Mr Van Hecke , who has had to leave Strasbourg early as he is travelling to the Democratic Republic of the Congo tomorrow .
the current situation in eastern Congo shows that the Congolese peace process is still very fragile .
indeed , there have been reports of new exchanges of fire yesterday .
the ALDE Group warmly welcomed the initiative to draft an urgency resolution on the Congo .
ultimately , however , our group decided not to endorse the compromise resolution .
we feel that the compromise text fails to identify the core problem of the continuing instability in the region and of the difficult relationship between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbouring countries , especially Rwanda .
the issue is this : since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 a large group of extremist Hutus have been hiding in a remote area of the Congolese rainforest in the east of the Congo .
after all these years they have still not been disarmed .
the presence of these heavily armed militias is a constant threat to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to security in the entire Great Lakes region .
the massacre at the Burundian refugee camp of Gatumba last August was only one in a long series of provocative actions .
MONUC , the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Congo , was supposed to disarm and neutralise the rebels , but has failed to do so .
although MONUC &apos;s mandate has been strengthened and there are extra troops , they are poorly trained and there is a serious lack of information and technical assistance .
we feel that the joint resolution does not acknowledge that if Rwanda is crossing the border into the Congo to put an end to the activity of the armed gangs , it is happening in the context of MONUC having failed to do the disarming .
we would suggest that the European Union and the Member States need to get more actively involved in the DRC and the Great Lakes region , focusing very much on rapid disarmament of the rebel forces .
perhaps European troops could be used to strengthen the UN peacekeeping forces .
the troops from Pakistan , Nepal , Uruguay and other countries that are in the Congo at the moment simply do not have enough experience with military operations in sub @-@ Saharan Africa .
Europe has that experience .
we have to consider all the options in order to make disarmament happen .
it is by far the most important prerequisite to get the peace process back on track .
in summary , we feel that although the resolution has many points that we support , it is unbalanced .
so , with regret , I will abstain .
Mr President , my Group welcomes the opportunity to discuss the current situation in the DRC , but like others deeply regrets the need to come back to this .
in the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday , one of the things we agreed was that the European Union &apos;s common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention , paying special attention to long @-@ term conflict situations .
this is exactly what we have in the DRC where , as has already been pointed out , the desire to control natural resources plays an absolutely key role in the massive displacements of people and in the massive numbers of deaths .
we stress the need for an effective means of arms control and an effective disarmament programme to be put in place .
we would also endorse the call made for the UN to deal with those profiteering from the pillage of natural resources , not least through the freezing of bank accounts and actions against companies .
we feel perfectly able to do this in the case of what we believe to be terrorist organisations , but seem totally incapable of doing it with those who cause massive numbers of deaths elsewhere in the world .
we also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN Department of Peace @-@ Keeping Operations has set up a special investigative team to look at the cases of sexual abuse and exploitation perpetrated by some of its own members in the UN organising mission in the DRC , particularly in Bunia .
we know , since this Parliament has discussed it on many occasions , that rape is used as a means to demoralise opponents by demonstrating the people cannot even protect their own families .
this Parliament has recognised on many occasions that victims of rape , child victims of sex abuse , are particularly vulnerable .
so we consider it despicable that such crimes are also being committed by those sent to protect an already traumatised population .
we look for the perpetrators to be brought to justice , as well as those profiteering from the tragedy in the DRC .
. - Mr President , Mrs Grybauskaitė , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in the Great Lakes and in particular in the Democratic Republic of Congo , is an ulcer , a volcano in the heart of Africa that is , sadly , always liable to erupt .
following a conflict that , during its six years , claimed three million lives , but that continues to claim 31.000 lives every month , according to the International Rescue Committee , the signs are that the situation remains unstable and unfortunately extremely unpredictable .
the ACP @-@ EU joint parliamentary assembly recently met in The Hague .
our meeting opened , curiously , with the good news of the Dar @-@ es @-@ Salam Conference and of the commitment made there by all Heads of Government to end the conflict .
by Thursday , however , when we ended the meeting , our joint Chairman , Glenys Kinnock , had brought us the sad news that the Rwandan army had crossed the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo .
we must therefore be more effective in this area in order to stabilise the region .
Mr Posselt &apos;s comparison with the Thirty Years &quot; War was most apt and I hope that he is right , because if so the conflict will come to an end and those regions of the African continent will be as prosperous , stable and modern as Germany is today .
this is what we strive for .
the African continent must be stabilised in open and democratic societies .
what must we do in this House ?
we must acknowledge that we are not doing enough as regards the militias of the former government of Rwanda .
they are a source of instability and an excuse for permanent instability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and we must take stronger action to disarm them .
we must make it clear that any invasion is unacceptable and that respect for a country &apos;s borders is a principle that must be applied by all countries in the region .
we must complete the democratic transformation of the Democratic Republic of Congo and do what we can to stabilise the country ; the Congolese army must be reunified , for example .
we must strengthen the resources available to the United Nations &quot; mission in order to guarantee genuine peace and stability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and to succeed in creating conditions on the ground that do not take us backwards ; in other words , conditions that lead all sides to honour the 2003 peace agreements , that lead all sides to honour agreements undertaken in Tanzania on 20 November of this year and that lead all sides duly to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions .
. amongst the many examples of violation of human rights and democratic principles in Africa , the involvement of children in armed conflicts stands out as an extremely serious problem .
I wonder whether any debate , even one held in this House , can help to counter poverty in developing countries .
over 5 billion people in such countries live on one or two dollars a day , and a bloody children &apos;s war is being fought in Congo , where over 300.000 children are fighting in military interventions which have killed more than 3 million people in recent years .
does such destruction of childhood through enforced labour , recruitment to the armed forces and sexual exploitation not demonstrate lack of responsibility and failure on the part of the various humanitarian and international organisations ?
in order to take measures to prevent tragedies of this kind , it is necessary to begin by identifying their causes .
the most fundamental of these is the long @-@ term and wide @-@ ranging exploitation of developing countries by a number of world powers , including European countries .
the latter profit from such exploitation while the looted colonies are left even poorer .
Congo is devastated , having become the victim of exploiters for whom the country &apos;s abundant natural resources are more important than human lives .
I believe that a person &apos;s level of civilisation should be measured in terms of how responsible their attitude is to the weakest , and the same is true for those in power .
yet the weakest among us should not be provided with aid that is merely a sham , and takes the form of moral devastation , contraception and abortion .
much more is needed .
comprehensive care should be provided , and development facilitated .
in addition , malaria , tuberculosis and AIDS , which are prevalent in the country , should be treated , and family units helped to develop soundly .
I also believe that instead of sending armed forces and instructors to Iraq , we should take steps to ensure that peace finally prevails in Congo .
. Mr President , the European Commission shares the concerns of Parliament about the increasing tensions between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo and their consequences for the human rights situation in the region .
indeed , we are very concerned by the threats of Rwanda to use force against the territorial integrity of the Congo in order to neutralise the ex @-@ FAR and Interahamwe troops , and by the multiple reports of military operations by the Rwandan army in the eastern Congo .
the humanitarian crisis that these actions generate is an additional reason for our concern .
it is essential to the stability of the region that Rwanda withdraws without delay any forces it may have in the territory of the DRC , and refrain from any action or statement that contravenes international law .
the European Commission is deeply convinced that until the problem of the presence of ex @-@ FAR elements in the eastern DRC is definitively solved , it will undermine peace and security in the region , be a source of instability and a threat to civilian populations .
in this context , the European Commission is convinced that the local government should make use of existing mechanisms , including the Joint Verification Mechanism and the Tripartite Commission , to find a peaceful solution .
furthermore , the Congo should implement without delay its plan , established with the support of the United Nations Organisation &apos;s Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) , aimed at accelerating the disarmament and demobilisation of foreign armed groups .
it should also speed up the integration and the training of its national army in order to effectively disarm the ex @-@ FAR militias .
indeed , the establishment of peace and security in the region through bringing together the countries is our priority .
in this context , we see the resolution of the ex @-@ FAR issue as essential and inescapable .
the Community is actively supporting the Congolese authorities in the reconstruction of the country through development projects for an overall amount of EUR 0.5 billion .
the European Union is and remains the largest humanitarian aid donor in Congo and will continue its assistance .
thank you , Commissioner .
the vote will take place after the debates .
the debate is closed .
the next item is thedebate on six motions for resolutions on Bhopal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate we are discussing issues we do not usually touch upon .
the issues we generally debate are important , but they relate to financial perspectives , communications solutions and economic matters .
these are all extremely important issues , but they are not tragic .
the three items on the agenda for today &apos;s afternoon debate , and in particular the third item on Bhopal , concern one of the greatest tragedies to have occurred during the past few decades .
this item relates to a tragedy in which a gas explosion caused the immediate death of several tens of thousands of people .
the consequences of this explosion are unfortunately still being felt today .
the institutions and persons to be named shortly are responsible for this sad state of affairs .
the organisations which are to blame for what happened have admitted their guilt , as they have paid out compensation for the deaths of 15.248 people .
they have also paid out compensation to 554.895 individuals who have fallen ill or become disabled , whilst attempting to pay such compensation to as few people as possible .
broad estimates suggest that over 100.000 people have suffered as a result of the gas explosion in Bhopal 25 years ago , and millions are still suffering to this day due to environmental pollution .
what happened in the aftermath of the event ?
following an agreement and various court rulings , the guilty party , Union Carbide Corporation India , paid out USD 470 million in compensation .
this would appear to be no mean sum , but the victims of the explosion received less than 10 % of the money .
the rest went to the lawyers .
in passing , it is worth noting that even in Dickens &quot; tales of 150 years ago , in which he enjoyed describing predatory lawyers , there are no instances of a victim receiving virtually nothing .
the money vanished , because in addition to paying the lawyers &quot; fees , large amounts were allegedly used to pay off corrupt officials .
it is intolerable that everyone has made money from this tragedy except its victims .
we are witnesses to a conspiracy , and action must be taken to put things right .
this is the aim of the motion for a resolution we are to adopt today .
we must endeavour to reassess the damage , so that compensation is paid to those entitled to it .
we must ensure that bodies are appointed which can resolve this problem fairly .
Mr President , today we remember one of the worst industrial disasters in history .
as we have heard , in the dead of night on 2 December 1984 , a deadly 40 tonnes of known and unknown poisons leaked into the air .
the people of Bhopal tried to escape the poisonous cloud .
their efforts were , however , futile and nearly 4 000 people died instantaneously ; to date 25 000 innocent people have died .
these are the bare brutal facts and today the people of Bhopal are still suffering from this horrifying legacy .
that is why we cannot just remember , but must act as a community to help another .
we need to ask why after 20 years the pursuit of justice has been so difficult for the survivors .
we need to ask why the transnational corporation involved denies any continuing liability , either for the state of the Bhopal site or the victims &apos; health .
we need to ask why the site has not been cleaned of toxic waste and continues to pollute the water the surrounding communities rely on .
we need to know just how Dow Chemicals can close the door on what was one of the worst industrial disasters in this century .
we also need to ask why so many people are still awaiting adequate compensation .
I appreciate the issue of compensation is mired in endless arguments as to the calculations , but this is not a sufficient reason for the people of Bhopal to have to relive the experience day after day .
whilst I support the major part of the resolution and the sentiment behind it , I do not believe the proposed amendments add anything constructive to this resolution .
it is vital when we talk about disasters such as Bhopal that we do not descend into polemics and irrationality .
the allocation of blame is all too often misplaced and we often condemn all agents without establishing all the facts .
as chair of Parliament &apos;s South @-@ Asia SAARC delegation , I would urge you to keep all these matters in perspective , and the budget of each country is particularly relevant .
we must recognise the limitation of certain countries , which may not yet have developed the technologies or know @-@ how to deal with such disasters as quickly and as safely as we have come to expect in our own countries .
we must also attempt to see each angle of an issue such as the Bhopal disaster , and we should acknowledge the work that has already been done by the Indian Government and the Madhya Pradesh Government with regard to medical care , economic and social assistance , environmental clean @-@ up , and finally financial compensation .
this short list goes to prove that a lot of work has already been done .
I feel it would be unproductive to vilify a government that has made efforts to remedy and address the plethora of problems stemming from Bhopal .
rather , we need to employ all our diplomatic efforts to keep the pressure on the Indian Government to maintain its current efforts in providing compensation and working on detoxification of the area .
nevertheless , if we demand that action is taken and money is spent , we should also be prepared to help in any way we can , including offering technical and financial support .
we must not condemn without first examining what we , as a community , can do to help .
we should continue to be constructive and offer the humanitarian , ecological and medical expertise we have to the Government of Madhya Pradesh .
this is a role for the Commission , Member States and governments alike .
I would urge you , therefore , to pressure all those who can bring any relief to those who have already suffered in Bhopal .
Mr President , while Dow Chemicals and the Indian Government argue over who is to blame for the Bhopal disaster , the people continue to suffer and die from their two @-@ decade legacy .
more than 7 000 people died within days , but inaction has seen 15 000 further deaths which could have been avoided .
even today , 20 years on , neither side seems to care about the suffering , only about their reputations .
as many as 100 000 people are suffering chronic and debilitating illnesses , with 10 to 15 people a month continuing to die .
the survivors still wait for justice : compensation and medical assistance in many cases .
the plant site , which continues to pollute , will cost an estimated GBP 15 million to decommission , compared with Dow &apos;s yearly sales of GBP 16 billion and India &apos;s GDP of GBP 320 billion .
the Indian Government has also yet to spend USD 330 million of the original compensation given to them by Union Carbide .
the pollution in the water supply in nearby slums is also 500 times above the maximum recommended WHO levels .
how can the international community , a multinational company and one of the world &apos;s main countries , stand by and watch this happen ?
just now it should not be about who is to blame , but who is going to stop the suffering .
Bhopal resident , Abdul Jabbar Khan , who runs the Bhopal Women Gas Victims &apos; Industrial Association , said in the Guardian newspaper in the UK : &apos; in New York after 9 / 11 there was compensation , punishment and clean @-@ up in just a few months .
in Bhopal , after 20 years , we have nothing . &apos;
- Mr President , since colonial times , the countries of the developing world have been supplying cheap products from the agricultural , mining and small @-@ scale craft sectors to rich countries .
they rely on the rich countries in the North for imports of expensive products based on new industrial technology .
that makes these countries extremely dependent on imports and exports and results in a trade balance very unfavourable to them .
just like the time when European countries exerted administrative power through military force , this distribution is still leading to permanent poverty and underdevelopment in the Developing World .
it is easy to see , then , why the governments of these countries thought that all new industries were to their advantage , in particular large @-@ scale metal and chemicals industries .
these countries had held little attraction for this kind of industry in the past , not only because the workforce was still insufficiently trained , but chiefly because most customers were in richer parts of the world and transporting finished products was expensive .
the only industry that took root originated from State @-@ owned enterprises or served only the local market and the tourists .
the need for stronger industry in these countries was and is abused by industries from the rich North because , although these industries want to expand , the southern countries are still not very important as markets whilst their purchasing power remains low .
investment in the South does become an attractive prospect for them , however , if wages are low and , in particular , if environmental and safety requirements there are less exacting or very poorly monitored .
this makes it possible for disasters in which many people suffer incurable illness or lose their lives to occur .
this danger threatens not only the employees of those enterprises but also the people living in the neighbourhood .
where disasters do happen , enterprises are not willing to bear the costs .
the gas explosion twenty years ago in Bhopal and the way in which this was dealt with have a great deal to do with this .
neither Union Carbide nor Dow Chemical nor the Indian Government are willing to produce sufficient compensation for the 20.000 or more people killed , for more than 100.000 people left with permanent injuries , or for cleaning up the contamination of soil and ground water .
a solution must be found , and disasters of this nature must never happen again .
let us Europeans take our responsibility , let us join in making payments if necessary , and most importantly let us lay down rules to ensure that this kind of error is not repeated by European enterprises .
Mr President , 20 years have passed since toxic gas escaped from a fertiliser plant in Bhopal . nonetheless , its harmful effects and environmental pollution are still affecting the lives of thousands of individuals .
this leak killed over 7.000 people during the night of 2 to 3 December 1984 .
a further 15.000 people died later as a result of it .
the leak is also responsible for chronic illnesses affecting more than 100.000 people .
the Indian Government and Union Carbide or Dow Chemical , the current owner of the fertiliser plant , have assumed responsibility for the impact of the accident on the lives of thousands of people and the environment .
as stated in the resolution the House is to vote on today , an independent investigation of the current situation in Bhopal must be carried out . this could be undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights .
experts must be involved .
they should visit India and consider the consequences of Union Carbide &apos;sactivities and the Bhopal disaster in terms of pollution of underground waters and the environment .
clearly , this also has consequences for human rights in the affected areas and communities .
in addition , the tragic case of Bhopal highlights the need to require companies to assume the same responsibilities as states in today &apos;s globalised world economy .
companies must be party to international agreements and conventions .
impact assessments need to be undertaken , both as regards respect for human rights and situations of armed conflict and tension .
this is the rationale underpinning the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
I appeal to honourable Members to study them carefully before deciding how to vote .
I should also like to take this opportunity to publicise the proposal made by the School of Peace Culture of the Autonomous University of Barcelona .
accordingly , I call on the House and the European Union to promote 3 December as an international day of corporate responsibility and human rights .
the aim is for companies to commit to the promotion and protection of human rights the world over .
this special date should be an opportunity for states , international bodies and civil society , amongst others , to reflect on their shared responsibility .
all international actors share the duty of creating a fairer and more sustainable world .
Mr President , if you go to Bhopal today - not 20 years ago , but today - you will see thousands of tonnes of toxic waste in piles , pools of mercury , skips of poisoned waste and bags of chemicals lying in the open air , seeping , whenever the rains come , into the puddles , streams and groundwater ; and you will see people suffering because they drink that water .
they suffer from pains in the stomach , headaches , anaemia and gynaecological problems because they have no alternative but to drink from those wells .
that is the problem we are facing in Bhopal today , and we are facing it 20 years after that catastrophe , when so many people died .
the figures range from 3.000 to 7 000 on one night ; 15 000 later on and 100 000 people still suffering from debilitating diseases .
we are talking about 15 years after the settlement which gave US $ 500 million to the Indian Government to disburse for compensation and rectification of that landscape .
it is still a picture of desolation and danger for those people .
we in this Parliament do not do well when we seek to be judge and jury in these cases .
that is why I cannot accept the Green amendments that have been referred to .
the motion itself stands well because it calls on the European Union to work with the Government of India to use the money that is available to make sure that there is a clean @-@ up of those sites , treatment of affected people and compensation to those affected ; and now , not in another 20 years .
that is our message to all those affected : to the European Union ; to the Indian Government ; by all means , to Dow Chemicals and its responsibilities and to the courts which will be looking at that .
but today we seek justice for those people and renovation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of its people .
. Mr President , I am glad to be able to speak immediately after Mr Bowis , who has impressed upon us where we have got to 20 years after 3 December 1984 , when gas from a 35 @-@ tonne cocktail of highly toxic substances caused 7.000 people to die when their hearts and lungs failed .
to this day , some 25.000 have gone down in history as the victims of the biggest chemical accident ever recorded , and some 500.000 are still crippled as a consequence of it .
what , though , was done for the victims ?
research has shown that , 15 years ago , compensation to the tune of USD 470 million was agreed on by Union Carbide and the Indian Government .
so far , the 100.000 officially registered as victims have received USD 300 each .
there are 2.500 houses for widows along with seven hospitals , and many facilities have been built , but what has happened to the rest of the money , some USD 400 million ?
I have to tell Mrs Gill that we really do have to ask who is to blame for that .
the ground is still contaminated .
the ground water is heavily contaminated with mercury , and that is not going to go away .
toxic residues are stored in the open air .
small wonder , then , that we end up with the situation that Mr Bowis has described , with chronic illnesses , brain damage , and children born with deformities .
if there is to be any substantial improvement in medical provision for the victims , then the Indian Prime Minister , Mr Singh , will have to intervene , and the government should comply with the Supreme Court &apos;s ruling and finally release the funds and enable full compensation to be paid out .
many chemical companies still have production operations in India and in other parts of the world where labour and environmental standards are far below those that apply in the European Union or the USA .
as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs &quot; rapporteur on the REACH programme , I can do no other than reiterate the demand made in the working paper : if there is to be comparability , we need rules made by the European Union , and , in the same way , rules laid down as standards by the WTO .
those whose desire for increased profits leads them to allow the minimum environmental requirements without exception are accepting the likelihood of a second Bhopal one day , and that is something that none of us can afford .
. - Mr President , it has been twenty years since the tragedy in Bhopal in India , with its huge humanitarian and ecological consequences , and I believe that the initiative by the political groups for the adoption of a motion in plenary by the European Parliament is particularly important .
however , it is not enough to jog the memory , it is not enough to condemn what is often the unaccountable operation of multinational companies in developing countries , it is not enough just to state our humanitarian awareness in words .
this sort of tragedy may be experienced again by people in some other part of the world if the international community does not move to introduce international mechanisms for controlling the operation of multinational companies , for protecting the environment and for protecting human rights and the rights of workers .
this is where the role of the European Union within the framework of the UN and within the framework of other international organisations may be more efficient .
the motion records the problems which still exist and numerous honourable members spoke about them in the area of Bhopal as a whole .
however , in my opinion , it does not fully reflect the efforts made by the federal and regional authorities in India over recent years in the fields of medical , economic , social and environmental restitution .
important policies have been implemented which we should not overlook .
to close , I consider that the best way for us to express our sympathy with the victims and their families is for the European Commission to take initiatives in cooperation with the World Health Organisation on the implementation of medical and environmental restitution programmes .
- Mr President , Mrs Grybauskaitė , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mrs Grybauskaitė on her assumption of office , and to wish her the best of luck .
as Ernest Hemingway once said , &apos; never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee . &quot;
it is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is concerning itself with regions of the world that are far removed from Europe , and that it is doing so without regard to the requirements of political interest .
on the one hand , the European Union has declared a strategic partnership with India , and yet on the other hand , Parliament &apos;s resolution states that the Indian Government has done little to protect people from the effects of the Bhopal disaster .
we are discussing the negligence of the Indian authorities , and rightly so , yet we should also make known our views on the liability of the US company that imposed savage nineteenth @-@ century capitalism and failed to observe any of the safety requirements that were mandatory in the USA .
the figures are as follows ; 7.000 deaths in the immediate aftermath of the disaster , and up to 30.000 deaths over the 20 years which followed , with over 100.000 having fallen ill to date .
obviously these statistics cannot express the human suffering , and merely conceal the pain and tears .
Bhopal must act as a warning for governments to put in place rescue systems , and for them not to abandon people .
it must act as a warning for international companies to ensure that the desire to make a profit does not replace the desire to promote safety .
it must act as a warning for international structures and organisations to provide support to regions hit by disasters .
in conclusion , Mr President , it should also act as a warning for us to call to account those who have taken such assistance from us or from anyone else .
. Mr President , the Commission welcomes Parliament &apos;s initiative to launch an urgent debate on this issue .
it is an important opportunity for us to reflect on the way in which we can offer help to the victims and how to prevent that set of disasters from occurring in future .
let me assure Parliament that the Commission has been ready to support India in dealing with this tragedy and will do so in the future .
through our decentralised cooperation budget line , we have supported local non @-@ governmental organisations in Bhopal with rehabilitation and skills training for victims of the disaster , as well as giving support to women &apos;s self @-@ help groups .
through our Health and Family Welfare Programme , we have supported the Bhopal District Hospital , as well as patient welfare societies of district hospitals and community centres in the region .
special assistance was given to the Municipal Corporation of Bhopal for the preparation of an urban reproductive and child health plan .
in addition , the Commission has provided a grant of EUR 10 million for the funding of the Government of India &apos;s National Disaster Risk Management Programme .
at the recent EU @-@ India summit held in The Hague , India reconfirmed its interest in pursuing an environment dialogue with the European Union and proposed the organisation of an EU @-@ India environment forum .
this forum will be a first step in tackling the enormous environmental problems that threaten both India and the European Union .
let me finish by expressing our deepest sympathy for all the victims and our firm hope that such a catastrophe will never occur again .
thank you , Commissioner .
we shall now proceed to the vote on these draft resolutions .
the debate is closed .
Mr President , I simply wished to point out that there is a mistake in the voting list circulated to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
as regards the amendments on Bhopal , we voted against the first of these and in favour of the other three .
I should like to note that my card has still not been registered and is refusing to work .
I wished to vote in favour .
your comment has been noted .
Mr President , I would like to raise another point of order .
yesterday , we were voting until 2 p.m .
it has in fact always been the custom of this House to vote between noon and 1.30 p.m. , because we do of course have a lot of lunchtime commitments and we end up keeping our guests waiting .
I would therefore ask the Bureau to make it a rule - as it was in the previous legislative period - that voting ends at 1.30 p.m .
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish all those present in the Chamber a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year .
thank you for your comment , Mr Rübig .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned , and I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2005 .
the next item is the debate on the report ( A6 @-@ 0070 / 2004 ) by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 2004 / 2129 ( INI ) .
. Mr President , the enlargement of the European Union means we are having to upgrade from driving a minibus , capable of taking 15 passengers , to a full @-@ sized bus , capable of taking 25 , with some spare seats to take on new passengers in due course .
this larger bus needs a stronger motor if we are not to slow down , and one that enables us to cross the difficult hills that lie on our path .
if we are to have a stronger motor , we will also occasionally need stronger brakes - perhaps an emergency brake - and better safety features too , such as a safety belt on each seat .
since we are upgrading , we should also have more comfortable seats so that every passenger feels at home and comfortable in this bus .
also , while we are at it , why not have a geo @-@ satellite positioning system so we always know exactly where we are on the roadmap and can better plan the journeys we want to take together by the most efficient and comfortable route ?
that is why we need a new set of rules for the European Union : a new Constitution to replace the current constitutional order and the set of overlapping Treaties .
in concrete terms this means a set of improvements that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteurs have identified as falling into four main categories .
first , it means greater clarity as to what the Union is , how it works and functions .
under this heading one can identify a single Treaty instead of the several overlapping Treaties - a single , clearer document that spells out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences , what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for , and how it works , with fewer and clearer procedures .
this will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our Union is about .
we will get rid of the distinction between &apos; Union &apos; and &apos; Community &apos; , which nobody except lawyers understands , creating a single legal entity .
it makes it clear that we are not creating some huge monolithic monster - the mythology of the superstate that some people seem to fear .
it is clear that we are not creating a centralised Union .
second , it will provide for a more effective Union - a Union capable of deciding and acting with 25 Member States .
it will make for more qualified majority voting and more continuity in the chairmanship of the European Council .
there will be a single foreign minister to speak for the Union to the outside world , instead of the Commission speaking on some issues and the High Representative of the Council on others , which meant that third countries never knew whom they had to deal with .
those posts will be merged into a single position .
third , and most important in my view , it will provide more democracy and accountability in the Union .
under the Constitution , all legislation will be subject first to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments , and then the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level , such that both have to approve virtually every item of European legislation .
frankly , this makes the European Union the most democratic international structure , or supranational structure , that exists in the world .
compare the EU to the IMF , to the World Bank , to the WTO or to any other international structure : none of them have or will have this degree of parliamentary input and of parliamentary scrutiny .
we should be proud of the democracy that exists at the heart of this Union .
the Constitution will significantly reinforce that democracy by extending codecision , by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so @-@ called comitology system for delegated secondary legislation .
fourth , the Constitution introduces greater rights for citizens through the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has been incorporated into the Constitution .
this , of course , applies only in the field of competence of European Union law , but that is a significant field of competence , and all European legislation henceforth will have to comply with that Charter .
all of this has led us to conclude that the Constitution is , to quote the committee &apos;s report , a &apos; vast improvement &apos; .
it is a vast improvement on the current Treaties and on the current constitutional order .
it merits our support .
these improvements are due in no small part to the input of the European Parliament into the Convention and the IGC .
we can be proud of our results .
it is a compromise .
it is not a Utopian treaty .
all of us would have written it slightly differently had we had to write it ourselves , but as a compromise package it is a distinct improvement .
I am confident that tomorrow Parliament will endorse it by an overwhelming majority .
this Parliament , elected by citizens across the whole of Europe , with parties from left to right across the political spectrum , parties in government and parties in opposition , will send a powerful signal if it endorses the Constitution tomorrow by an overwhelming majority .
I am confident it will .
.
Mr President , when at the last plenary session of the last term in office I had the honour of speaking on behalf of my group at an event held by this House in homage to Monnet , Schuman and Spinelli , I wondered what the founding fathers , the visionaries of Europe , would have thought of the point in European integration we were at and what they would have thought of the European Constitution .
I believe - I said it then and I repeat it today - that they would not have believed that what was happening was real , because , leaving behind a Europe divided by fratricidal confrontations , this Constitution sanctions peace on our continent and , to use Mr Geremek &apos;s beautiful expression , this Constitution stitches the two Europes together .
we are moving on from a Europe desolated by totalitarian regimes to a Europe - and this is sanctioned by the Constitution - based on democratic systems in which fundamental rights are respected .
after a Europe of ration books , this Constitution sanctions a Europe of prosperity and material well @-@ being .
overcoming a Europe which had disappeared from the world , this Constitution sanctions a Europe of solidarity , as demonstrated by the enormous wave of solidarity which has arisen on our continent to deal with the effects of the other terrible wave that struck Asia .
this Constitution will have , and does have , instruments which will allow Europe to play a greater role in the world from now on .
I believe that the Constitution marks a point of no return and , just as , not so long ago , the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmony , which allowed us to move into the future , this European Constitution is going to allow all of us Europeans to move forward together within a project of common civilisation .
the value of the European Constitution is that it removes the ambiguities ; it is the first document to define what the European Union is , as a Union of States and citizens , and does not weaken the Member States , far from it , because the Union &apos;s competences are competences that come from the Member States , and it does not weaken national Constitutions , quite the contrary : it strengthens them , because the strength of the European Constitution stems from the strength of the national Constitutions .
with this Constitution , Europe is demonstrating that it is much more than a market ; it is a market as well , and that is important , but it is much more : it is a project of common civilisation based on our religious , cultural and humanist heritage .
this is acknowledged in the first sentence of the preamble , based on the values of freedom and human dignity , founded upon the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
it is also a Constitution that opts for a particular economic system : a capitalist system with a social dimension .
if we look at the history of Europe , we see that that was not so obvious fifty years ago .
today it is .
for all of these reasons , I believe , Mr President , that many of the flags that this Parliament has unfurled over recent years are today standing as proud as those we have behind us .
I joined this Parliament 13 years ago , when it was a consultative assembly ; today it no longer is .
I joined this Parliament when there was talk of the European Union &apos;s democratic deficit ; I believe that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic deficit , because this Constitution introduces more democracy , more efficiency , more clarity and more transparency , as my friend , Richard Corbett , has quite rightly pointed out .
Mr President , this work has been done by many people over many years .
I would like to acknowledge them today .
I would like to remind you of the names of Emilio Colombo , Marcelino Oreja , Fernand Herman , Giorgio Napolitano , Olivier Duhamel , Antonio Seguro , Dimitris Tsatsos , Antoinette Spaak , and so many people who , seated here in this Parliament , have defended what today is going to become a reality .
they have often been called utopians or dreamers ; well , today , these dreams , these utopias , are becoming reality .
we in this Parliament can feel very proud of the work we have done .
Mr President , eight years ago in this very Chamber , a young Member of Parliament defended the opinion on the Treaty of Amsterdam and said that it was not perfect , as we knew , but that it was not the final destination , and cited , as I am going to do again today , a Miguel de Cervantes disenchanted with life in his final days , who said that there were occasions when we had to choose whether to be a road or an inn .
that was a road , and that road has led us to where we are today and I believe that today , in this comfortable inn represented by the European Constitution , over the coming years we Europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace , freedom , justice and solidarity .
I would , therefore , be delighted if tomorrow this Parliament votes in favour of this document , and this is very important , since it ushers in a new era on our continent .
Mr Schmit has the floor on behalf of the Council , and I would like to thank him in particular for being here , and also express our condolences to him and the people of Luxembourg , who are in national mourning following the death of the Grand Duchess .
Mr President , I should like to thank you for these expressions of solidarity with the people of Luxembourg at a time of great sorrow .
I am very grateful indeed .
personally , this is the first time that I have had the honour of appearing before Parliament and it is therefore a great honour and a great pleasure to be able to speak in this House , on the Council &apos;s behalf , on a matter as important as the draft European Constitution .
I had the opportunity to work with some of you in the Convention and I feel that I can say that the work done in the Convention was historic , remarkable work that underlines the importance of the process that we are currently pursuing .
in this context , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
the message that you all wish to send out tomorrow by means of an overwhelming vote in Parliament is also intended for the citizens , because this Constitution is primarily a constitution for the citizens ; it is they who will derive the greatest benefit from it .
it has been said that this Constitution democratises our Union .
it strengthens citizens &quot; rights , through the Charter of Fundamental Rights ; it confers new rights on Europe &apos;s citizens , by giving them the opportunity to interact with the institutions and in particular the Commission .
this Treaty confirms that we are no longer an economic Union and that we are more than a political Union in the making ; we are , first and foremost , a Union based on common values .
in this respect , the Constitution is a crucial step in the integration process .
once Parliament has had its say , it will be the citizens &quot; turn to speak , either directly , through referendums , in countries where referendums are to be held , or indirectly , through parliamentary ratification .
the Council is committed to channelling all the necessary energies for this Constitution to be adopted in all Member States .
each Member State , each government and each parliament now has the responsibility to take us over this hurdle so that the Constitution can enter into force , and , I should add , on the scheduled date .
the European Parliament , national governments and national parliaments share a great responsibility in this respect .
we must work together if we are to meet this challenge .
. Mr President , the Constitution before us today would not have been possible without the European Parliament .
this House has played a crucial role in strengthening the foundations of our common enterprise , not least through the substantial contributions made by Members of this Parliament during the European Convention .
it would also not have been possible without that European Convention , which provided such a dynamic , open and innovative means of negotiation .
the involvement of the European Parliament in this unprecedented process culminates today with an excellent and well @-@ written report , which sends a clear message on the benefits of the Constitution and the need for its ratification .
I wholeheartedly congratulate Parliament , and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the two rapporteurs , Richard Corbett and Íñigo Méndez de Vigo .
the Commission fully supports your resolution .
we firmly believe that the Constitution allows the Union to make significant improvements .
in simple terms , for the first time the powers , competences , rights and duties of the Union are set out in a single Constitution .
the Constitution consolidates and simplifies half a century of treaty changes , allowing us to move from 12 basic treaty acts to a single text .
it makes the Union more open and simpler to understand .
the Constitution modernises the institutional structure .
it increases the powers of the European Parliament and provides for citizens actively to participate in the decision @-@ making process through a petition with one million signatures .
we will have more democracy .
the Constitution sets out , in 54 concise articles , the fundamental rights we will guarantee to our citizens .
for the first time the Union will accede to the European Convention on Human Rights , so there will be more rights for our citizens .
these three simple concepts - more rights , more democracy and more openness - explain why this Constitution should be ratified .
we would certainly have wished to be more ambitious in certain policy areas , but the final result is the best possible compromise in the current political situation .
I also accept that people have fears and criticisms regarding this Constitution .
it is not a perfect text and we should not hide from responding to these concerns .
our latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 68 % of our citizens support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution .
other opinion polls show that many feel they are inadequately informed about the content of the Constitution .
your report has made a good start by rejecting some of the misconceptions and scare stories about the Constitution .
it provides a range of good reasons for the Euro @-@ specialists to be voting yes , but these are not always the reasons that will persuade a single mother in Gdansk , or a shipyard worker in Spain to do so .
the ratification of the Constitution is an opportunity to debate the kind of Europe we want .
I welcome this opportunity to remind ourselves of what Europe has achieved and what Europe stands for , as has so elegantly been explained by others .
in the mid @-@ 1980s , the vision of creating a genuine single market seemed a bridge too far .
and yet it happened , bringing in its wake an economic dynamism from which we still benefit .
to cite one simple example , the fact that we do not have to go through customs at borders has dramatically reduced costs and delivery times .
in a single step we removed the need for 60 million VAT documents per year .
today , the younger generation treat as a right the idea of a zone of free movement , in the same way that they expect the Union to ensure a clean environment and cross @-@ border cooperation on public health .
today , in 12 countries of the EU , we have a piece of Europe in our pockets , with the euro being taken for granted across the Union and with new Member States joining the queue to introduce it .
finally , first through membership of Greece , Spain and Portugal and now with the 10 new Member States , we have helped guarantee and consolidate democracy and the rule of law across the whole continent .
we must now turn to the ratification of the Constitution .
while we respect our different constitutional roles in relation to the national ratification processes , we cannot tolerate the debate being confused by myths or misconceptions about the content of the Constitution .
all of us have a duty to make available clear and reliable information on what the Constitution does and the benefits it can bring .
in so doing we must compare the results of the Constitution with the current situation .
Lithuania and Hungary have already ratified the Constitution .
I would , in particular , like to pay tribute to Lithuania and the speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament , who is here in the Chamber today .
we must now start to show what concrete impact the Constitution can have on the daily lives of the people we represent .
indeed , there is no shortage of good examples in this respect .
as I said earlier , the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from a symbolic innovation .
citizens will have a catalogue of rights and principles whose respect by the public authorities - be they European or national - they will be entitled to invoke before the courts .
the possibility of concrete participation in the functioning of the Union is extended far beyond the election of the Members of the European Parliament .
the citizens &apos; initiative will , for the first time , make European citizens protagonists in the legislative process .
modernisation of the area of freedom , security and justice will allow the Union to respond to the growing demand for more effective European action in the fields of border controls , asylum and immigration .
the same is true for judicial and police cooperation .
the Constitution lays the foundations for a single area of liberties and guarantees .
the new provisions on public health will provide higher quality standards with regard to safety .
the Union will be able to intervene in a more effective way to prevent and fight cross @-@ border health threats such as avian flu or BSE .
today , we cannot avoid thinking about the tragic events in Southeast Asia .
the Union is already playing a key role in providing humanitarian aid and contributing to the political , economic and social reconstruction of that region .
the new provisions on civil protection , which entrust the Union with the task of promoting consistency in international civil protection work , will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the future .
we have , of course , already put in place a number of initiatives aimed at informing the public about the content of the Constitution .
the Commission has produced written and audio @-@ visual material , developed a website , promoted and financed information relays , and sponsored seminars and other public initiatives .
the European Council has supported our efforts , calling on the Member States to improve their capacity for communication about European issues in the context of the ratification of the Constitution .
it is now time to move up a gear .
I seize this occasion to call on you to examine the possibility of putting in place joint communication initiatives with us that can maximise the impact of our initiatives .
I refer , in particular , to the possibility of organising media events at both European and national level during a &apos; European week &apos; , around 9 May 2005 .
in the meantime the Commission will not refrain from developing other ideas that can assist the Member States in drawing up and implementing their national communication strategies .
I can also assure you that the Commissioners themselves will be active in the debate on the Constitution and the future of Europe .
securing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is the main concern for the Member States and for the European institutions .
however , while we do not intend to anticipate application of the Constitution , we must also devote some effort to ensuring a smooth entry into force of the Constitution once the ratification procedures have been successfully finalised .
that is why we need to open discussions on preparing for implementation of the current provisions .
the Commission has been engaged in this process from the start .
we are proud of the text of the Constitution and will do our utmost to ensure that it sees the light of day .
I remain committed to dialogue with the European Parliament .
our work will not stop today .
in fact it is only just starting .
I look forward to debating these issues in more detail with the Constitutional Affairs Committee and joining you on different platforms to present our case .
in conclusion , I return to my three simple concepts : more rights , more democracy and more openness .
this year we will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe .
setting aside all other provisions of the Constitution , these three concepts alone underline why countries have joined the European Union and why the Commission will defend this Constitution .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have come a long way , and those of us who were Members of the previous Parliament will be able to remember how , in this Chamber , we debated the Treaty of Nice .
at the time , many of us were unsatisfied with it , and we said that our stance on the Treaty of Nice would ultimately depend on what new method of reform we might have in the future and on what the efforts at reform added up to .
the result of that is in front of us today : the Treaty on a Constitution for the European Union .
unlike in December 2000 , when we discussed Nice in the absence of the Central European countries - Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , Poland , Czechoslovakia ( which is now the Czech Republic ) , Slovakia , Hungary , and Slovenia , not to mention Malta and Cyprus , none of whom had yet joined us , it is a particularly happy circumstance that today , the day when we are debating the Constitution , we have among us Members from these countries , particularly from those European countries that were once Communist .
I think that is a wonderful symbol of the future we share on the continent of Europe .
I would like to extend very warm thanks to Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo for the outstanding work they have done together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , and also to all those who assisted them in it .
today , I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Convention , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , for the work he did , which was sometimes on the receiving end of criticism , but if he had not done as he did , we would probably not have this Constitution today , and so Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing deserves our warmest gratitude today .
we are the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - and of the European Democrats .
there are 128 MEPs in the European People &apos;s Party , and the DE part of our group has 40 Members .
speaking for the PPE part of our group , I can assure you that we will be saying &apos; yes &quot; to this Constitution without reservations , while the European Democrats in our group are entitled to come up with their own positions .
a constitution needs values .
almost as crucial as the procedures are the values that bind us together , for if we have no awareness of values , we have no foundation on the basis of which we can take political action .
we rejoice that many of our values , which we see as Christian , have been included : human dignity , the dignity of older people , the worth of children too .
I think it particularly splendid that children get a mention in the Constitution , for without children , this continent has no future , that we have described our values and banned cloning , and that reference is made to our principles - the rule of law , democracy , subsidiarity and solidarity .
all these things give us cause to say &apos; yes . &quot;
today , though , I would not wish to deny that many of us would have welcomed a reference to God in the Constitution , because it affirms that our human capacities are not infinite .
we would also have been glad to see reference made to our Judaeo @-@ Christian heritage , for , at a time when dialogue with the world &apos;s cultures is so necessary - particularly with the Islamic world - I believe that it is important that we know where our own roots are , and that our cultural and religious development should be mentioned in the Constitution .
even though that is not in the Constitution , every Constitution is of course a compromise , and so we say &apos; yes &quot; to this Constitution , because it reflects our values .
it is also proper that a constitution should include a description of the constitutional structure of the European Union , and I think it is particularly successful in this , talking as it does in terms of national identity .
Europe is not a melting pot , nor is it meant to become a superstate ; on the contrary , it is in its diversity that Europe &apos;s wealth is to be found , beginning in our towns and communities , where people live , and in the regions .
our nation states have their own identities .
we have a Constitutional Treaty which declares that it is from the nation states that the Constitution originates .
it is through our own national citizenship that we are citizens of Europe , and hence freedom of organisation for local authorities is made explicit in the subsidiary structure of Europe .
I think that is quite a masterstroke .
Jean Monnet , the first Honorary Citizen of Europe , once said that nothing is possible without people , and that nothing lasts without institutions , and what he said is true to this day .
if we do not have values which underpin everything , and if these values are not ultimately expressed in institutions that embody them , then those values cannot be realised .
that is why it is right that we should follow Jean Monnet &apos;s directions and go down the road that leads to Europe as a community , and , my dear friends - I apologise for using an expression current in my own party , but , as we are talking about the Constitution today , we are somehow joined together as one , not that our differences should be obscured - neither now nor in the future must it be intergovernmentalism or cooperation between governments that shapes the European Union .
the Europe of the future must rather be founded upon the Community method , and upon the Community action of the European institutions .
what this means for us is that we need a strong European Parliament , one that is a symbol of democracy , that we should act as equals in all matters affecting European legislation , that we need a strong Commission , deriving its legitimacy from its election by the European Parliament and hence also from European elections , and that we have to have a Council of Ministers whose actions are transparent .
let me conclude by saying that much that is in the Constitution is in the nature of a programme and has yet to become reality .
an example of this is Article 750 , which states how we are to live as good neighbours alongside the peoples of Europe who have a European vocation - and right now it is Ukraine of which I am thinking .
another is foreign policy , an area in which we cannot , in future , allow ourselves to speak with two or three voices , but must act jointly .
that is why it is not Member States of the European Union , as such , that should be seeking to join the UN Security Council , but rather the European Union as a whole , if it wants to be a global actor for human rights and democracy .
it is the European Union as such that must be represented in the United Nations .
we have many tasks ahead of us .
I speak for my group when I say that I hope there will be broad support for this Constitution , not only here in this House , but also in all the Member States , because this Constitution is the means whereby we will get through the twenty @-@ first century as a Europe of freedom , democracy and peace .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this coming 27 January will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp at Auschwitz .
the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community a few years later was a direct consequence of what had happened during the Second World War .
the fathers and mothers of European cooperation could see with their own eyes that ultra @-@ nationalism , Fascism , and the division of our continent by Bolshevism , always resulted in oppression , in terror , and in the dignity of the individual being lost .
they could also see that what created peace , dignity and democracy was supranational action and integration at a supranational , European level .
it is worth adding that this was then achieved through the Coal and Steel Community gaining control of the weapons @-@ manufacturing industries .
what we saw happening in the 1990s , when the states that have now acceded took their present form , was , in principle , a triumph over Communist oppression in one part of Europe .
the European Union is a union that has managed to take the values described in our Charter of Fundamental Rights and use them as the basis of democratic integration and to overcome both the Fascism and the Communism of Europe &apos;s past .
the events of recent days , in which people have been powerless in the face of forces that no amount of technology has enabled them to confront , show how absolutely necessary it is for action to be taken at the supranational level , with no national borders standing in the way .
in the global village , the European Union is Europe &apos;s rational and modern response to the challenges of the twenty @-@ first century .
the Constitution we are now debating is the framework provided for it .
our group will be voting in favour of the Corbett / Méndez de Vigo report - out of profound conviction , and also out of the conviction that the values described in this constitution are civil values .
the splendid thing about them is that you can understand them as Christian values if you are a Christian .
you can understand them as your own values if you are a Jew or a Moslem or an unbeliever .
these values are universal and indivisible , and so they are valid for everyone .
that also makes it easy for us , despite the divisions that otherwise separate us , to join together in supporting this Constitution , but if we do that , it is our shared basis for a democratic and dignified future in a social community with social responsibility and economic prosperity .
in the knowledge @-@ based society of the future , this Union of ours must , at one and the same time - and the Constitution does indeed set this out in black and white - perform its social tasks and guarantee the protection of the individual and of every citizen from the dangers present in this divided world .
that is what this Constitution will be able to achieve , and we are largely agreed that we are willing and obliged to stand up for it and contend for it .
one thing alone is lacking , and , speaking for our group , I will spell out what it is .
for the European Parliament to commit itself and mobilise itself is not enough .
those who signed their names to this Constitution at the dignified ceremony in Rome , which all of us chairmen of groups were allowed to attend , Europe &apos;s Heads of State or Government and foreign ministers , must , in the same way as we do , appear before the peoples and declare that this is our Constitution and that we want it .
far from this being one individual matter to be left to the European Parliament or to the Commission , the statesmen and stateswomen of Europe must do their part and affirm this to be their work - not only the work of the European Parliament or of the Convention on their own .
it is those things too , but it is the work of all those who carry responsibility for Europe &apos;s future , and they must affirm , before the peoples of Europe , their support for it .
if they do that , this Constitution will enjoy majority support , with the support of the PPE Group and probably even of that Group &apos;s European Democrats .
. Mr President , Mr Poettering properly reminds us that when Parliament reacted to previous reforms of the Treaties , the resolutions adopted were peppered with regrets , criticisms and things that we deplore , plus demands for further reform .
this time , we are not obliged to do this because we ourselves have been prominently involved in the drafting of the reforms , both in the Convention and the IGC .
this report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo gets the story right and I am pleased to say that all Members of my Group who will be speaking today will be speaking in favour of this resolution .
thereafter we will be out campaigning for the entry into force inside the Member States where referenda are to be held , including in France - to oppose certain factions of the left - and in Britain , where we will be fighting to oppose the right .
the principal argument for this great reform is clearly that it strengthens the European Union .
it strengthens our capacity to act abroad and inside our Member States , making us prepared to stand on our own feet in world affairs , shaping Europe &apos;s response to globalisation politically .
the Constitution redefines the European Union .
it strikes a balance between states - the old and the new , the large and the small - between citizens and the authorities and , as Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing has said , between dream and reality .
it has created a fresh , large consensus behind the project of European integration .
a word to those such as the British Conservatives who carp on the sidelines : if you are for Europe , you should be for the Constitution .
Europe cannot be constructed without clear , liberal and social values , strong rules and robust parliamentary democracy .
Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels .
without the Constitution , things will not work properly and the quality of policy flowing from Brussels and Strasbourg will begin to decline .
future expansion will be out of the question and I cannot believe that is what the British Conservative Party really believes in .
but Europe cannot work either without strong leadership .
this Parliament must learn to fill some of the strategic space that the reforms begin to open up for us .
we have many new powers , including , importantly , the right to propose a reform - a reform in the future of the Constitution itself .
the Commission must assert itself quickly as the new arrangements for the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Service , the team presidency and especially the so @-@ called full @-@ time President of the European Council are put in place .
the prime ministers and presidents must coordinate their campaigns .
I am pleased to hear what Mr Schmit said on that .
they must shoulder their individual and collective responsibility to win these referendum campaigns by showing the voters why these reforms are for them and why this is truly the Constitution for Europe .
. - Mr President , a majority in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is in favour of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , because it sees it as an important step on the road leading to the political integration of our continent .
despite the Treaty &apos;s many shortcomings , there are no other alternatives in the current political and institutional context .
the proposed Constitution establishes the Union as a community based on fundamental rights , grounds European policies in a code of common values , defines clear and binding objectives , and expresses a commitment to uphold sustainability in the economic , social and environmental fields .
it includes social rights among traditional human rights , ties the Union &apos;s external actions to compliance with international law , simplifies procedures , clarifies competences , expands the scope of Community decisions , and increases transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the Union , as well as opportunities for its citizens to play a part .
the text has a good many gaps and pitfalls in it , and it is understandable that there should be growing disaffection towards the European project among many people , associations and movements politically close to us , in whose eyes the Union is not yet able to respond to their concerns or to be a political entity fully able to act for a better , less unfair world .
to deny this reality , as our fellow Members do in their report , is , in our view , inappropriate .
for us Greens , the European integration process cannot be considered complete with the adoption of the Constitution , partly because other countries and peoples , beyond the current 25 , are still finishing or starting out on their journey to join the Union .
in that respect too , unlike the rapporteurs , we believe that the Union &apos;s institutional system is still too confused and complicated and will not last much longer without further reform .
we therefore believe that any development and improvement of the future European Union will depend on ratification of this text .
it is a dangerous illusion to believe that rejecting this text would prepare the way for another , better or even ideal constitution .
on the contrary , throwing it out would leave us with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice , which are much less advanced in terms of both the values of their objectives and the institutional structure they propose .
if the Treaty were defeated , it would be an ideal opportunity for the Eurosceptics to point out that the people no longer want Europe , whereas we know very well that this is not the case .
it would also convince many governments that the Convention method - that timid , half @-@ hearted attempt to overthrow undemocratic , inefficient methods of reform like diplomatic talks and the power of veto - can lead nowhere .
we therefore have a double objective : to approve this Constitution so that we can quickly lay the foundations for its successor , by seeking to build a strong , stable alliance with those political , social , associative and economic forces that believe , as we do , that in order to achieve our aims of social justice , ecologically sustainable development and peace , we must not only win the elections again at a national level , but also make European democracy stronger and more complete .
to do that , we need to take back the initiative , and it is on that point , Mr President , that I believe it will be possible to rebuild a united front of all those who are today convinced of the inescapable need for European democracy but are divided in their evaluation of this text .
. - Mr President , the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo concentrates almost exclusively on a series of new provisions that are not in the current Treaties .
such provisions include replacing the rotating presidency with a more stable two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year presidency , creating the post of minister for foreign affairs , albeit without communitarising the common foreign and security policy , strengthening Parliament &apos;s powers , according national parliaments the right to call the Commission to account , where they feel it has overstepped its powers , and giving a million citizens the opportunity to propose that the Commission table a draft law on a particular matter .
if the text submitted for ratification by the citizens or by the parliaments were in fact limited to that type of provision , many members of my group - not all , but many of them , including me - would not be opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty .
we are in favour of Europe and in favour of anything that serves to enhance Europe &apos;s democracy and improve its functioning .
we should not be bracketed with the UK Independence Party .
we feel that there is a great need for Europe in this globalised world , but what guidelines and structures do we need for Europe ?
that is the question .
the first thing we need , in our view , is a set of guidelines and structures that enable us , at Union level , to control the financial markets , rather than be entirely at their mercy , as we are now .
this can be done , provided that it is agreed to make use of powerful levers such as the Central Bank and taxation of the capital of major public bodies ; to make laws aimed at holding companies accountable on social , environmental , democratic and ethical issues ; to channel funds thus released into major political priorities that are publicly debated , democratically established and regularly assessed .
Europe is therefore the appropriate level to meet challenges that a single country would nowadays have difficulty in tackling , due to globalisation .
it follows , for that very reason , that we need guidelines and structures whereby we can reverse the trend of maintaining the main decision @-@ making centres at a distance from the people , and whereby we can reclaim popular sovereignty and the power to make political choices , instead of submitting to the laws of the market , even if that means encouraging fatalism , that deadly enemy of democracy .
in other words , to achieve those objectives , Europe is also a relevant level , a level at which it is appropriate to promote the rights of workers , citizens , members of Parliament and the public authorities to access information and to take action , in order to reduce the arrogant power of those who tend to see themselves as modern day feudal lords .
indeed , if there is a role that we are amply entitled to expect Europe to take on in full , it is that of responsible player on the world stage , determined to use its influence to bring about the introduction of a fresh set of rules governing international relations .
let us consider the potentially salutary influence of , say , a European decision explicitly to ban all recourse to war as a means of solving the world &apos;s problems , so as to ensure that , from the Middle East to the Caucasus , the force of politics prevails over the politics of force .
think of the positive influence of a decision to conclude alliances between Europe and the countries of the south that will extend to include international financial and trade institutions , thereby tackling head @-@ on the murderous onslaught of economic war ; or of a decision to establish with the United States , of course , the will to forge - with that great nation and with others - the most ambitious partnership possible , yet within a framework of total political and strategic independence .
if you harbour such ambitions for Europe , then perhaps some of you could tell us why , in that case , you are opposed to this draft Constitution .
you are opposed to it precisely because this text takes up provisions accumulated in particular since the Maastricht Treaty , in order to perpetuate them , solemnly and for the long term ; provisions that constitute so many obstacles to even the partial implementation of such a European project .
I refer in particular to the key principles of the open market economy in which competition is free ; to the fact that the European Central Bank can no longer have liberal statutes or a liberal mission ; to the Commission &apos;s discretionary powers as regards competition or indeed the blatant subordination of all European security and defence policy to the policy formed within NATO .
new provisions are added to those old ones , thereby widening still further the gulf separating the concept of Europe that is being constructed from the one that I have just mentioned .
the draft Treaty thus contains an article which calls , in the fiery spirit of the multilateral agreement on investments , for the removal of restrictions on foreign direct investment and of other dangerously ambiguous articles relating to life patenting or indeed to cultural diversity .
in all of these fields , what we need is not a propaganda campaign that brooks no contradiction , but a frank , public , pluralist review of the experience of recent years which has led to a breakdown of trust between the citizens and the European institutions .
as for the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , it does not say a word about the part of the draft constitutional Treaty devoted to the policies and functioning of the Union , which in fact accounts for two thirds of the whole text .
we are therefore opposed to this report , just as we are opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty itself .
once again , however , I wish to make it clear that the &apos; no &quot; that many of us are saying is open to alternative suggestions .
it is a European &apos; no . &quot;
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is one word missing from this Constitution , and that word is &apos; sovereignty . &quot;
it has been replaced by the word &apos; identity , &quot; which is not at all the same thing .
in the four corners of the earth , as we well know , there are peoples who have strong identities and who rightly claim sovereignty , such as the Palestinians , the Iraqis and many others .
in Europe , there will now be peoples who , at a time when they are at risk of losing their identities with Turkey set to join the EU , will lose their sovereignty when the Constitution comes into force .
one word has disappeared , the word &apos; sovereignty , &quot; and another has appeared , the word &apos; law , &quot; European law , a word that is the very symbol of national democracies .
there is therefore going to be a European law , henceforth on a higher legal level than national laws , even constitutional laws .
our Constitution , therefore , for each of our peoples , will become the equivalent of the internal regulations of a region of Europe .
this European , supranational law will from now on be adopted by majority and not unanimously .
there is therefore no longer any opportunity for a particular people to voice its opposition , even if this is a matter of defending its vital interests .
thirdly , this supranational European law will be drawn up by a Brussels bureaucracy that has had the attributes of a State conferred on it .
that bureaucracy is becoming a full @-@ scale international player , with the right to conclude international agreements , with a minister for foreign affairs ; those words do not lie .
it will enjoy the transfer to its remit of the powers of a superstate - the capacity to draw up laws , to define public services and to address matters relating to immigration and borders .
at the same time - and this will be my last point - national democracies will be trampled underfoot .
national parliaments are having their capacity to make laws removed from them .
to compensate for this , they have been given the right to deliver opinions .
.
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for undertaking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very diverse institution and august body that this Parliament is .
however , in one sense the debate has moved on , because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty @-@ ratification process that takes place in the Member States .
it is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discussion and the final verdict on this Constitutional Treaty will be .
many times when we speak about the issues involved , in spite of our best efforts , some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed .
therefore , we are fighting the next argument rather than dealing with the current debate .
in addition , when you listen to some of the debate , it is like going back to the future , because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first treaties in the 1950s , and to the second and subsequent treaties in the 1970s and 1980s , are being rehashed .
people are saying that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away .
let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it .
as a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future , it is a very good document .
it ensures there will be proper respect and trust for the Member States and for their roles within it , in particular for the smaller Member States ; it clearly sets down in the doctrine of conferral who has the power to do what and where the lines of demarcation are drawn .
when the people who oppose this Treaty and have opposed other treaties say that this will override national law , this issue has already been decided .
back in the 1960s in the European Court of Justice , the primacy of European law over national law was brought into being .
however , the Treaty clearly defines that and narrows down that role , namely that it only operates for European law .
the European institutions and European lawmakers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law .
so let us have a real and honest debate .
let us move away from the lies , the fear and scaremongering that takes place .
some people will be justified in opposing this Treaty because of their political beliefs , ideologies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States .
but let us ensure that the debate is based on fact , truth and the written text and not on misconceptions .
Mr President , though this House , in self @-@ congratulatory euphoria , will embrace this Constitution , thankfully the ultimate decision rests with the Member States .
it is their votes that really matter .
what I despise most is the false pretence , particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom , that this Constitution is merely a tidying @-@ up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generations .
that is demonstrably false .
those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the Constitution &apos;s own most ardent and more honest proponents .
in the Constitutional Affairs Committee , I have observed at first hand the strategy and scheming of arch Europhiles .
they make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself , but a work in progress and they do nothing to conceal their ambition to have it , in their terms , strengthened at the first opportunity - without , of course , the troublesome obstacle of further national consultation .
their undisguised candour gives the lie to those who would deceive voters into thinking that this is a mere tidying @-@ up exercise : it is not .
the choice for the nation @-@ states is this : a choice between a Europe of cooperating sovereign nation @-@ states , or a Europe that is itself a superstate .
despite all the denials , this Constitution is a framework for superstatehood .
it declares its supremacy over national constitutions ; it proclaims the subservience of national law ; it appoints its own president and foreign minister .
it relegates national parliaments to mere consultative sounding boards ; it trades meaningful democracy for the pseudo @-@ democracy of this House ; it neuters the last defence of the nation @-@ state by increasingly supplanting the national veto with radically increased qualified majority voting ; and it provides an unbridled path to further integration by permitting amendment by heads of government rather than by the people .
anyone with pride in his or her own nation , who does not want to see it subsumed into a hideous conglomerate , will reject this tawdry Constitution .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what we have been given here is a Constitutional Treaty founded on the work of a Convention composed largely of parliamentarians , and , as it was they who made this breakthrough possible , the development of Europe is no longer in the hands of diplomats .
ninety per cent of the draft produced by the Convention then went through the Intergovernmental Conference , and I believe that it was this method , involving the peoples of Europe through their elected representatives , that was crucial in terms of the progress made .
not everything in this constitution is perfect , but I think the decisive thing is that it is better than what we have at present .
this Constitutional Treaty reinforces the citizens in their rights ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights will give them entitlements and safeguards .
it strengthens citizens &quot; rights because , in future , the election of the President of the Commission will be directly dependent on the votes of the European Parliament .
the public &apos;s hand is strengthened both by the referendum and by extending the rights of the European Parliament .
this Constitution has become more transparent , because it makes the allocation of powers and responsibilities clearer , thereby making procedures more readily comprehensible , and because the Council is , at least when taking decisions on lawmaking , required to meet in public .
the extension of majority decision @-@ making may well not be sufficient , but it is considerable , and it does make the European Union more efficient , something that is apparent in other areas , for example , in the removal of the pillars structure and the introduction of a single legal personality , and , in particular , in the substantial improvements made in the fields of foreign , security and defence policies .
our Europe is founded upon values .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which I regard as drawing to a high degree on the Christian conception of what humanity is , is - or so I believe - one of its wonders .
having been drafted by a previous Convention , the marvellous thing about it now is that so many peoples can take such a common basis of values as their guide and that those who make our laws in future must look to see that these values are adhered to - and this is legally binding rather than a matter of policy .
we want this Europe of ours to be a community , and that is what the Convention wanted .
now , as we move to make the Constitution work , we have to attach high priority to what the Convention wanted being retained , without it being altered by a technocratic approach to its implementation .
even now , we have a Foreign Service on which to practise , and we are constantly hearing of attempts already being made in the corridors of countries &quot; foreign ministries to contest the Commission &apos;s powers - and hence also those of the European Community and its Parliament - as a means towards establishing a new intergovernmental authority .
in the way it is represented abroad , too , the European Union is a Community , and we see this in its foreign relations , in development and in many other areas of activity , and this must not be changed by the technocratic way these are shared out in a foreign service .
here we have fought to secure substantial rights for the Commission , without whose consent nothing happens , and I would point out to it and to the Council that we will keep a very close eye on this .
the way in which Europe &apos;s powers and responsibilities are ordered makes clear that those powers and responsibilities are conferred by the Member States , and it is for this reason that all this talk of a superstate is complete nonsense .
the fact is that sovereignty continues to be vested in the Member States , and every competence not expressly defined as being European remains with them .
in this respect , this Constitution surpasses anything else we have had ; as the opponents of a superstate argue that Nice is worse , it is they who must surely be in favour of the Constitution .
that is the truth of the matter , and so I would ask Mr Allister and Mr de Villiers to take an open @-@ minded look at the way things are and not tell their voters and the public things that are not true .
this Europe seeks to pool sovereignty where we as individual states are too weak to go it alone .
what this means is that we do not want to take sovereignty away ; on the contrary , we want to reclaim it for our citizens where we cannot act otherwise .
now that the tsunami has struck , we can see that the nation @-@ states can no longer help on their own , because it is beyond us , and that is why our peoples need to be given additional strength through our standing together in order to have a chance of survival in this globalised world order .
that , after all , is the whole point of this European enterprise , whose traditional objective has been to make war in Europe impossible - an objective of which we must not lose sight .
at the same time , the citizens , states and peoples must retain their own identities .
in the future , too , I would like , as a German , to be able to get angry when we lose at football to the Dutch .
we want to retain our identity .
it is in diversity that our wealth is to be found .
that cannot mean , though , that we do not take joint action in situations in which our strength depends on our standing together .
we should see to it that the Constitution is successfully ratified .
domestic , day @-@ to @-@ day policy must not be allowed to decide how the Member States and their parties handle the ratification process ; what is , instead , decisive is the historic moment , in which it will become apparent where the statesmen are in the Member States , moving the process of ratification forward .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on their outstanding report .
this Constitution is indeed our baby , and even if it does have a few flaws , there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to it .
we want it to grow and flourish .
let me say , secondly , that the greatest challenge for the European Union is not Turkish membership in twenty years &quot; time , but the ratification of the European Constitution in two .
it is by that that history will judge us , and - let me say - not just the politicians , but also the peoples of Europe .
I have confidence in the peoples &quot; intelligence , and in that of their parliaments .
in two years &quot; time , the Constitution will be in place .
after all , what will happen if it is not ?
those who believe that the status quo under the Treaty of Nice will continue to prevail in Europe are hankering after an illusion .
Europe will not shake itself down into a core Europe and a fringe Europe , either ; on the contrary , without a European Constitution , the European Union will degenerate into a patchwork Europe , confusing the public at home and destroying Europe &apos;s credibility in the eyes of the world .
it would be criss @-@ crossed by the axes and alliances of what would claim to be strategic partnerships .
if the Constitution fails , we will revert to a Europe of plots and counter @-@ plots , the old Europe , and it is precisely that that we do not want .
the Constitution brings to an end twelve years of intermittent reform , which have taken us from Maastricht to Nice via Amsterdam and from 12 to 15 , and then to 25 , Member States .
now at last , Europe can again give its full attention to the political challenges of the twenty @-@ first century , which are enormous .
we do , though , have a new basis on which to do this .
the 25 different peoples , all of whom want to retain their identity - and will do so - who robbed and murdered each other , waged war on each other and laid each other waste for centuries ; these 25 peoples are now indissolubly uniting their political destinies .
no such thing has been done before in Europe &apos;s history or that of the world .
that is what makes our fight for this constitution so worthwhile .
let me say , fourthly , that European unification was , for fifty years , an inward @-@ looking affair , focussing on the accession and integration of new Member States .
from now on , it must look outwards .
Europe is not a world power , but it does have a world power &apos;s responsibility , and that responsibility we have to be able to live up to .
the twenty @-@ first century will present Europeans with immense challenges : globalised business and financial flows , international terrorism , climate change and the disasters associated with it , and the flow of migrants .
a new world order is coming into being - not in ten years &quot; time , but now !
economically speaking , Europe is - still - a global player .
politically speaking , we are in the regional league .
if we Europeans do not face up to these challenges now , we will be exiting the stage of world history - politically at first , and then - inevitably - economically .
that is not the Europe for us to leave to our children .
Europe &apos;s response to globalisation is the unity of its peoples .
that is our response to the challenges of the twenty @-@ first century .
let me conclude by saying that the Constitution provides two guiding lights for the European Union &apos;s actions in the future .
in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Constitution affirms that the EU exists not only to guarantee the freedoms of the market , but also so that the citizens may enjoy the freedoms to which they are entitled .
Article 3 of the Constitution commits the EU to working towards peace , security and the sustainable development of the earth , thus affirming that the Union bears responsibility for our planet rather than existing for its own sake .
freedom for humanity and responsibility for the world - from these grows the new Europe &apos;s identity .
. - Mr President , the American publicist Jeremy Rifkin recently wrote a book about the European Union and entitled it &apos; The European Dream . &quot;
I am grateful to the President for making it possible for Mr Rifkin to be with us this afternoon , and for giving us the opportunity to discuss with him the future of Europe and of the European ideal .
this book is a dazzling analysis of the achievements and innovations of fifty years of European unification , which are truly unique and to be found nowhere else in the world : direct elections in 25 countries to one parliament ; a court of law capable of handing down rulings for all citizens and all states ; one single currency in twelve countries , enabling us to defend our economic sovereignty at a time of globalisation ; and , now , a European constitution on the table before us .
this is something of which Europeans should be proud ; they really should take great pride in what has been achieved .
it is , however , glaringly apparent that such a euphoric analysis is the product of observation from outside Europe , for the European Union evokes astonishment and admiration from around the world : in Africa - having heard President Mbeki &apos;s speech to this House , we know what expectations are placed in Europe ; in Asia , where Europe is giving extraordinary help to deal with the present disaster ; and also in America , both North and South .
I sometimes wish there were less small @-@ mindedness , less fearfulness and less scepticism within the European Union .
rather than being afraid of the project of European unification , we should hold our heads high with pride .
we are a model , and a model secured by the European Constitution .
some of Europe &apos;s dreams have already come true .
we still have work to do on the others .
as has already been said , the founding fathers &quot; great dream was that , after a millennium of war , peace would at last be restored to the continent , and the EU is the greatest peace project in the world .
many peoples have longed for freedom and democracy .
let me say it again : the EU is the greatest peace project that there has ever been on this continent .
many of those around us find the EU very attractive and want to join it .
some dreams , though , have not come true in a time such as this , in which crime , terrorism and the challenges of globalisation are gnawing away at the European Social Model .
I believe we will be better able to make the dream of prosperity and security a reality with this Constitution than without it .
such are the big issues that have to be explained to people everywhere over the coming eighteen months , as ratification is debated in the twenty @-@ five countries .
the Europeans &quot; great dream , the long @-@ term goals of this European project and the values that underpin it : these are what we must communicate , and we must not allow ourselves to get lost in trivia or details .
one Member on my committee once said that we must not now count the individual trees , the 448 articles , and pick out one ; instead we must look at the whole wood , the project as a whole .
it is then that we come to the conclusion that this is a great leap forward , from a union of states to a union of citizens , from diplomatic Europe to a democratic Europe .
nothing is set in stone , and there will of course be more stages to European unification .
that is what we should be saying to all those who are not yet satisfied .
I want to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo for producing a really good report , which will prepare this House for dialogue with our partners in the national parliaments and the citizens of twenty @-@ five countries .
I am glad that the European Constitution owes much to this House , from Altiero Spinelli &apos;s &apos; Crocodile Club &quot; to the European Constitution Intergroup in the previous and present legislative periods , in which many Members have worked to achieve progress in this area .
we rejoice and are glad that this draft is now on the table .
we must now do everything possible to ensure that this draft becomes reality rather than existing only in black and white .
there have already been two drafts ; this third attempt at a European Constitution must see the light of day .
if , tomorrow , we vote for the Constitution by a large majority , everyone will go out and fight for it .
Europe &apos;s friends must not let this historic opportunity be taken out of their hands .
we must not leave the field to its opponents , who will lead their countries and peoples into isolation and down a political cul @-@ de @-@ sac .
.
Mr President , Parliament &apos;s Committee on Development expressed decisive support for the constitutional text , in the belief that it represents historic progress by establishing solidarity with those who need it most , development cooperation and responsibility in humanitarian assistance , wherever it is required , as defining characteristics of the European Union .
in the opinion of the Committee on Development , we call for mobilisation so that the Constitution can be ratified and can enter into force as soon as possible , and for that mobilisation to involve those institutions , NGOs and individuals in Europe who have made North @-@ South solidarity a fundamental cause within our political struggle and our social commitment .
let us remember , therefore , that the Constitution makes these values of solidarity and cooperation and humanitarian responsibility the European Union &apos;s distinguishing marks and that , accordingly , they must transcend all policies and guide all Community actions .
the Constitution also means that , in the future , the European Union will have the legal personality we have lacked and which will allow us to act as a Union on the international stage and particularly within the realm of the United Nations .
in this way , we will be making considerable progress with regard to representativeness , responsibility , efficiency and potential , which are particularly important in terms of the European Union &apos;s presence and work in the countries of the developing world and in the field of development cooperation .
let us not forget that the eradication of poverty in the world is explicitly laid down as one of the European Union &apos;s constitutional objectives .
we will end - though this is of particular relevance given the current circumstances in Southeast Asia - by stressing that the Constitution provides for the creation of a European body of volunteers for humanitarian actions , thereby demonstrating its considerable timeliness and capacity for anticipation .
. Mr President , in the area of trade policy , this Constitution puts the European Parliament in a much stronger position .
when , as was formerly the case , the European Parliament &apos;s democratic control did not extend to trade policy , that gave rise to constant criticism .
this House did not even have to be consulted when the autonomous trade legislation was adopted .
in future , necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation , so , in principle , Parliament will participate as an equal .
that is something in which we should take great satisfaction .
it is still , however , a source of anguish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the norm in the Council .
on this , the Convention was more advanced than the Intergovernmental Conference .
nevertheless , this Constitution makes for greater consistency in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the Uruguay round .
this Constitution puts the European Union on a better legal footing for conducting negotiations .
.
Mr President , for those of us who work to ensure that the Union &apos;s economic resources are well spent , this is a good day : all spending is going to be subject to greater democratic control by Parliament and the Council , and efficiency in spending is going to increase , because governability is being increased : we are replacing vetoes with democracy .
that means we are going to be able to spend better ; and if the resources the citizens contribute are better spent , we will have more authority to ask for more resources in order to implement the policies the citizens are demanding of the European Union .
it is , therefore , a great day , a day for being happy to say &apos; yes , &quot; at a time when , through this Constitution , we are bringing the European project to fruition after fifty years .
this Constitution brings much progress with it ; nevertheless , as our Group President , Mr Poettering , quite rightly said , it is lacking certain things .
we have been timid in terms of acknowledging our Christian roots , we have been timid in recognising the obvious .
we have just celebrated Christmas ; this Parliament will stop at Easter ; here in Strasbourg the most important building is not a building like this one , but a medieval building , a cathedral .
perhaps we have been victim to a degree of intolerant secularism , but Christmas , Easter and the Strasbourg Cathedral will still be there and there are many aspects we have been able to improve .
we must , therefore , say &apos; yes , &quot; because we believe in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolve the daily problems of the citizens .
we are going to do so in the best way : by spending better , controlling our spending better and having more democratic and effective policies .
our group and I personally say yes to the Constitution .
Mr President , there was a large majority of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who voted in favour of the new draft Constitution .
we did so not because we thought that the proposal was perfect in all respects .
indeed , we should like to see more decisions with qualified majority voting in the social area .
I myself should like to see opportunities exist for cross @-@ border union rights .
we voted in favour because this proposal in the social area is better than the current proposal .
we must not turn the best into the enemy of the good when we judge the new draft Constitution .
let me give a few examples of improvements .
firstly , the objective of full employment .
this is the first time we have this objective in any draft for the new Constitution .
secondly , the social clause in Part III , which obliges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence .
thirdly , the fundamental rights in the Charter of Citizens &quot; Rights , which also includes union rights .
fourthly , the strengthening of the social partners &quot; role through recognition of the significance of the social dialogue and trialogue .
fifthly , the emphasis upon the balance between employment policy and macroeconomic policy .
sixthly , the introduction of a legal basis for services of general economic interest .
seventhly , the fact that EU citizens are now able to take initiatives .
the new draft Constitution would make the EU more open , more efficient and more democratic .
for ourselves who defend the social model , it is quite easy to support the new draft Constitution because it includes a long list of improvements which will significantly improve the opportunities for developing the social model in the future .
. - Mr President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a position with regard to the Constitution , of which I shall highlight the following salient points : we welcome the fact that the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development is among the Union &apos;s objectives and that environmental integration and a high level of protection for human beings have been recognised .
it is a pity that the third part relating to the Union &apos;s policies and functioning does not tally with the principle of sustainable development , within the scope of the policies on agriculture , cohesion , transport and trade .
certain environmental measures - such as those relating to tax , town planning , quantitative water management and land use - could be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure , but instead are still adopted unanimously by the Council .
we welcome the adoption of measures aimed at attaining high standards of quality and safety of medicines and medical devices .
measures relating to surveillance and early warning systems in the fight against serious cross @-@ border health threats are also a step in the right direction .
such measures form part of the EU &apos;s shared powers and are therefore subject to the ordinary legislative procedure .
we welcome the introduction of a chapter on democratic life in the Union , and the principle whereby these positions must be taken as transparently as possible and in the manner that is closest to the citizens .
furthermore , we should like to highlight the importance of the Community institutions &quot; responsibility towards the public , and public access to the courts and other relevant organisations , not least in the field of the environment .
personally , Mr President , I feel that the next step is to discover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure ; how this Constitution , which has been created in a somewhat top @-@ down fashion , will be received and experienced from the bottom upwards ; and how the principle of equality between States and the Community method will be strictly guaranteed in practice .
only history will be able to tell us .
. Mr President , although Mr Leinen has enjoined us to consider the whole forest of the Constitution , and not just individual trees , I must , as spokesman for the Committee on Industry , give brief attention to the trees of industrial policy , some of which I might wish would grow better than the Constitution makes provision for .
some significant progress has , though , been made .
the example I would like to give is that of space policy , for which Europe now has additional powers ; it may well not sound either particularly everyday or convincing , but I am not talking about us competing with the Americans or the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else in sending our man - or woman - to the moon or to Mars .
rather , what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information afforded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the globe .
consider , then , the great disaster that we now have to deal with : we need better information and warning systems , and Europe has the technology to provide them .
consider the day @-@ to @-@ day problems and tasks in connection with information and navigation that our Galileo has to deal with , and , finally , let us give thought to security policy .
we cannot deploy our troops without the information they need being provided from space .
if we want a proper policy of military security around the world , then we also need a proper space policy , with an emphasis on civilian and peaceful use , and for that the Constitution provides additional possibilities .
for that reason , the Industry Committee , too , fully and wholeheartedly supports the European Constitution .
.
Mr President , it goes without saying that I must begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on their excellent report .
I have had the honour of being draftsman of the opinion for this report for the Committee on Regional Development and I would like to say that the debate on this issue has been very positive and intense , because , amongst other things , we must remember the essential role played by regional and local administrations in European integration .
and it is also essential to remember that the European Constitution recognises local and regional autonomy as an integral part of the national identity of the Member States .
this means that , amongst other things , the European Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the current borders of the States making up the current European Union .
today , however , on the subject of the Constitution and the regions , I would also like to condemn the fact that , in a region of Europe , a Spanish region , the Basque Country , the exclusive nationalist government of that Autonomous Community wants to implement a rupturist , secessionist and independentist plan , the Ibarretxe Plan , which is a direct attack on the Spanish Constitution and the European Constitution .
because Ibarretxe and his government , who call themselves democrats , have made a pact with the murderers of ETA and Batasuna to bring this plan into being ; they have made a pact with an organisation which is on the European Union &apos;s list of terrorist groups , Batasuna , and the Basque Nationalist Party has made a pact and an alliance with criminals , with murderers : in short , with the enemies of Europe .
at this point , I am convinced that this Constitution is also going to put an end to independentist , rupturist and secessionist proposals such as the Ibarretxe Plan and I am sure that the new Constitution will represent an insurmountable obstacle to this Ibarretxe Plan and to anybody who wants to dismember the European Union .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ever since the advent of the common agricultural policy nearly half a century ago , the European Parliament has been little more than a consultative body when it comes to the making of laws .
right up to now , the Council has been able to take decisions without reference to Parliament , and over half the European Union &apos;s Budget is disposed of without any democratic control .
this is something that the European Parliament , and the Committee on Agriculture in particular , have never accepted .
unofficially , we have found ways of delaying final votes as a means of forcing the Council into a sort of codecision .
we have also done sterling work on handling such crises as BSE , which means that our being conceded codecision in principle is something we have , to some extent , earned , and that is something we welcome .
it has to be clear to us , though , that a number of points remain to be rectified .
in one article in particular , the Council has reserved to itself the right to vote on quotas , prices and restrictions on quantity , without , this time , consulting Parliament at all .
we still , then , have much to do in the future .
we will still have to draw on our creative powers in order to exert our democratic influence in these matters and in getting it stated , in principle , that agricultural policy will be subject to codecision .
if it is , though , Parliament will be given more responsibility , and I hope that this House will continue , as before , to give the interests of agriculture and of rural areas the attention they deserve .
.
Mr President , Members of the Committee on Fisheries are well attuned to opinion in Europe &apos;s coastal and island communities .
that committee , in a near unanimous decision , endorsed my opinion on this Constitution .
the most important paragraph in that opinion , which will be retabled tomorrow for voting as Amendment No 13 on behalf of my Group , refers to exclusive competence .
it &apos; considers that within the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU , which are detailed in the Constitution , the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustified &apos; .
the common fisheries policy has not been one of the European Union &apos;s success stories .
decision @-@ making is too centralised , too inflexible and too remote from the communities that it affects .
to entrench the CFP effectively in primary constitutional law is a major step in the wrong direction and one that will - I believe - be an obstacle to the kind of major reforms demanded by the fishing communities that I am familiar with .
exclusive competence takes the CFP outwith the principle of subsidiarity , ensuring that regional advisory councils can never evolve into management bodies .
I hope that colleagues will support Amendment No 13 tomorrow and support the fishing communities , as the Fisheries Committee of this Parliament has done .
these communities strongly believe that exclusive competence is not only unnecessary but is indeed anomalous and unjustified .
. Mr President , I too would like to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs , particularly on the way in which they structured their report , in which there is little room for us on the Legal Affairs Committee to make further improvements , although what we have proposed has been incorporated , and for that I am very grateful .
we , in the Legal Affairs Committee , will , though , be dealing with the issues of special interest to us in an own @-@ initiative report , particularly the reform of legal instruments and of the lawmaking process , the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality , and the innovations in the justice system .
I believe that another issue that will demand our attention in the future is that of how we can guarantee coherence between parts I and III of the Constitution .
this opinion by the Legal Affairs Committee does of course concentrate on the rearrangement of the Union &apos;s instruments of action , of which there is at present a veritable plethora : the Convention counted 35 different types of them .
I would like to pay tribute to its Vice @-@ President , Giuliano Amato , who achieved great things as chairman of the Working Group on Simplification , something that all those present who were involved in that Working Group will be able to confirm .
they can all , in any case , take pride in their own contributions .
that much about this European Constitution is unique as has already been said ; I also contend that something else that is unique is the amount of simplification that this Constitution has enabled us to achieve and the amount of bureaucracy it has enabled us to do away with .
I am thinking only of the constitutional reform processes that are going on in Austria and Germany at the moment .
I also see this as proof that the EU is not the bureaucracy it is always depicted as being ; on the contrary it is very much an institution capable of reforming itself and has shown itself to be more so than not a few nation states .
our legislative instruments will in future be simple and readily distinguishable from administrative instruments - and , when the Constitution is in place , much else about our lives will be so much easier .
I also believe that , although these changes are less spectacular than some of what is going on in the institutions , they play a very important part in making the EU more democratic and bringing it closer to the people .
. - Mr President , I congratulate the Members who have drawn up this important report .
the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs found it a pleasure , a great pleasure , to approve the revised contents of the Constitutional Treaty , because several issues relating to the area of freedom , security and justice will at last be addressed in a new way in keeping with people &apos;s demands : clearly , when one talks of freedom one is talking of the most important thing in life for each one of us .
there remain , however , certain aspects - which I shall highlight - that the Civil Liberties Committee examined but which left us somewhat perplexed , although without detracting from our pleasure and hence our desire to have this report adopted unanimously by this Parliament .
nevertheless , the Civil Liberties Committee was very pleased to issue a favourable opinion and therefore , on behalf of the Civil Liberties Committee , I call on all Members to express their approval of the Constitutional Treaty tomorrow .
Mr President , the Laeken Declaration rightly called for the EU institutions to develop in a way which brought them closer to the people .
as the ratification process on the Constitution gathers pace , it must be said that those ambitions clearly have not been realised .
as a member of the Convention , I made great efforts to try to persuade my colleagues that the emerging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe &apos;s citizens .
I argued throughout that Europe did not need a constitution but a simplifying treaty .
that would have been enough to modernise the institutions and the workings of the Union .
I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative .
Prime Minister Blair agreed with me then ; now he embraces the Constitution as it has been drawn up .
there is nothing anti @-@ European in opposing the Constitution .
however , British Conservatives and other colleagues in the PPE @-@ DE Group think that it centralises more powers , makes the institutions more remote and reduces the powers of nation @-@ states .
Europe has missed an historic opportunity to modernise its workings to meet the demands of an enlarged and more diverse Union .
a simplifying treaty could have tackled the real issues : relative economic decline , fraud and waste , and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision @-@ making processes .
at a time when the generosity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the tsunami disaster is evident to all , it is inexplicable why this Parliament is committing a considerable sum of money to a programme of events and receptions in support of the European Constitution .
those funds would have been better directed to assisting in the disaster relief .
the Constitution is of such far @-@ reaching significance that its rejection in one or more of the Member States in the forthcoming referenda would render it void .
however , rather than being totally negative , we should regard that outcome - should it occur - as a fresh opportunity for us all to establish a modern Union that respects and celebrates its diversity and which is accountable by the people and from the people , rather than one which demands too much conformity .
we live in a very peculiar time in the history of the united Europe .
even though it is very difficult to divide the recent past into sections , we witnessed , organised and became part of such events that clearly allow us to draw the conclusion and declare that we have entered into a new era .
today , the united Europe consists of 25 Member States , and we know that expansion is still in progress .
the united Europe &apos;s new face shows more and more defined characteristics and in order to maintain and preserve these traits , we now have a Constitution , which is the topic of today &apos;s presentation .
the Constitution proves that the united Europe will be able to meet the legal requirements of the expansion as well .
this Constitution allows for more opportunities to make Europe become the Europe of its citizens .
the role of Parliament , whose Members are appointed by direct election , has grown , and we believe that the decisions made by the European Parliament and the national parliaments should and will be built upon each other .
thus , the range of norms that pertains to the whole of the Community may extend in the long run , especially in the area of social issues .
Hungary had already ratified the Constitution at the end of last year .
however , this document that is on the agenda today is very important to us as well .
there have been concerns that information has been suspiciously withheld .
I firmly believe that we do not withhold information and we do not have any secrets , we have nothing to hide .
it seems as if we have to force information on the European political systems and citizens of Europe .
it requires certain knowledge to be a European citizen and to be democratic .
in the so @-@ called Lisbon process , we need to be familiar with the norms of the Constitution , its social norms and also know that norms require more and more guarantees in order to build a social Europe , strengthen solidarity and secure social tolerance .
the Constitution is our basic law , but as many have said before , it is not a final document set in stone .
let me mention two areas that reflect our future challenges .
firstly , the challenge of a multicultural Europe .
what I mean by this is not the question of Islam , but the challenge that our Europe is religious and secular .
secondly , the question of minority issues .
during the ratification debate , the Hungarian parliament urged that minority rights should be strengthened in community legislation .
I believe that our common European citizenship is the key to overcoming discrimination and the insecurity of national identity .
let us take advantage of the opportunities provided by European citizenship !
Mr President , this part @-@ session of the European Parliament is of historic significance .
a motion for a resolution has been tabled on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , and this House , Europe &apos;s largest democratic institution , will send an important message to the nations and citizens of Europe by adopting it .
the resolution approves the Constitutional Treaty and calls for its ratification .
adoption of the resolution will be an opportunity for all those who believe that Europe needs a Constitution not only to gain information on the Treaty , but also to convince Europe &apos;s citizens that it should be adopted .
in addition , I believe it will also act as an appeal to the European Commission to become involved in convincing European citizens of the Treaty &apos;s merits .
the Constitutional Treaty has been the target of much criticism in my country , and it did not live up to all the expectations held of it .
I have no doubt that , as it stands , the Treaty makes it possible to strengthen the European Union .
firstly , both the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrined therein state unambiguously that respect for the dignity of the human being is the basis of our common values , thus confirming the significance of our Judaeo @-@ Christian heritage .
secondly , the Treaty strengthens the role of the Community institutions , notably Parliament , the European Commission and the Court of Justice .
thirdly , the Treaty extends citizens &quot; rights and creates a European public space .
fourthly , the Treaty strengthens the EU by creating the post of EU Foreign Minister , and it enables full continuity to be achieved by means of longer presidencies , without the EU being turned into a superstate .
fifthly , it strengthens the EU as a community of states , nations and citizens , based on common values and solidarity .
this is the kind of EU we need .
two new Member States , Lithuania and Hungary , have been the first to ratify the Constitutional Treaty .
I am sure that my country , Poland , in which the majority of citizens are in favour of adopting the Constitutional Treaty , will also demonstrate its unequivocal support for the Treaty during the referendum .
I believe this should be regarded as something significant and , in its own way , symbolic .
twenty @-@ five years ago , the Polish Solidarity movement removed the first stone from the Berlin Wall , and our German colleagues ought not to forget this .
fifteen years ago , the Round Table talks in Poland showed that it is possible to make the transition from a totalitarian system into freedom without any disruption to international peace .
this was the beginning of the unification process in Europe , and the Treaty represents a great opportunity for this united Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the destiny of Europe is at stake .
I believe that I know what that means ; my father survived the battle of Stalingrad ; my mother emerged from the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau .
are we not all , on this continent , the products of an endless succession of perpetrators and victims of ceaseless violence ?
that is why I insist that Europe is a promise - a promise made 60 years ago on the brink of the abyss that was Auschwitz , and in the ruins of Europe .
the promise was that nationalism would be overcome , that democracy and the rights to freedom would be unrestricted and that Europe would be united politically .
our actions must be measured against that .
this Constitution , which the vast majority of Greens will be endorsing , is a great step toward this promise being kept .
it is not the end ; the tasks have not been completed .
it is for that reason that we will be voting in favour of it , and of the report as well .
this Constitution lays the foundations of a European democracy .
it establishes the Union as a community of fundamental rights .
its policies are underpinned by a common code of all @-@ embracing values and objectives ; for the first time , it declares social rights to be human rights as traditionally understood .
it simplifies the Treaties , makes external actions subject to international law , makes the EU more effective and transparent , more democratically legitimate , and creates the possibility of its citizens sharing in its decision @-@ making .
indeed , it does create something that is a Europe of citizens rather than the Europe of state chanceries that once existed .
that is why we will be voting in favour of it , and that is why I am glad to see Mr Wurtz here to hear me say that I find his criticisms incomprehensible .
his amendment makes no reference to democracy , even though this Constitution is indispensable if Europe is to be democratic .
why does he not mention that ?
he claims that social progress is absent , yet this Constitution , for the first time in the 200 years &quot; history of human rights , acknowledges and enshrines social rights as human rights in the traditional sense of the word !
despite certain contradictions , we have , for the first time , incorporated full employment and the social market economy in the list of this Constitution &apos;s objectives and values .
it is not true to say that we have agreed to make Europe a military power .
the whole process is highly questionable .
the issue of our relationship with NATO is as yet unresolved , and , although none can surely say in what way Europe will emancipate itself , we have made our actions subject to international law and to the UN Charter , while also , and for the first time , making civil conflict prevention a task imposed by the Constitution .
you cannot make things so easy for yourself .
I am worried about the ratification process , but that is not what we have to get through .
when the president of the Lithuanian parliament was here , when our Hungarian colleagues spoke , these ratifications took place without any information campaign on the part of the governments and without any public debate .
is that how we want to win the Constitution ?
we will not do it that way !
we have at least nine referendums ahead of us , and please can the rapporteurs , whom I want to congratulate and thank , allow us to say that this report is completely uncritical .
that puts a question mark against the credibility of this House .
we are not the Intergovernmental Conference &apos;s court poets .
we are not here to sing the praises of a Constitution that is not without its defects .
we have not created a European social order .
European democracy is incomplete .
the shaping of a European peace framework still calls for great deeds to be done , and so I would have liked to see us not only vote by a large majority to adopt this Constitution , but also open up prospects for the continuation of the constitution @-@ making process .
we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance will make our contribution by setting in motion the first citizens &quot; initiative , which will demand a first amendment to the Constitution , completing democracy , peace and the social order in Europe .
Mr President , in defiance of the resolution passed by the majority of my party , the PDS , and of the majority in my group , I support this Constitution .
to their &apos; no &quot; I say &apos; no . &quot;
as a socialist and a convinced European , I cannot square rejection of the first European Constitution with my conscience .
it was through a democratic process that it came into being , and that is itself a first in the history of the European Union ; I myself played a part in that as a member of the Convention .
let me set out the reasons that have led me to this conclusion .
for centuries , the peoples of Europe have suffered from imperialistic wars and bitter animosities .
to these we are , as we must , putting an end .
on that the Constitution sets its seal .
defining the Union as a community of values , the Constitution enshrines a canon of values ranging from the respect for human dignity , which is the highest good , to justice and solidarity .
all these values I count as my own , and I want to do everything I can to see them , in their entirety , actually made real in society .
the Constitution reinforces the rights of citizens ; it makes the EU distinctly more democratic , above all , indeed , presenting new opportunities to create a social Europe .
the Constitution substantially advances European integration , making the European Union as a whole better prepared to face the future .
the Constitution is significantly better than the Treaty of Nice , by which the Union is at present held together in law .
my decision also has to do with the fact that the Left , during the course of the Convention , largely refrained from contributing any practical proposals of its own to the process , and with its failure to come up with any real alternatives to what it now rejects .
I find that unacceptable .
whilst I would like to see a peaceful , democratic and social European Union and to see Europe united , this goal will elude us unless we are prepared to make concessions to one another .
I am convinced that Europe will never come into being if the political families declare their own standards to be points beyond which they will not go .
my saying &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution does not , of course , mean that I wish to gloss over or ignore its defects , and I want to continue to contend for changes in the EU .
I will , of course , take up the cudgels against neoliberal policies , and I will also fight against all that tends to turn the European Union into a military power .
my particular concern is that we must prevent the European Union from degenerating into an image of the power projected from America , and from its being weakened in economic and social terms by rearmament .
Mr President , a blank cheque is a cheque on which the recipient writes the amount concerned .
a cheque of this kind can be issued in an emergency , if the signatory knows the recipient very well .
why , however , recommend to the electorate that it endorse an agreement that is to be given substance by leaders we cannot possibly know at present ?
we do not know whether the most important and most sensitive issues are to be decided unanimously or by qualified majority voting .
the future unelected prime ministers will themselves be able to determine how they will make decisions , instead of giving the electorate the last word .
nor do we know the content of important articles in which decisions are left to the Court of Justice .
in one place , a pledge is given on matters relating to countries &quot; social systems ; elsewhere , our welfare systems can be voted away on the basis of a majority decision or a judgment .
in one place , the status of the national church is maintained ; elsewhere , the precedence taken by the Danish Constitution in matters relating to the national church is removed .
in one place , national identity is guaranteed ; elsewhere , the Constitution has to give way if it is in conflict with a decision by officials in Brussels .
in Article III @-@ 375 , the Danish Supreme Court loses the right to decide the limits placed upon the EU authorities .
in many places , there is freedom of choice as to whether a binding decision or voluntary coordination is to be used .
thus , we do not know what we are supposed to endorse .
it is therefore wisest not to endorse anything until the amount is stated on the cheque , together with the identity of the recipient , and until we are also given the right to cancel the cheque .
in that way , we shall at least know what we are voting on and how we can overturn a decision .
constitutions are for states .
between states , agreements are made , that is to say treaties .
I want to see a Europe of democracies that solves practical problems by focusing upon cross @-@ border issues , or matters that we cannot solve ourselves .
in that way , we should not be losing anything in terms of democracy , but should have everything to gain in terms of cooperation .
we should then have a democratic bonus instead of a growing democratic deficit that might end up with the collapse of democracy .
as the well @-@ known poet Ebbe Kløverdal Reich pointed out , democracy without a is simply the exercise of power .
government that provides no opportunity for adjusting a country &apos;s course at the date of the next election is not democracy , but oligarchy .
Europe deserves better , and that is the title of the alternative statement that I recommend be adopted instead of Mr Corbett &apos;s and Mr Méndez De Vigo &apos;s report .
- Mr President , the Convention , in which this Parliament took part , drew up a text considered at the time to be the best possible compromise .
then the Council , in turn , reached the most workable compromise , and the new Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome .
depending on individual national constitutions , it is now a matter for the people , through referendums , or for the national parliaments to give final approval to the new path .
it is a path which , like it or not , regards Europe not as a federal superstate that has gradually eroded away identities , traditions and cultures , but as a Union of sovereign states that have freely chosen to breathe life into a common policy .
it comes at a time in human history when natural disasters and man @-@ made tragedies require that not just the economic interests of our countries be represented on the world stage , but also the values of democracy , freedom and respect for human dignity - values that our continent has secured and set out at last after centuries of war and conflict .
if today , in this Chamber , we divide over something that no longer depends on our decision , but on ratification by the individual Member States and individual peoples of the Union , it will mean disavowing our Parliament &apos;s ability to plan the future and relegating it to the role of a talking shop in which plenty of fine speeches are made but little is decided .
that stands in stark contrast to the increase in our prerogatives which , after a great struggle , we have finally achieved precisely through the drafting of the new Treaty .
it would seem appropriate to recall that , while the values and principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights now included in the second part of the Treaty form the ethical basis for the Union , several parts of the Constitutional Charter are still incomplete and will need updating in the light of current circumstances .
furthermore , we must ensure that the Constitution is not exploited for party @-@ political purposes against governments that have been duly elected by their own citizens .
the European Union must not run the risk of becoming a place where political groups join in battle to attack freely made national decisions on ideological grounds .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we hear it said that the EU needs this Constitution if it wants to deepen integration , but , as we have just heard from one of its most forthright advocates , not everything in the draft we are to vote on is ideal .
it is , apparently , better than what we had before , so this is progress in any case .
that actually sounds pretty feeble .
we are also told , though , that this Constitution will in no way facilitate the development of a European superstate ; on the contrary , it apparently strengthens the Member States in their identities .
if that is so , then the citizens of Europe &apos;s states should be given a real chance to have the last word in the debate on its ratification , if at all possible by means of referendums .
for that , though , they need real information rather than just the one @-@ sided propaganda celebrating the Constitution .
the Constitution &apos;s weaknesses , too , need to be discussed without accusations of anti @-@ Europeanism being thrown around : for example , the fact that smaller Member States will have fewer ways to defend their interests ; the fact that the European Parliament will continue to be a toothless tiger , particularly in matters affecting foreign and security policy ; and also the fact that Europe &apos;s workers are still exposed to the risk of wage and social dumping .
only a frank and open debate on this Constitution &apos;s flaws and dangers will make it possible for the peoples of Europe and the citizens of the EU to see it as something more than a Basic Law handed down from on high .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , what is at issue in today &apos;s debate on the European Constitutional Treaty ?
on the other hand , though , this treaty makes a multitude of improvements over against the treaties that we have at present , and that is the comparison in which the Constitutional Treaty must come out best .
it brings us more democracy , strengthens the European Parliament , and involves the national parliaments in the lawmaking process .
instead of weighted votes , there will be dual majority in the Council .
instead of more general clauses , powers will be specifically conferred .
the Commission is to be limited in size , which will help to make it more democratic , and the Constitutional Treaty makes for greater transparency , which of course makes it necessary to involve the national parliaments .
before we come to decide on something at first reading , the national parliaments will be given the chance to say something about it .
not only in that it makes for transparency do I regard that as something important .
the Council will have to hold its meetings in public .
we are at last taking leave of the clandestine diplomacy that has characterised Europe for over fifty years .
to sum up , what that means to me is that the European Union will be concentrating on the tasks it can perform , rather than becoming a superstate .
even if people still need to be more informed and more involved , this is still , on the whole , a respectable treaty .
I can speak for my own party , the CSU , but also for our colleagues in the CDU , when I say that we will vote in favour of this Constitutional Treaty without any reservations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the resolution on the European Constitutional Treaty has been written in a very positive spirit .
we seem to be commending a flawless piece of work , as if we were unaware of its weaknesses .
we should not , however , ignore the voices warning of the shortcomings of the present draft Constitution .
we may decide that , despite every effort , this Constitution is neither transparent nor comprehensible .
I am also struck by the fact that the motion for a resolution does not allow for much democratic discussion , thus branding those who have their reservations about the Treaty as anti @-@ European .
the European Constitution is a practical instrument that will affect European integration for decades to come .
Europe can set out on the road either towards a bureaucratic federalist superstate , or towards the political opposite , a liberal and competitive Europe .
let us make it quite clear that adopting or failing to adopt the European Constitution is a predominantly political matter , and not a prerequisite for integration .
it is therefore entirely legitimate to vote both for the Constitution and against it .
ratification is often portrayed as an essential step which should not be open to too much discussion .
advocates of the European Constitution sometimes even threaten that the Union will not allow itself to be held back by just a few countries not ratifying the Constitution , and that these countries will be marginalised and will have to content themselves with some lesser form of affiliation .
I consider this approach to be very unfair .
I have already repeatedly referred to the risk that democratic principles will be violated ; I grew up in a political system where a cheerful and happy &apos; yes &quot; vote was the only possible choice at every election .
I should now like to issue a warning against the use of these same principles .
I am not trying to target the Constitutional Treaty directly .
I simply wish to emphasise the need for open and democratic discussion , and to stress that a failure to adopt the Constitution is not a disaster , nor does it mean an end to the process of integration in Europe .
on the contrary , it might lead to more profound consideration as to where European integration is heading and where the voters would really like to see it .
thank you for your attention .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my support , on my own behalf and on behalf of the Spanish Socialists , for the Corbett @-@ Méndez de Vigo report , which marks the end of an historic process .
there have been two debates on the creation of constitutions in the European Union .
the first was the debate of the Congress of the European Movement in 1948 , in which Churchill , Reynaud , Ramadier , van Zeeland , Madariaga and Adenauer had the opportunity to begin debating a Constitution for Europe .
Mr President , please allow me to refer to my country , which will be the first to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution , with a public and open debate which we believe is important for everybody .
it is true to say that the Zapatero Government , after winning the elections of 14 March , unblocked the process of approving the Constitution , but I would like to say - and I cannot see any Member of the Spanish Peoples &quot; Party , and I would therefore ask the Vice @-@ President of their Group , Mrs Grossetête , to communicate this on my behalf - that the Convention began with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of Mr Aznar , and it was he who called for the referendum .
I therefore believe and hope that there will also be decisive support from the Spanish Peoples &quot; Party - the support of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats appears to be guaranteed - for the whole of this process .
I believe that in that way we will be able to ensure that we have a referendum which genuinely sets a positive precedent for the referendums in the other States which have decided to hold them and that there be a public and open debate .
I will end by saying that this concludes a process in which Europe has been constructed with passion and with good sense , and this has led it to change history .
Mr President , any position on the European Constitution must be based on a balance between what this Constitution says and what it does not say - something that is not perhaps properly underlined in the report we are voting on at this part @-@ session .
this leads me to say &apos; yes &apos; to this Constitution because of what it represents and because it means a new step forward on the way to a stronger and more efficient , more transparent , more democratic Europe .
with this Constitution , Europe will have a stronger voice in the world .
citizens will get better protection of their fundamental rights . their freedom and security will be better defended .
moreover , our values , including those which are behind our social and economic model , will be strongly proclaimed and protected to allow Europe &apos;s growth and , simultaneously , to protect Europe &apos;s social cohesion .
but that does not prevent me from acknowledging that the text reflects the unfortunate bias of some political majorities that existed in Europe at the time when it was drafted .
I particularly regret that it reflects a virtual Europe , a Europe that is not the real Europe , a Europe that does not exist in political terms , where everything that lies between individual citizens and states is just ignored .
peoples in Europe , regions , and their political role in the construction of a diverse and plural Europe have simply been neglected , have been passed over in silence in this text .
but this is just not the reality of the Europe we are all building here together .
what is worse , some languages , such as my own - Catalan - which are stronger than acknowledged officially at European Union level , are blindly ignored in this Constitution .
some of these problems can be solved outside the Constitution , and some of us will keep fighting for that .
I will therefore join those who support this positive step forward in the building of Europe and I will strongly recommend a &apos; yes &apos; in the Spanish referendum , although I will fully comprehend and respect any other position taking a different view of this balance .
I will not take this text as something engraved in stone , but as an improvement that allows us to keep working for a Europe where all citizens and peoples can feel comfortable , and are acknowledged as they really are and want to be .
Mr President , we European Greens are in favour of a &apos; yes &quot; vote in the coming referendum on the European Constitution in Spain .
we will have the great responsibility of holding the very first referendum on the continent , and a result expressing the Spanish citizens &quot; firm support for the Constitution will send a clear and strong message to the other European countries and will provide the impetus to carry on building the Europe we want to see after ratification .
our &apos; yes &quot; is a demanding &apos; yes . &quot;
on the other hand , we are concerned and confused by the position of the Spanish Peoples &quot; Party .
I would ask the question : what has happened to those people who said they wanted to die for Nice , such as Mr Aznar ?
I see that they are still alive and kicking and that they are currently creating confusion , double language and alarm in relation to the coming referendum in Spain , putting narrow @-@ minded party @-@ political interests above European integration .
this double language , together with an attitude of saying or doing little in relation to the Constitution , and confusing the people with other issues which have little to do with the Constitution , does very little to promote European integration .
some people are calling for a &apos; yes &quot; without any real conviction and sending confused and contradictory messages to their own voters , seeking only to erode the current government of Spain .
the demanding &apos; yes &quot; that we Greens advocate means choosing to take advantage of the new European political area constructively in favour of the social and ecological Europe we want .
the Constitution is not the end of the road , it is not the final destination , and is not even an inn .
we believe , like Antonio Machado , that the path is made by walking ; we believe that this Constitution is a step forward and we will continue along this road in the future .
Mr President , I must again point out the wisdom contained in the Norwegian Mountaineers &quot; Handbook . in the event of a discrepancy between the map and the terrain , follow the terrain .
otherwise , we end up in tragedy or farce , something we are well on the way towards .
this is due to the fact that , in crucial areas , the Constitution goes against the democratic intentions that are invoked and correspondingly deprives genuine democracy of vital sustenance .
the Constitution involves a huge concentration and centralisation of the EU elites &quot; political power , especially over the judiciary and police .
the EU Constitution constitutes a genuine abolition of living democracy in civil society , especially since the expansion of the EU &apos;s power makes real democratic control impossible .
the only hope in this process lies in the forthcoming referendums .
the EU elites are trying to abolish this ultimate democratic element too .
democracy is now so deeply compromised that it is openly practised as the power of the elite to govern the people .
the fight against the EU Constitution is a fight for democracy , and one that we intend to win outside this House .
Mr President , it is pretty clear that what we are involved in here is a one @-@ sided exercise in selling this Constitution to the peoples of Europe .
listening to some of the talk , you would think the Second Coming of the Lord was being debated .
starting this week , you will be spending large amounts of taxpayers &apos; money telling people what they should think and how they should vote .
I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order .
some weeks ago I revealed to this Parliament Commissioner Barrot &apos;s past and the affair was whitewashed .
now it has emerged that during his hearing , Siim Kallas , who is in charge of the anti @-@ fraud drive , gave deliberately misleading information and inaccurate dates , and used a misinterpretation as a means of shying away from a vital question .
yesterday afternoon , President Borrell denied me the chance to make a one @-@ minute speech to mention this to Parliament .
you will not win your constitutional battle by burying the truth and by failing to have a proper debate .
the whole process will fall yet further into disrepute , although , given the fact that I , along with many colleagues here , will be campaigning for a &apos; no &apos; vote , perhaps I should be grateful for the manner in which you conduct yourselves .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there have been times in the course of this debate when one might have been forgiven for thinking that no criticism of the Constitution had ever been voiced .
I believe that this will change when the Members of this House return to their countries and encounter diverse and varied criticism of the Constitution from a number of very different quarters .
the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , in common with many of the other political groups in this House , is divided on the issue of the Constitution .
the members of Law and Justice who constitute the Polish element in this group are opposed to it , not because it would be a bad thing for Poland , but because it would be a bad thing for Europe .
to begin with , the Treaty alters the system according to which votes are counted , to the disadvantage of countries with a particular interest in policies relating to Eastern Europe , cohesion and agriculture .
this applies to Poland in all three instances , of course , yet it is not the implications for Poland that are the most significant problem , but the weakening of whole sectors of European policy .
the Treaty strengthens the EU &apos;s powers over economic , employment and social policy within the Union .
it does not yet go so far as to grant exclusive competences , of course , and no decisive step has yet been taken .
nevertheless , it substantially strengthens the EU &apos;s powers .
yet it is not harmonisation of economic policy that Europe needs , but systems competition in this field .
harmonisation will consign Europe to the margins of global competition .
the Treaty is a significant step towards use of the Community method in the field of foreign policy .
again , no final decisions have yet been made , but a step has been taken in that direction .
it is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Community method and the inter @-@ state method in foreign policy , and Mr Rehn , the new Commissioner , admitted as much during his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
finally , the Treaty is based on false premises from its very first lines .
an example of such falsehood and extreme prejudice is the removal from the preamble of references to Christianity and God , whose presence is still felt in the majority of the European Union &apos;s Member States .
these are all reasons why today we must say &apos; no &quot; to the Treaty and &apos; no &quot; to this motion for a resolution in order to say &apos; yes &quot; to Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , not only is the draft Constitution far from being ideal , it is also far from being the compromise it could have been .
those in favour of a Constitution and a better European Constitution would do best to reject this draft , as I am in no doubt that a subsequent one would be an improvement .
the members of Self @-@ Defence will vote in favour of Amendment No 102 , an extremely important amendment by Mr Bonde to which I have put my own name .
the democratic deficit would be increased if national parliamentary competences were to be handed over not to the democratically elected European Parliament , but to the unelected European Commission , and this would be most undesirable .
it would also be undesirable to abandon the principle of &apos; one country , one Commissioner . &quot;
yet it would be a good idea to hand back to the nation states all matters which are not in actual fact of supra @-@ national importance , and more freedom and less centralism is a good principle to follow .
in conclusion , I should like to say that the members of Self @-@ Defence are open to the idea of an EU Constitution .
we do not reject it as such , but we cannot vote in favour of the motion for a resolution as it stands .
we have doubts , and these doubts are shared by millions of inhabitants of the EU &apos;s Member States .
yet we are open to dialogue , as this is what the millions of inhabitants of our countries want .
we will therefore abstain from voting in the final vote .
- Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , on their remarkable report .
I should also , however , like to thank Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , without whom , I am sure , we would not be here today debating this historic stage in Europe &apos;s development .
we are in a position to gauge how far we have come .
the greatest danger for Europe would be to fall back into intergovernmental methods .
indeed , we must deplore the fact that European governments have not followed all the proposals made by the Convention , the consequence of which is that we shall gradually have to adapt the Constitution as we go along .
in fact , what we need is more Europe in a globalised world confronted with terrorism , migratory flows , climate change and major economic disruption .
we need more Europe , more Union - a Union based on our universal values - and more democracy .
the Constitution will bring all of this , strengthening Parliament &apos;s role and involving national parliaments at the same time .
those rejecting this Constitution speak of Brussels bureaucracy , of a loss of national sovereignty and of a European superstate .
for want of arguments , they trot out the same backward @-@ looking slogans , which are today devoid of meaning because they bear no relation to reality .
this is typical of their inability to look to the future .
how else can we explain that all 25 of our governments agreed to adopt the Constitution ?
they certainly did not intend to commit .
because we must work collectively together in the service of the European citizen and for future generations , we say &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution for Europe .
Europeans must choose between insularity and paralysis , on the one hand , and openness and modernity , on the other .
the choice is simple - if we want a free and responsible Europe , we must ratify the Constitution for Europe .
- Mr President , as a French socialist and as a European socialist , I shall be voting tomorrow , with emotion and pride , in favour of the report by the two Members of this House .
I shall therefore turn my speech into a tribute - a tribute to Altiero Spinelli , who drew up the first European Constitution in this democratically @-@ elected House .
I never forget that he was a veteran of the young communists and I turn to my fellow socialists and say to them &apos; never forget where you have come from . &quot;
he was an old anti @-@ fascist militant , an old federalist , and I pay tribute to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14 February 1984 .
Mr Poettering voted in favour , Mr Hänsch voted in favour , Mr Wurtz voted against and Mr Vergès voted against .
they will do so again , loyal as they are .
if you re @-@ read the text on which we shall vote tomorrow , you will notice that it takes up a number of elements of that old text .
let me give you some examples .
Article 3 of the Spinelli report enshrines the principle of European citizenship ; Article 4 , respect for fundamental rights ; Article 6 , legal personality ; Article 9 , the Union &apos;s objective of full employment ; Article 34 speaks of European laws ; Article 44 mentions sanctions ; Article 82 of Part 4 , which is Part 3 today , speaks of ratification , and I could go on .
what I am trying to say is that tomorrow &apos;s vote forms part of the context of this long history , and that this Constitution has not simply fallen out of the sky ; it is part of a major historical movement .
the seam was first mined over 50 years ago and yielded the raw material of reconciliation .
the single currency , the euro , which is more than ten years old , was Germany &apos;s currency of reconciliation .
let us therefore view this Constitution as a hand proffered to the peoples who have joined us again , now that the dark night of totalitarianism is over .
- Mr President , current events demonstrate that we need Europe now more than ever .
we need Europe to protect us , and to initiate and drive forward an original social model .
we need Europe to generate growth , to coordinate our economic policies and to combat unemployment .
we need Europe to implement a genuine research and development policy , like the one pursued by the United States .
we need Europe to protect and preserve our environment and , finally , we need a Europe that carries weight in the world , with military and civil European defence , and a genuine foreign policy .
the world &apos;s balance depends on Europe &apos;s continued existence .
in order to address this enormous expectation we need more effective , more transparent and more democratic institutions .
we need institutions that move away from a way of working that is all too often intergovernmental , whereby decisions are always taken without the citizens ever being involved .
we need institutions that favour Community decision @-@ making , because this is the only truly democratic method of decision @-@ making .
we also need strong institutions , enabling us to move towards a more integrated Europe , despite the timidity of the Heads of State or Government .
this is why we support both this excellent and well @-@ written report and the draft Constitution .
even if it does not go as far as we would like , this Constitution is a symbolic and significant step towards a more unified , stronger and more democratic Europe .
we owe that to our citizens .
Mr President , for the Catalan Republican Left - the - and for the other parties in our European coalition - for example from the Basque country , Aragon and Andalusia - this is not a good Constitutional Treaty .
it does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement .
stateless nations will not have any recognition in this Treaty .
we would have accepted the Treaty if only it had included a small step forward - official @-@ language status for the Catalan language .
today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Members may not speak their mother tongue .
of this 2 % , the vast majority of us are Catalan speakers .
I am the fourth Catalan @-@ speaking Member - after President Borrell , Mr Guardans Cambó and Mr Hammerstein Mintz - to speak here this morning in a language other than our own -
we reject this constitutional Treaty because we want to be directly involved in Europe and want a stronger , more united and cohesive Europe , built on its own diversity ; just the opposite of a nation @-@ state built on the basis of the French model and against plurilingualism , diversity and plurinationality .
working nation @-@ states do not make a good basis for the construction of Europe .
Europe should be built on the basis of national diversity comprising stateless nations , nation @-@ states and constitutional regions , for the purpose of establishing a new European citizenship .
- Mr President , the primary duty of a parliament is to represent the people .
our duty in relation to the Constitutional Treaty should be , first of all , to measure the gap between the peoples of Europe and this Treaty : without the people there can be no Constitution .
to the democratic deficit in the drafting of the Treaty we can now add the lack of democracy in its adoption : if we cannot have a single referendum for all of Europe &apos;s citizens , we could at least have held a referendum on the same day in all the countries of the Union .
instead , however , everything is done haphazardly and people are just as divorced from the Treaty today as they were yesterday .
Europe is in danger of going the way of the titles of a famous trilogy by the great European intellectual Italo Calvino : from to to .
there are no people and there is no constitutional spirit in the Treaty ; it lacks any idea of its place in the world and in time .
that is all very serious , at a worrying time when war and terrorism have come to predominate in politics , when natural disasters like the one in South @-@ East Asia speak of the social injustice and the intolerable poverty of this world .
in a globalised world , Europe is in danger of declining : there is a feeling of malaise in Europe linked to its internal crisis of social cohesion , while instability has become the key social factor of our times .
this Treaty represents the abdication of politics in the face of all that : a silent Constitution .
in it , peace is a vague aspiration , not a repudiation of war .
in it , the rights of people , women and men , workers and migrants , are a variable dependent on a balanced budget and monetary stability .
democracy is an optional extra .
the Constitutional Treaty does not provide for rights , apart from those of the market ; it does not propose reforms ; it has no future ; but instead it keeps Europe stuck in its present crisis .
it is not just inadequate : it is the wrong direction altogether .
that is why the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is declaring itself against this Treaty and will be campaigning against it in every country .
we need to free ourselves of this encumbrance in order to build the Europe of the future .
Mr President , today , the European Parliament is debating a treaty that is , as regards its nature and content , a constitution , or at least that is what the rapporteurs tell us we are doing .
in the report , they take as their starting point the apparent opposition between the Council and Member States on the one hand and Parliament and the citizens on the other .
in doing so , they overlook the fact that the European institutions owe their existence to the voluntary transfer of powers by the Member States .
moreover , citizens continue to identify primarily with their own state .
a European identity that has been imposed from above , with its own symbolism , will not change this in any way .
the treaty endows the European Union with the characteristics of a state .
one unfortunate illustration of this is the Foreign Affairs Minister , a joint figurehead who has to cover up the lack of joint policy , and it is equally unfortunate that this person himself becomes an institution .
the rapporteurs have to recognise that the dual responsibility on the part of the Council and Commission creates confusion and sows the seeds of potential conflicts of loyalty .
I cannot describe this treaty as anything other than an impetuous leap in the dark .
- Mr President , as a Lithuanian I ought to be proud that my country &apos;s parliament was the first to ratify the European Constitution .
however , the majority of Lithuania &apos;s citizens have not seen , read or discussed it .
it was not even debated by Lithuania &apos;s Parliament .
on the other hand I am sure that for the most part this Constitution is in keeping with the interests of my nation and state .
however , I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to Part 1 Article 8 of the Constitution , which lays down that the word euro - the name of the common currency of the European Union - must be used in the same way in all European Union languages .
it goes against the fundamental principle of the Constitution and that of the creation of the European Union itself , that is , respect for national languages and cultures .
according to this article , which is based on Council Regulation No 974 / 98 of 1998 , there would be an unprecedented intervention in the grammatical systems shaped over thousands of years and in semantic relations expressed not in word order , not in words with one form , but in the declension of words , of the languages of the seven new countries of the European Union , among them the Lithuanian language .
the Regulation mentioned , announced six years ago , before the new countries were admitted to the European Union , does not allow the word euro to be declined .
such a ban contradicts Article 314 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the Treaty on European Union on the true equality of the European Union &apos;s official languages , as well as European Community Treaty Article 5 on subsidisation and Article 151 on the limits of cultural policies .
I asked the Commission and the Council why these circumstances have not been taken into consideration and four months later Mr Almunia , the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs , replied that the non @-@ declinable word euro is used in the Constitution because this was laid down in the Council Regulation .
back to square one , and disrespect for national languages remained .
if such a ban remains in the Constitution , then in the Lithuanian version and all legislation we will have an abundance of not only ungrammatical but absurd statements .
I hope that Parliament will take these arguments into account .
thank you for your attention .
- Mr President , a Constitution is the founding act of a State , and it was an entirely conscious decision to choose that term , just as it was to give the EU a flag , an anthem , a motto and even a national celebration .
despite your pathetic denials , the European Constitution is , therefore , without doubt , the founding act of a European superstate .
it represents the death of our often ancient nations and their transformation into a number of powerless provinces within this bureaucratic , omnipotent and centralised State .
I know that you blithely accuse those who do not share your blind belief in the benefits of the Europe of Brussels of lies , of mediocrity and even of stupidity .
this is a handy tactic and entails never having to explain .
it also makes it possible to follow the peremptory statements of the happy few , who know - or think they know - what is good for the , in their view , uncultivated , masses .
the fear instilled in you by the fact that referendums are to be held on the Constitution is an illustration of the contempt in which you hold the citizens .
what , for that matter , are the benefits of which people speak ?
I have seen with my own eyes , as a direct consequence of European policies , the destruction of our farming and of our economies , company relocations and deindustrialisation , endemic unemployment and poverty , the disintegration of our social protection systems , the opening of our borders to immigration on a massive scale , to terrorism and to international crime .
the Europe of Brussels is not , of course , solely responsible - it could not have created or exacerbated these problems without the collusion of governments , of all political hues , which have decided to sacrifice their countries &quot; independence and their inhabitants &quot; freedom to the Brussels Leviathan .
the European Constitution will put the finishing touches to this monstrous edifice , which was begun over 40 years ago .
that might be what you want , but we are rejecting it because Europe and the Europeans deserve better than this soulless superstate .
we are rejecting it in the name of freedom , in the name of independence , in the name of the sovereignty which belongs solely to the people and which is inalienable , and in the name of those people &apos;s right to self @-@ determination .
the Members of this House have betrayed their homelands .
their guilt is there for all to see .
they will be cursed by history and by future generations .
- Mr President , we would be making a serious mistake if we considered the Union to be merely an economic entity or a vast free @-@ trade area , or even a kind of superstate replacing the national states .
Europe is primarily a great ideal , and it was an ideal for the founding fathers Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer , from Robert Schuman to Altiero Spinelli , from Gaetano Martino to Helmut Kohl .
Europe is our history : it is the synthesis of our cultures and our languages , our identity and our future .
it is the Europe of values , of the central importance of the individual , of freedom , solidarity and subsidiarity .
we cannot think of a Union shut in tightly within its borders ; we cannot think of Europe as a machine - albeit an efficient one - run by a bureaucracy that keeps changing the rules .
on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity itself , Europe must instead solve the major problems of its citizens which other institutions are unable to address .
does the Constitution interpret these values ?
the answer is substantially &apos; yes , &quot; even though we cannot hide our profound regret that there is no reference to the Union &apos;s Judaeo @-@ Christian roots .
such a reference would have represented not a religious choice , but the identification of our undeniable historical roots .
the decision to sign the Constitution in Rome was , for our country , an important acknowledgement of the work carried out during the six months of Italy &apos;s Presidency .
to be effective , a fundamental law needs to have life breathed into it ; in other words , it has to be put into practice and invested with political power .
that is why Europe , through the Constitution , really must speak with a single voice in foreign policy .
it must win a seat on the new UN Security Council and it must be an exporter of peace and not just of special interests in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East .
the world of globalisation needs this Europe , the Europe of solidarity , subsidiarity and human rights - the political Europe of the people whom this Parliament truly represents .
thank you , Mr President .
there can be no doubt that Europe , the Member States , and , above all , Europe &apos;s citizens need a European Constitution .
the present framework of the Treaties is too narrow for an enlarging Europe .
what was adequate for 15 Member States is no longer adequate for 25 Member States .
after all , one would not try to dress a fully @-@ grown 25 @-@ year @-@ old in the same suit he wore when he was 15 years old .
he would need to be bought a new one .
the same is true for Europe , and the enlarged European Union must therefore have a legal and organisational framework that corresponds to its size , intentions and ambitions .
the European Constitution creates such a framework .
the Constitution is a good document as it represents a compromise .
it makes the EU more citizen @-@ friendly , more efficient and better .
it also makes the Union a place where human beings are valued and where democracy and security are safeguarded .
moreover , it provides for a high level of protection of citizens &quot; personal rights , and grants them better access to the affairs of the entire EU and influence on the European Union &apos;s legislative capacities .
the EU &apos;s citizens are well aware of this , and this is why they support the European Constitution in such large numbers , even if they are not entirely familiar with the details of its contents .
this is the case in my country , Poland .
I am proud to be able to tell you that 73 % of Poles are in favour of the European Constitution , despite the reservations previously expressed by my government with regard to the draft Treaty , and despite the campaign that has been conducted against the Constitution within the country .
it has become apparent that it is a mistake to exploit the Constitution in domestic political disputes .
no political party has the right to call for the Constitution to be rejected , even if it is in opposition .
referendums on the Constitution should relate to its contents , and not turn into anti @-@ governmental plebiscites .
the citizens of the European Union are aware of this , and this is why they know better than politicians what is good for them .
they subscribe to the view that whoever is in favour of Europe is in favour of the European Constitution .
we should listen to them .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Constitution , or Constitutional Treaty , is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have previously had , and , as it is a good and acceptable compromise , our group really can vote to endorse it .
we should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being , above all , a great chance to construct a shared European identity .
that is what we in Europe need : a sense of being &apos; us , &quot; a feeling of belonging together , with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Germans , Westphalians from the north of the Rhine , and , in my case , citizens of Cologne - all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty .
we have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty , thereby making this old continent into something of a new world , for the wonderful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defining in precise terms what holds us together .
if this feeling of being &apos; us , &quot; this identity , is to come into being , it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution .
that is why we are campaigning for referendums on it in every European country , for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty , not all Europeans can .
if the people of Europe are to know , firstly , that this Constitution exists , and secondly , having given it some thought , that they want it , it is vital that they themselves should be asked .
we should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendums are held in every country .
it will not , unfortunately , be possible to organise it so that they are held all on the same day , but , if people themselves are asked , it will in any case enhance their sense of identity , their awareness of being &apos; us . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , I would invite you to see this Constitutional Treaty in perspective and not as the finished article .
the European idea has never been fixed , and it will not now be fixed in the wording of this new Treaty .
this Constitution is an important , essential and indispensable staging post , but it is still only a staging post .
Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing said of this document that it was unhoped @-@ for .
I prefer to say of it that , broadly speaking , it can still be improved , given the extent to which , and despite the unquestionable advances it entails , the dross from the previous documents still clings to it .
our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an interim report on their common history but have no desire to be taken hostage by it for decades , with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty @-@ first century indefinitely postponed .
that is the whole point of Amendment No 17 , which I have tabled on behalf of my group and which a great many of my fellow MEPs have co @-@ signed .
through this very clear and very brief amendment , our Parliament , and I quote , &apos; &#91; a &#93; nnounces its intention of using the new right of initiative conferred upon it by the Constitution to propose amendments to the latter . &quot;
I would thank our two co @-@ rapporteurs , Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , for having supported this amendment , as it is the medium through which our House indicates that , while remaining forever the driving force of European development , it is attentive to the social and democratic advances awaited by our fellow citizens .
if the document were to be set in stone , there would be a danger of the same thing happening to the Constitution too .
moreover , any stone out of which the Constitutional Treaty were to be carved would not , whatever Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing may think , be that out of which the equestrian statue commemorating the President of the Convention would also be carved . it might , rather , be that marking the grave of the European project .
the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance would therefore again invite you to embrace a progressive Europe , as the constitutional process is still in its early days , and its strength and interest lie specifically in its newness .
I once wrote a book on the emergence of human rights theory and on the American Constitution , so I have some understanding of the positive aspects of this document .
what I do not understand , however , is why the European Parliament wishes freely to condemn itself to a second @-@ class position by supporting this document .
Article III @-@ 330 ( 2 ) reads as follows : &apos; a European law of the European Parliament shall lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members .
the European Parliament shall act on its own initiative after seeking an opinion from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the Council .
the Council shall act unanimously on all rules or conditions relating to the taxation of Members or former Members . &quot;
this preserves the supremacy of the Commission , the executive , which has more rights than we do , and it also preserves the unjust disparities between us as legitimate representatives of the European people .
only we are truly legitimate , with all the other European bodies being derivative , and so I believe that this provision must be omitted .
although Mrs Wallström has just said that we would have more democracy , I do not think that it is more democracy we want , but merely democracy , pure and simple .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if you gave the Constitution , or whatever you ultimately call it , to a cartoonist in any country of Europe who respects the principles of democracy , of national sovereignty , of the values of the historic and cultural heritage , he would draw it like a mincer from which various parts of various animals , from sheep to cows , come out in the form of minced meat .
but people are not animals and it is a crime to treat them like minced meat .
fascism did it with weapons and some people appear to envy its intentions , and 65 years later certain other weapons such as money and propaganda are being used for the same reason .
we therefore say no to the canning of the peoples of Europe , no to the law of the jungle which throttles the weak , no to the imposition of underhand approaches and people and no to efforts to turn citizens into docile robots in the hands of multinationals and banks .
we say yes to the right of opinion and rejection , yes to the Europe of sovereign nations , yes to Christianity and human rights , yes to the pride and dignity of the peoples .
&apos;i recognise you by the fierce edge of your sword .
I recognise you by the look which measures the earth with force . &quot;
and force used on the spirit is worse than force against the body .
there is still time for resistance .
we have time to reverse globalisation and the new order of things . &apos; .
Mr President , since the first six countries joined forces , the European Communities have developed a form of cooperation that is not perfect but that is nonetheless a form of cooperation between states of equal value whose governments have the last word concerning the states &quot; cooperative participation .
what is more , the adherents of this Constitution have not today concealed the fact that Europe is to be governed not by the countries &quot; governments but by a strong Commission whose parliamentary legality lies in the directly elected European Parliament .
my party and I dispute the sense and validity of this construction .
this Constitution removes countries &quot; independence in favour of a non @-@ transparent regime pursuing objectives that , in all too many cases , do not have grass @-@ roots support .
my country &apos;s oldest constitutional document , the Jutish Law of 1241 , states , for example , and I quote : &apos; the law shall be honest and just , tolerable in terms of the country &apos;s customs , appropriate , useful and clear , so that everyone might know and understand what the law says . &quot;
it may be said of the Constitution that we are debating in this House today that it is not honest about the intentions behind it .
if it is just , it is only so in the eyes of those who wish to amass power throughout the whole of Europe .
it is not tolerable for the majority of Europeans , for it only corresponds to the customs of a few countries .
it is of no use in terms of free cooperation , and it is not clear , for no one can know and understand what the Constitution says .
this draft Constitution must be rejected .
otherwise , the EU will end up as a regime of the big powers , which will damage the EU as a whole .
I recommend the minority &apos;s amendment .
Europe deserves better .
please allow me , ladies and gentlemen , to use my time to explain the actual supplementary proposal , to digress a little from the spirit of the previous discussion .
the proposal I refer to , Proposal No 10 , corrects one of the discrepancies introduced by the Constitution , those discrepancies about which so much has been said today .
in fact , the text of the agricultural policy is out of date in the Constitution , fifty years out of date .
the legitimate aim of agricultural policy half a century ago was to produce sufficient food .
today the situation is reversed , Europe has the problem of disposing of its surpluses .
the European Parliament &apos;s AGRI committee has even pointed , in its views on the Constitution , to the direct conflict between the original aims of the common agricultural policy and the Constitution .
on the other hand , increased competitiveness is a priority aim of all the reforms which have been and are being made in the common agricultural policy - but this is not included in the Constitution .
the draft amendment rights this wrong .
it would also be desirable for the European Parliament to adopt this draft amendment because , in the entire resolution of the European Parliament , this is actually the only reference to the most important common policy - the agricultural policy .
the subject of our debate , the Constitution , may be the first joint creation of the reunited Europe .
the Member States may also regard it as their own , as we , including myself , participated in the work of the Convention drafting the Constitution for a year and a half .
it is , perhaps , not by accident that two new Member States , Lithuania and Hungary were the first to ratify the Constitution .
the Hungarian parliament even proposed an amendment including minority rights among the fundamental principles of the Constitution .
it is an important basic principle , since Europe is also the Europe of minorities , and everyone is a minority in Europe .
at the same time , it is important that minority rights are exercised collectively and mutually and that the Constitution allows for this as well .
this is , therefore , very pleasing to us .
however , I find it a little unsettling that there are many people here in the European Parliament and also among the European public who were offended by the acknowledgement of the historical fact that Christianity contributed to building a joint Europe , to the creation of today &apos;s Europe .
it was by no means an attempt to get rid of a secular Europe , but we found it necessary that in addition to mentioning the inheritance of humanism , enlightenment and other common European values , the preamble acknowledged the contribution of Christianity to this joint Europe and its role in making it possible for us to be here today .
I am , however , pleased that the Constitution allows for an institutional dialogue between churches and the European Union , which is a very important aspect for churches .
this holds true , no matter how many disapprove of this idea .
as the leader of the Hungarian Socialist delegation and as a president of the Intergroup for historical national minorities , regional languages and constitutional regions , I welcome the Constitutional Treaty .
this Constitutional Treaty is of historic importance in many regards .
it is definitely so for national minorities , as it will be the first time in the history of the Union that national minority rights become part of the .
at last a working system can finally be established to protect minority rights within the European Union .
as a Hungarian Socialist , I am especially proud that it was my government who initiated the section regarding minority groups .
millions of people belonging to national minority groups will celebrate the Constitutional Treaty &apos;s coming into effect .
I represent a country where 10 % of the population is made up of minorities , and from a cultural point of view , one third of its people lives outside its national borders .
as a representative in the European Parliament , I had the right to say in the Hungarian parliament &apos;s ratification debate that every country , including Hungary , shall now have two Constitutions .
the more generous Constitution is to be observed .
we must ensure that we always refer to the Constitution that grants more rights to our citizens , to the citizens of Europe .
all countries will become richer in this respect .
with regard to minority rights , the Hungarian Constitution is far more generous than the European Constitutional Treaty , as it includes collective rights , acknowledges national minorities as decision @-@ making factors in legislation , and in addition to equal treatment , it emphasises the importance of favourable treatment , positive discrimination and allows minorities to establish their own institutions of self @-@ government at all levels .
Mr President , there is plenty of criticism that could be levelled at the Constitutional Treaty , and , although the text is certainly an improvement on what we have at present , the question remains as to whether it is good enough .
in my view , there are a few missed opportunities in a number of areas .
let us , for example , consider the election of the President of the European Commission .
as I see it , the European public , or at least the European Parliament , should be asked to vote .
indeed , that is what is stated in the new Constitution , but in the first instance there is only one candidate , as opposed to various candidates , so there is no choice .
the same applies to codecision : a wonderful European model , a broad majority of peoples and a political majority should apply across the board .
that may be what the Constitution stipulates , but very little will be put into practice right now .
it follows that there is room for much more efficiency and more democracy .
when it comes to ratifying the Constitution , and certainly in countries where a referendum is to be held on it , the debate will not , though , be about subtleties and the differences between the old and new situation .
that is a debate reserved for connoisseurs like us .
the treaty is about more than these innovations ; it is about the text as a whole .
we will be voting on a text which is an outline of what we have built up over 50 years of Europe - fifty years of peace , security , free movement of persons , goods , services and capital .
if I consider the opportunities and challenges which the Dutch , along with all Europeans , are able to take on in this large Union , then I have no doubts and vote in favour .
a referendum will be held in the Netherlands in a few months &quot; time .
I am already opposed to the argument that , as a result of the new Constitutional Treaty , the imminent accession of Turkey would mean that small Member States , such as the Netherlands , would more or less disappear into oblivion within the Union .
this is rabble @-@ rousing , because Turkey is a separate decision and the public should , in my view , make up its own mind in a referendum when the time comes .
it is , however , also a sign of small @-@ minded thinking .
it is in the present institutional chaos of Europe that large Member States can exert disproportionate amounts of influence , and smaller Member States benefit from law and order .
I am in favour of proper and democratic governance and against chaos .
during the forthcoming referendum , the Dutch Liberals will campaign actively in favour of the EU &apos;s new Constitutional Treaty .
Mr President , the worst sentence in the Constitution , which is in conflict with the basic idea of the Coal and Steel Union , is &apos; Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities . &quot;
if the purpose had been only to reduce the defence budget through greater efficiency , that is what would have been stated .
now , the clear aim is to increase the EU &apos;s military striking power .
from disarmament , we are now moving towards rearmament .
if we combine this with the wording to the effect that &apos; &#91; I &#93; n its relations with the wider world , the Union shall uphold and promote its values and interests , &quot; we see a return to a 500 year @-@ old colonial policy .
this may cause anxiety in the wider world , which remembers the last time we wanted to spread our civilisation with the help of the army .
it might perhaps create peace between ourselves , but in the world it will create anxiety .
this is not a document for the future .
it is a return to old @-@ style imperialism and colonialism .
it is something I reject .
Mr President , I am in favour of rejecting the Constitution , as is all my group .
at the same time I would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament does not have competence in this matter .
this debate and the committee initiative report to be adopted , which is based on it , have no legal basis or value .
one reason why the Constitution should be rejected is that it means the militarisation of the European Union .
under the Constitution , Member States even have to agree to increase their military expenditure .
it is quite incredible that there should be a provision on such a subject at the level of the EU Constitution .
governments of the Member States are behaving as if the Constitution were already in force .
it has been decided to establish 13 battle groups , and to equip them as if they were shock troops .
in fact they are shock troops , as the intention is to use them for illegal military operations just because the EU decides to .
we in the Convention did not adopt a ruling for the Constitution stating that operations outside the EU &apos;s borders must always be lawful - in other words , that they must always have a mandate from the United Nations .
the Constitution should be rejected , but let the people do it .
in fact , the people of just one nation will suffice .
Mr President , this is the first time delegates have been present here who bring with them 50 years &quot; experience of life under totalitarianism .
today , although we are dealing with the draft European Constitution , I occasionally feel as if I am back in the old times .
an unelected get @-@ together known as the Convention has produced a rushed document .
in a similar way , a powerful elite once made decisions in our country and then issued its resolutions as predestined inevitabilities .
we are today being told that rejection of the Constitution would cause a catastrophe of cosmic proportions .
life has ultimately shown that no catastrophes have occurred , and the same is true now .
a hybrid structure mixing constitutional principles with practical policies has been developed , opening up boundless scope for interpretation by uncontrollable EU officials .
there is a parallel here , as well , as we too have had documents passing decisions from our country to others without authorisation .
we are sitting here today in a Chamber adorned with lavish banners on the Constitution .
on such occasions , we too used to put up banners and listen to noisy brass bands , so that the essence of the document which had been approved was eclipsed by the euphoria .
we do not need a European Constitution , and what we certainly do not need is this fuzzy document we are about to vote on .
what we also do not need is to expend EU resources on spectacular celebrations .
we should do better to send the money to Sri Lanka .
- Mr President , I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party .
we feel that we must warmly welcome the new European Constitution .
the Member States are transferring a growing proportion of their sovereignty to benefit an ambitious global idea , whereby 25 countries tread a common path together , side by side .
it is 21 years since this Chamber , by a large majority , adopted the plan to reform the European Union that had been drawn up by the Italian Member Altiero Spinelli .
it was a complex and daring plan , which was clearly designed to create a more integrated Community .
since then , little by little , the nations of the old continent have continued to add to and to develop the reasons for uniting within this international framework , which has undergone remarkable modifications and changes .
the Constitution , signed on 29 October in Rome , just as in 1957 , is a fundamental achievement in that context .
half a century later , Europe &apos;s road has come back to the place where it all began : an exciting new challenge involving us all in creating and building the Europe of tomorrow .
Mr President , as Vice @-@ Chairman of the Convention , I can only rejoice at the likelihood of the European Parliament , tomorrow , and by an overwhelming majority , declaring itself in favour of this Constitution .
although the European Parliament need not give its opinion formally for some time , this position on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , in my view , sends a strong message to Europe .
it is true that we , in the Convention , tried to provide an answer to the challenges that Europe is facing , namely enlargement and globalisation , and this Constitution would not have assumed its present dimensions without the European Parliament &apos;s important contribution .
I think that this Constitution , although it is a compromise , has , in terms of quality , been a considerable step forward .
the Constitution provides the institutional framework that the enlarged Europe requires .
indeed , it is impossible for Europe to continue to work with the same institutions and the same rules as it did when there were fifteen Member States .
at the same time , I think that the true dimension of this Constitution is that we , although the first step was taken at Maastricht , are only now really changing from an economic community to a political union : the end of the pillars , the communitisation of the third pillar as regards the area of freedom and justice and a far more developed external policy , enabling Europe to speak with one voice in this globalised world .
although I hope that a large majority will support this Constitution tomorrow , let us not forget that we in this House carry a major responsibility in convincing the Member States that Europe needs it .
I declare the session adjourned until 3 p.m .
ladies and gentlemen , before the two votes which will take place today at noon , I should like to give the floor for one minute to Mr McMillan @-@ Scott , Chairman of the Delegation for Observation of the Palestinian Presidential Elections and Vice @-@ President of the Parliament .
. Mr President , we have all returned safely from Palestine .
I wish to thank my colleagues - there were 28 of us , the largest ever delegation of the European Parliament - the vice @-@ chairman , Mrs Napoletano , and the staff who accompanied us and prepared the observation mission .
our task , as Members of the European Parliament , is to deliver an informed political verdict on this crucial election at the Brussels part @-@ session later this month .
however , we feel that the Palestinian people - especially the women - should be proud .
in spite of the Israeli occupation and the lack of opportunity for East Jerusalem residents and others to vote , this election prepares the ground for the Palestinian parliamentary elections in July and could serve as a model for others in the region .
I hope that the European Parliament will respond to the appetite for democracy in the Arab world as a whole .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
recommendation ( A6 @-@ 0001 / 2005 ) by James Nicholson , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds concerning the extension of the duration of the PEACE programme and the granting of new commitment appropriations ( 16064 / 2004 - COM ( 2004 ) 0631 - C6 @-@ 0252 / 2004 - 2004 / 0224 ( AVC ) )
. Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to address colleagues before , hopefully , my report is voted through plenary .
the PEACE programme is of much more than purely financial importance to Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland .
it is the most visible contribution so far by the European Union to building a stable society in Northern Ireland and , to that extent , it has enormous symbolic value as well .
it is a fine example of the European Union offering assistance without interfering in the local political process .
on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland , I thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that this report was able to go through its parliamentary stages at speed .
I am grateful to the chairman and the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for addressing the proposal as a priority once it was received from the Commission .
I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient handling of the budgetary question , which has enabled us to vote today .
whilst I am also grateful to the Council and the Commission , I regret that the British and Irish governments did not ask for a higher sum of money .
the amount allocated falls somewhat short of initial expectations .
however , I am pleased that the PEACE programme is being extended and would be grateful for strong support for this symbol of EU commitment to all the people of Northern Ireland .
the next item is the election of the European Ombudsman .
the election will be held in accordance with Rule 194 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I have received the following nominations :
- Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros
- Mr Giuseppe Fortunato
two other nominations have been declared inadmissible .
( a secret ballot was held )
the outcome of the vote on the election of the European Ombudsman is as follows :
Members voting : 643
blank or void ballot papers : 34
votes cast : 609
majority required : 305
the results were as follows :
Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS 564 votes
Giuseppe FORTUNATO 45 votes
the majority of votes cast were for Mr Diamandouros , who is therefore elected European Ombudsman .
I would like to congratulate him on his election , and to call upon him to take an oath immediately before the Court of Justice , in accordance with Rule 194 ( 7 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
. congratulations , Mr Diamandouros .
we hope that you will pursue actively , as you did during your previous mandate , your activities under Article 195 of the EC Treaty .
we know what a vital role the Ombudsman plays , enhancing the responsibility of the Community administration , as well as stimulating thinking on practices and procedures .
I promise that the Commission will continue to work actively and closely with you .
the Commission is also aware of the fact that citizens are making increasing use of their right to complain to the European Ombudsman .
the number of complaints rose substantially during the first ten months of last year , compared to the same period in 2003 .
this seems to mean that the rise in the number of complaints reflects the fact that citizens know about their rights , rather than any worsening in the administrative behaviour of European institutions - at least , that is what we hope .
the Commission is looking forward to improving its cooperation with the European Ombudsman .
we wish you all the best in your important work .
that concludes the vote .
recommendation : Nicholson ( A6 @-@ 0001 / 2005 )
.
today I voted in favour of the extension of PEACE Funding but I did so with considerable reservation .
that reservation arises from the fact that , to date , PEACE Funding in Northern Ireland has been allocated in a most imbalanced way , to the gross disadvantage to the Protestant / Unionist Community .
it has also favoured terrorist prisoner groups over victim groups , who exist as victims because of the horror visited upon them by those terrorists .
during this extension of PEACE Funding I am looking for an overt righting of these wrongs .
this funding must be allocated in an even @-@ handed manner .
.
I am delighted to support this report and welcome the proposed extension of the PEACE programme to cover this year and 2006 .
this decision will allow the PEACE measures , designed to support reconciliation , to be carried on for another few years .
the continuation of these peace initiatives is invaluable in rebuilding trust between communities and bringing communities together from both sides of the border .
peace focuses specifically on reconciliation and the projects it has funded have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations .
I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 and sincerely hope that further provision will be made in the Financial Perspectives when they are finally established and come into effect in 2007 .
there is no doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross @-@ border and North @-@ South initiatives funded under this programme .
the PEACE programme is justified as an internal matter for the EU .
the players that have the main and ultimate responsibility for achieving a consolidation of the peace process are , however , Ireland and Great Britain .
as the June List sees it , it is of crucial importance that economic aid not be used as a form of &apos; structural aid , &quot; but that it be used for bringing about real and practical improvements that promote positive development of the peace process in Northern Ireland .
if it were only up to the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , the draft Constitution would be much more ambitious than the one presented to us .
it would enable us to give substance to the political , social and ecological Europe that we champion .
it would be a project with unambiguous and definite objectives and not include this third part that , in merely echoing the earlier treaties , is an obstacle to an ambitious global project for Europe .
in spite of its imperfections , I shall however vote , and call upon others to vote , in favour of this Constitutional Treaty , for it would be an aberration and a major political error to throw in one &apos;s lot with those opposed to the Constitution , on the pretext that the final wording is not commensurate with what is at stake .
we need Europe , even an imperfect Europe , more than ever .
with a Constitution , we shall succeed in launching this peace @-@ oriented Europe , the bearer of common values such as human rights and democracy .
it is by taking this major step that Europeans will feel united in a genuine common project .
it is a militant &apos; yes &quot; that I shall stand up for in voting on the Corbett report .
not to rise to this historic occasion would be to deny our own work as builders of Europe and would , for some considerable time , inhibit what we wish to see , namely the ambitious development of European integration ...
.
I congratulate Mr Nicholson on his excellent work on the recommendation concerning the extension of the duration of the PEACE programme .
the PEACE programme , which was started in 1995 , is aimed at fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in border areas of the Republic of Ireland .
following the success of the PEACE I programme , the Berlin European Council of 1999 decided to extend the programme for a further five years , in order to provide continuity to the projects that had been set up .
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;s position that in this region of Europe , which has endured over 30 years of violence , all energies should be channelled into making it possible to maintain social inclusion , economic development and employment , urban and rural regeneration and cross @-@ border cooperation .
it is therefore essential to extend the implementation of the PEACE programme by two years , until the end of 2006 , coinciding with the programming period for the Structural Funds and with a proposal to extend the annual Community contribution to the International Fund for Ireland for the same period .
the wider aim , therefore , is to align the measures financed by these two instruments with interventions carried out in the region under EU cohesion policy .
.
I welcome this report , which formally gives the backing of the European Parliament to continued EU funding for the European Peace Fund until the year 2006 .
in 2005 and 2006 , EUR 108 million are being allocated to this fund which is supporting projects in the border county region and Northern Ireland .
one third of this fund , EUR 36 million , will be spent in the border county region , the remaining EUR 72 million being spent in Northern Ireland .
the European Peace Fund 2000 @-@ 2004 supported 4 000 projects in Northern Ireland and the border county region alone .
the European Union also gives EUR 15 million a year towards the International Fund for Ireland and has supported consecutive Interreg programmes dating back to the late 1980s .
in the overall context of the peace process in Ireland , the European Union has been at the forefront in providing political and financial support - and it is clear that it will continue to play an active and central role in this regard .
.
I voted in favour of Mr Nicholson &apos;s report on the PEACE programme for Northern Ireland , because I feel that it is extremely important for the EU to show solidarity with the Irish peace process .
our solidarity should be channelled into benefiting the wide range of sectors , groups and communities worst affected by the violence , and into fostering inter @-@ community projects .
financial management through locally @-@ based partnership structures and sectorally specialised non @-@ governmental organisations will help to strengthen the ties of peace and reconciliation that are crucial to stabilisation in Northern Ireland .
I also consider essential the objective of financial consistency that has been set out as a result of the extension of the implementation of the PEACE programme for a further two years , given that it constitutes a step towards aligning the actions financed by this instrument and by the International Fund for Ireland with interventions carried out in the region under the EU cohesion policy .
.
in a Europe that has proved capable of building peace within its borders , phenomena such as those in Northern Ireland and the Basque Country have , fortunately , become fewer and farther between .
given the serious nature of these situations , however , the EU must continue to condemn vehemently and unconditionally the use of violence as a means of solving political issues .
in the context of the ceasefire initiatives and the opening of negotiations between the two sides in the Northern Ireland conflict , I feel that similar determination must be shown as regards any initiatives intended to help establish lasting peace in those territories .
against this backdrop , I welcome the fact that financial support is to be maintained for Northern Ireland and for border areas of the Republic of Ireland , and that the PEACE II programme is to be extended for a further two years .
we are therefore continuing with the debate on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe .
- Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , the new Treaty is a positive step from an institutional point of view , as everyone has pointed out .
the new Treaty gives us a Union that is stronger , more democratic and closer to the citizens .
it is also a Constitution which , most importantly , represents shared values and is a political project .
we see this straightaway with the constitutionalisation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is aimed at creating a society that sees itself as a social market economy and that targets full employment .
these are not mere words ; they are the EU &apos;s new objectives , which are enshrined in Article 3 of Part 1 of the Treaty and which must guide all of its actions and policies .
Article 185 of Part III on monetary policy , for example , expressly states that , without prejudice to the objective of price stability , the European System of Central Banks supports the general economic policies in the Union in order to contribute to the achievement of its objectives as laid down in Article I @-@ 3 .
horizontal application clauses should also be highlighted .
these clauses guide the Union &apos;s actions and policies laid down in Part III of the Treaty .
accordingly , Articles 115 to 122 of Part III , for example , state that the various policies of the EU must ensure that equality between men and women is promoted , that the environment is protected , that consumers are protected , that social rights such as employment are guaranteed and that public services or services of general economic interest have the necessary conditions to fulfil their missions .
these examples show how the new Treaty strengthens the European social model .
it does not backtrack on any gains that have been made and enshrines new and important advances .
it is therefore good news , in that it gives tangible form to our desire to live in a society with high levels of social protection and high environmental values .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , five years ago , there were some of us in this House who wished to revive Spinelli &apos;s Crocodile Club .
at that time , we started a federalist cross @-@ party group designed to work towards a European Constitution .
there were many who laughed in a rather indulgent way then .
in my home country of Sweden , I was patted on the head when I talked about the need for a common document that clearly stated what we stand for , why we stand for those things and how we work .
now , no one is laughing any more , and talking about a European Constitution is not especially controversial .
most people are in favour of it .
through the Convention and through hard work , especially here in the European Parliament , we now have a draft European Constitution .
that is fantastic progress .
it makes the EU stronger , more open and more democratic , puts the citizen centre stage and simplifies decision @-@ making .
Mr Corbett &apos;s and Mr Méndez de Vigo &apos;s resolution gives a very sound and instructive account of the advantages of the new Constitution and is a document that can in actual fact be used in the campaign , since it is written in such an educational way .
certainly , a lot could have been better , and many fellow MEPs have talked about the fact in this House .
personally , I should have liked to have seen a clearer demarcation of the EU &apos;s powers .
with so many Member States , it would have been sensible to concentrate upon rather fewer issues at EU level so as to be more effective in these areas .
I should also have liked to have seen the permanent President placed not in the Council but in the Commission .
finally , I regret that the Convention did not discuss the issue of the European Parliament &apos;s seat .
we must stop this commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels .
it is expensive and inefficient and , as long as it goes on , people will never fully trust this institution .
a new era is on the way .
we shall be able to adopt new reforms and shall be able in the future to take further steps with a view to the next Convention and the next Constitution .
firstly , the present Constitution must be ratified and , overall , this is a very good draft .
it constitutes progress for European democracy and for our citizens .
opponents must bear in mind that the alternative is the Treaty of Nice , which does not in any way increase democracy within the EU .
nor does the Treaty of Nice make it any easier for us to cooperate with so many Member States .
I am therefore looking forward with great enthusiasm to the debate that is now in the offing and that is already going on in the various Member States and to being out with you on the streets and in marketplaces defending the European Constitution .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , together with the Flemish Greens , I will , over the next few months , be conducting a campaign for Belgian ratification of the Constitution in the federal , Flemish and Brussels parliaments .
tomorrow , however , we are not voting on the Constitution , but on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , which I regard as disappointing .
it is an apology , an excessively one @-@ sided enumeration of the Constitution &apos;s many benefits .
what a missed opportunity , Mr Corbett !
should we not have given more consideration to the criticism that is now being levelled by the Left ?
why , for example , is it not possible to state that we are still on our way towards a fully @-@ fledged European democracy , that the role of the constitutional regions is snowed under , that too many areas of policy are still left for intergovernmental cooperation , that there are too many areas in which the veto still applies ?
why can it not be said that the European Union is still too much in need of a social order , and that its orientation is too neoliberal ?
that is why I would ask you to revisit the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , particularly Amendments Nos 4 , 9 , 15 and 16 and , I hope , support them when we vote tomorrow .
- Mr President , among the various reasons for our opposition to this new Treaty I should like to highlight the fact that it reinforces centralism , federalism and European bureaucracy , that it calls for policies applicable to all Member States of the Union , irrespective of their actual situations , and that it embeds neoliberalism and the militarisation of Europe more deeply .
the blind impositions of the Stability and Growth Pact , the European Central Bank and the monetary and single currency policies in the euro zone , regardless of the reality of each individual country , have led to a deterioration in the social situation , to an increase in inequalities arising from the privatisation of strategic sectors and public services and to appalling attacks on workers &quot; rights .
we have also seen how these practices in agriculture , fisheries and in external trade policy have led to economic recessions , to unemployment and to the collapse of production in increasingly large sectors in countries with weaker economies .
by the same token , we cannot accept the promotion campaign for the new Treaty , which is scarcely democratic and certainly not pluralist , based as it is on the arguments of its supporters , disregarding the arguments of those who are opposed to it , those fighting for a more social , more democratic Europe founded on the principle of sovereign States with equal rights and committed to peace .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a Constitution should lay down the ground rules for policy and the rights due to citizens of a democracy .
a Constitution should not establish the content of policy .
social policy and policy relating to taxes , energy , policing and issues concerned with alcohol should be drawn up by the people of each country , acting together through the democratic process .
when the will of the people changes in a country , it must be possible for policy to be changed .
the draft with which we are now confronted is something quite different .
it is an expression of the political class &apos;s own ambitions for the European project .
it regulates in detail ; it deals with tourism and agriculture ; it legitimises a corporate society ; it forces each Member State into a currency union ; and it points towards a concentration of power and a Europe governed by technocrats .
what is presented here as a Constitution is an attempt by the political establishment to usurp the European peoples &quot; democratic right to shape their own futures .
that is why the June List rejects this draft .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the task of European integration has brought about the world &apos;s largest area of law and economic freedom , but the organisation of our continent cannot stop there .
Europe must become a political player , a political unit endowed with democratic power and diplomatic clout .
we want a Europe of states and peoples and , consequently , we wish to strengthen people &apos;s confidence in the European Union .
that is indeed what is proposed by the Constitution signed in Rome .
I again congratulate our rapporteurs , Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , and would emphasise the progress made through the new Treaty .
the rapporteurs are sending out a clear message to our fellow citizens : the Constitution is fine , with the best possible wording .
it proposes a more integrated , more efficient and more political Europe which is more attentive to people and stronger both internally and externally .
the Constitution , as such , does not increase the competences of the EU .
it prevents the emergence of a centralised superstate , it sanctions the legal personality of the EU and it gives the EU a human face in the form of a long @-@ term President and a Foreign Minister .
it also guarantees all our fellow citizens protection under the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the European Parliament is gaining ground on the European political stage .
finally , the Constitution facilitates recourse to enhanced cooperation , making it possible to face up to what will be at stake in the future .
the destiny of a European country is now inseparable from the affirmation of its European personality .
the Constitution represents the best way for our Member States to confront the future , starting from now .
for them to be united around a document that they have all approved is very ambitious .
what now will turn this ambition into a reality is the will of politicians and , in the first place , of ourselves .
Mr President , the Dutch delegation within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that the debate is about the Constitution rather than about whether we are in favour of Europe or against it .
we are in favour , with reservations , because what matters to us are the benefits of the new Constitution compared to the Treaty of Nice .
the Europe of Nice is undecided as to how significant it is .
the new Treaty , however , guarantees the influence of regional , decentralised authorities , and designates the national parliament as a watchdog , so that Europe , rather than threatening to turn into a superstate , provides effective and cross @-@ border cooperation in respect of crime and food safety .
in addition , in the new Constitution , more than 30 types of decisions have been replaced by a handful of terms readily recognisable by the public , including &apos; law &quot; and &apos; enabling legislation . &quot;
with this , the Constitution introduces more clarity about the type of Europe we would like and decision @-@ making that we use to that end .
the Constitution also brings us more effectiveness by extending the number of areas in which decisions are taken by qualified majority , thus ensuring that one country cannot put a spanner in the works .
more democratic accountability is introduced by removal of much decision @-@ making from the backrooms , and by making the Council &apos;s decision @-@ making meetings public .
finally , the Constitution brings us more rights for the citizens : social dialogue , the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as well as the citizens &quot; initiative , of course .
anyone who fails to support this important step in the European integration process will become responsible for perpetuating the present Treaty of Nice , which is more bureaucratic , slower , and in many ways undemocratic .
our &apos; yes &quot; is one that is tinged with a critical observation , because Europe is still very much lacking one voice .
social Europe is still inadequately anchored ; hence a critical &apos; yes . &quot;
in short , the Dutch delegation within the PSE Group gives a critical &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution .
around the referendum in the spring , we will be enthusiastically advocating this position , supported by Johan Cruyff , Catalan Dutchman or Dutch Catalan in the Spanish campaign .
in that way , we are hoping to gain support in the Netherlands for this new project , the new Constitution .
Mr President , Ireland held two referenda on the Nice Treaty : in the first we voted &apos; No &apos; and in the second we voted &apos; Yes &apos; .
there were many reasons for this , but an overriding one was that our government took its citizens for granted .
the Irish had always voted &apos; Yes &apos; to Europe , so this time they thought it would be the same .
however , on this occasion , the politicians got it wrong .
we have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that , this time , citizens have easy access to all the information they require .
I would go so far as to suggest that every household should receive a copy of the draft Treaty - certainly every household that requests one .
this will be expensive , but it is well worth paying that price .
furthermore , I would very strongly support a suggestion to publish a document outlining , on the one hand , what is already in place in the existing Treaties and , on the other , outlining what is new , changed or different .
unlike the assertions from some speakers in this House today , this is not telling people what to do or how to think ; it is giving our citizens a choice .
if you were sitting a public examination in Ireland , you might be asked to compare and contrast .
this is what we need to do : to assess if what we now have is an improvement or otherwise .
in spite of the scathing references of many Eurosceptics , I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the Holy Grail or the Second Coming , but it is a positive step forward for Europe and one that I will support .
I have many reasons for saying this , but time allows me to mention just one today .
this Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens .
for example , a million citizens &apos; signatures can prompt the Commission to draft a proposal .
that is people power !
just imagine the possibilities : citizens from Latvia , Spain , Ireland or Sweden , for example , finding common cause and demanding action .
surely , that is the possibility of a citizens &apos; Europe !
Mr President , there are some things to admire in this Constitution but there are also many things to dislike .
on balance my party has decided that it cannot recommend it to the people of Scotland , and accordingly will not be voting for the report .
we have a number of objections to the Constitution itself , but in the seconds remaining I will simply mention the inadequate subsidiarity provisions .
Scotland is not independent yet , but the Scottish Parliament is already the only body responsible for justice , the environment , education , health and many other areas of Scottish life .
the provisions in this Treaty for incorporating it into the EU law @-@ making process are inadequate .
we have seen in the field of fisheries the disastrous consequences of EU legislation being inadequately sensitive to reality on the ground within the Member States or territories of the Union , and this Constitution will not sufficiently improve EU law @-@ making for Scotland .
more to the point , it does not take account of the dignity of my country .
we cannot recommend it to the people of Scotland and will not be voting for it .
Mr President , I am from a country with a constitution that enshrines the truth about fundamental human rights : the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity ; the truth that a supreme being , not a mere human institution , gave these rights to us - all of us without exception .
in Ireland we have had governments which have neglected or even denied our rights , but under the shelter of our constitution , even the most vulnerable of us can demand them .
the EU Constitution expounds the false position that the EU creates all rights , even fundamental rights .
here , the EU is not the guardian of rights , but the giver .
I would not dream of supporting this Constitution .
it has not grasped the simple and important truth of fundamental human rights .
history tells us that when human institutions become the giver of rights , rights become gifts .
they can be bestowed selectively , denied , or even take back .
I will support the truth that the fundamental rights of the human person are from God .
I will defend the Irish constitution against usurpation .
- Mr President , first of all I believe that we need to express our gratitude to the members of the Convention on the Future of Europe who prepared this Constitution and , at the same time , to congratulate the heads of the Member States who signed the Constitution on 29 October 2004 .
nor should we forget the chairman of the Convention , Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing , whom we need to thank .
I do not intend to repeat everything that has been said in favour of the Constitution or everything that has been written in the rapporteurs &apos; report or everything said by the rapporteurs .
I fully endorse everything that has been said and I congratulate them on the excellent report which they have submitted .
I sincerely congratulate both Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigο .
Τhe text of the Constitution which we are debating is not by any means perfect , as everyone has said .
however , it is the best which there could be under current political circumstances .
it creates a more democratic and more operational Union and makes it more credible and valid both at home and abroad .
the European Union is going down in global history as a union of states which aims to serve values .
man , the European citizen , the individual , stands at the epicentre of the constitutional arrangements .
humanitarian solidarity is also transferred to state level with the provision on the defence of a Member State in the event of attack against it .
it is precisely this solidarity which I emphasise in the amendment which I have tabled and I call on you to vote for it .
the adoption of the Constitution for Europe is a huge step forward .
it is a milestone on the road to the future .
those who do not believe in the European Union will naturally find clever legal excuses for political pretexts to deride the Constitution and they have every right to do so .
however , they should respect one thing : that their governments , all the governments have signed this Constitution .
that is why , irrespective of the reservations and the individual objections which we have , we all need to act and work for the approval of this Constitution , for its ratification by all the Member States
supporting this truly excellent report gives the European Parliament both a great opportunity and a great responsibility to encourage our European fellow citizens to support the European Constitutional Treaty .
our message to the citizens whom we represent here is that the acceptance of the European Constitutional Treaty is a truly exceptional step forward in the development of our common European home and that it is indeed a prerequisite for its progress in all areas .
it is but a step from European diplomacy to European democracy .
if the worst were to happen , and for these or other reasons the agreement were not to be ratified , this would not simply be a case of Europe running in place ; it would be a significant and a dangerous step backwards .
it would endanger our efforts to bring about a future that seeks not only peace , but economic and social progress ; a future in which a democratic Europe will remain an active and influential player on the international political stage .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteurs .
however , I would like to ask for more noise and excitement over the small clause , under &apos; participatory democracy &apos; , that deals with the citizens &apos; right of initiative .
this , above all , makes a reality of bringing Europe closer to its citizens .
it builds on the right to petition , but more than that it is a positive right that allows our citizens to begin to set the agenda .
in my own country , in comparison , citizens have no right of initiative , petitions languish on shelves , legislative initiatives rely on parliamentarians winning a ballot - it is a sort of game of chance - and even then the initiative will probably be talked out by colleagues , with the citizens having no real place .
I am very proud that this nascent EU right offers more : a real opportunity for our citizens to participate in and to move Europe .
let us therefore have a loud fanfare for this step towards direct democracy , European @-@ style .
Mr President , we are all aware that the Constitutional Treaty is bad news .
it is legal nonsense , it is overly complex and it is riddled with ideology .
the thick tomes of several hundred pages are incomprehensible to the average citizen of an EU Member State .
they are written in the spirit of the French Revolution - an enlightened , revolutionary and secular spirit .
there is no room in the Treaty for God or traditional , European , Christian , Roman , Greek and Latin values .
there is no room either for the values that are dear to us , such as the nation , the family , human life , faith and traditions .
these values have been replaced by secular , socialist , stupid and bizarre values , such as the worship of Mother Earth , or rather Gaia , rights for homosexuals and power for Brussels bureaucrats .
this is something we cannot consent to and never will .
the report we are debating is misleading , biased and deceptive .
it is pure propaganda , and only has positive things to say about the Treaty .
where is the truth in all of this ?
you should be ashamed of yourselves !
a biased report full of propaganda has been produced and distributed at the expense of the citizens of the Member States , and it is a stain on the conscience of the European Parliament .
we should be ashamed of ourselves .
the revolution must truly have gone a long way for the truth to be abused in such a fashion .
fortunately , Poland will reject this Treaty , and I hope other countries will follow suit .
the League of Polish Families and the Independence and Democracy Group will vote against the report .
&apos;No &quot; to the Constitutional Treaty !
Mr President , I should like to begin by saying that I cannot agree with the previous speaker .
I should like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the European Convention .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats made a particularly valuable contribution to this Convention , something which as a young MEP I was particularly glad to see .
Mr Teufel , Mr Brok and Mr Wuermeling are names that deserve mention in this connection , but I should like to thank each and every one of the participants for the work they carried out during a period of such crucial importance for the future of Europe .
I found it all the more regrettable that the Council , not long after the Convention had completed its democratic work , used an urgent procedure to revise its outcome to bring it into line with its wishes .
it is unfortunate that the democratic nature of the Convention &apos;s work was somewhat tarnished as a result of this .
nevertheless , I support the Constitution and do not believe that it requires detailed explanations , as the previous speaker said , but that it creates a clear , transparent and more citizen @-@ friendly Europe .
if I may go into detail on one point , I believe that one aspect of the Constitution which represents major progress is the fact that cooperation between the European Parliament , on the one hand , and the national parliaments , on the other , will improve our contacts with the national parliaments , and enable us to gain a more detailed idea of how the legislation for which we often merely lay down the framework is transposed directly in the nation states .
particularly helpful in this regard is the fact that we have a clear delineation of competences between national and European levels , and the early @-@ warning system for subsidiarity monitoring will also have a positive impact .
I therefore hope that regulation of a clearer and more transparent structure of competences , and the early @-@ warning system for subsidiarity monitoring , will allow us to achieve more effective and better cooperation with our national colleagues , in order to make legislation in Europe even more transparent .
Mr President , any community in which the separation of powers is not stipulated and the security of rights is not guaranteed needs a Constitution .
that was stated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 .
we have wished to follow the path which more than two centuries ago led to the freedom of people and peoples and , therefore , through this Constitution we will have more and better Europe .
through this Constitution we are restoring the impetus of the Maastricht Treaty , we are overcoming the failure of the Treaty of Nice and we are bringing enlargement and further Europeanisation together , in real time .
naturally , through this Constitution , the Union will have more legitimacy , more values , more rights , more democracy and more efficiency in terms of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ; the European Security and Defence Policy ; the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice ; and also social Europe .
I would like to stress the support of the European Confederation of Trade Unions for the European Constitution , which I believe to be truly essential and fundamental .
this Constitution will have to be improved and , of course , applied and developed ambitiously when the time comes .
no Constitution is perfect , but no Constitution can be improved unless it enters into force .
we must therefore achieve its ratification on time and correctly .
and we will do all of this with sufficient majorities to continue moving forward .
this is a citizen &apos;s Constitution which must be perceived as such .
in Spain , on 20 February , we have a date with a referendum , with two good friends : a Constitution and Europe .
we will be there .
Mr President , we face many myths and red herrings as we try to promote the debate on the EU Constitution .
Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo have done an excellent job in their clear and straightforward explanation and advocacy of its merits .
Mr Corbett , I shall probably borrow your wording for a pamphlet in my constituency , but this is in a common good cause .
one of the red herrings put around is whether to call the document a &apos; Constitutional Treaty &apos; or a &apos; constitution &apos; , but , as the authors say , this is a sterile debate .
it is a treaty in form , but a constitution in substance .
why are so many people , at least in my own country , Britain , so frightened of the word constitution ?
every club , every society has one .
in fact the UK itself has one , even though it has never been written down all in one place - unfortunately !
the greatest benefits of the new Constitution are that , on the one hand , it constrains the EU , but on the other , it liberates it .
the powers of the European Union will be constrained by strengthened rules on limits to competence , on parliamentary scrutiny , on democratic accountability and the definition of citizens &apos; rights vis @-@ à @-@ vis the administration .
but the Union will also be freed up to act more effectively on the domestic and external challenges we face .
domestically , this is most striking in the case of justice and home affairs .
we will be able to act more decisively to manage our borders and immigration and to tackle serious crime , as our citizens want us to do .
we will also be able to act more effectively abroad .
what an impact it would have made on our public opinion , as well as on the disaster effort , if it had been , for example , a French aircraft carrier with German helicopters and British marines assisting in Aceh in Indonesia , and not just American ones .
some claim to see in the Charter of Fundamental Rights - which will become legally binding - a threat .
I see it as an opportunity .
the anti @-@ Europeans have to understand that it will sometimes act in the sense of constraining the EU institutions and giving redress against abuse of powers by them .
there is therefore no reason for people to fear and every reason to welcome the Constitution - and indeed this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the draft European Constitution makes the European citizen a major player in the construction of a united Europe .
the draft Constitution will be subject to the approval of our countries .
Hungary and Lithuania have already said yes to it , and that is something about which we are delighted .
in the form of a single document that is more easily readable than the current treaties , the Constitution reaffirms the double legitimacy of a Union of states and of citizens .
the Council of Ministers will reach its decisions on a qualified majority basis in a greater number of areas .
the Presidency of the European Council will be stabilised with a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year term of office .
the Commission will see the number of its members reduced and its coordination strengthened .
externally , the appointment of a European Foreign Minister will finally enable Europe to speak with a single voice outside our common borders .
the drama of the tidal wave in South @-@ East Asia illustrates once again the importance of such visibility and of the increased coordination of European action in the world .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , together with the Commissioner , have detailed the democratic progress represented by the draft European Constitution .
the Constitution will also enable Europeans overseas to assert their particular assets and to contribute to the emergence of an active new European frontier , a showcase for progress in solidarity and diversity .
Europeans have everything to gain from approving the ratification of the European Constitution .
they will become its major proponents and enable the European Union to function better and with more clarity and transparency , while at the same time establishing a balanced and stable distribution of powers at the different levels of decision @-@ making : European , national and regional .
Mr President , following the example of our group , the Belgian Socialist delegation will vote in favour of this report , which gives its support to a document that constitutes an important stage on the road to European integration .
Parliament &apos;s decision will be crucial , democratically and politically , to the debates that will be conducted within the framework of the processes of ratification .
our own decision will be one in favour , even though our &apos; yes &quot; vote will be designed to ring up the curtain , not to ring it down .
in other words , it will be a combative &apos; yes , &quot; which should signal a beginning and not an end .
it will be a decision in the affirmative because , as many of us have pointed out , this Treaty presents significant advances .
how , indeed , can there not be delight about the fact that the Constitutional Treaty grants our Parliament new and increased powers , thereby imposing a democratic debate within the only European institution endowed with the legitimacy of universal suffrage ?
how , too , can there not be agreement to integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the body of the Constitutional Treaty ?
our decision will be &apos; yes , &quot; but a &apos; yes &quot; designed to start the ball rolling and with a price attached .
when it comes to decisions taken by the Council of Ministers , it will not have escaped the attentive reader that , although the double majority rule has been extended , the unanimity rule has been maintained for a number of crucial decisions , including those relating to the social sphere and to taxation .
in the same way , a number of us are alarmed that a Constitution should include , embedded within its wording , a part that is programmatic in nature and with which we cannot all agree .
the document is not perfect .
it will be difficult to progress matters in certain social or fiscal areas , but no more difficult than at present .
what is important is to become aware of the fact that this Constitution is only a stage in European integration .
it is meaningful only if it heralds an ambitious future project in which all European citizens , beginning with the least affluent , can glimpse , and hope for , an improvement in their conditions of life .
more than in terms of the Constitution , the EU will be judged in terms of the subsequent actions that it will , or will not , promote and in terms of the strength and political will with which it responds , or does not respond , to Europeans &quot; hopes of bringing about , or not bringing about , the social Europe , or the Europe of the people .
for us , that must remain the priority .
Mr President , this is a day of celebration for Europe and for the European Parliament .
it has taken over 20 years to construct this Constitution but we are getting close .
I will vote for this report and for the Constitution for three simple reasons .
firstly , this Constitution was prepared in an open and democratic way .
I have been a civil servant for ten years and I have been involved in negotiating three intergovernmental conferences , including the Amsterdam Treaty , the Nice Treaty and this one .
I can guarantee that had this been an intergovernmental conference from beginning to end , we would never have had this Constitution .
but because we had a Convention , we most certainly got one .
secondly , this Constitution is a good thing .
there are 448 reasons for it , all of which are in the Treaty as articles .
there are three key issues : firstly , it makes the European Union more democratic ; secondly , it makes it more effective and , thirdly , it makes it more understandable .
thirdly , I will vote for this report because it is very good .
I urge anyone who has not read it from beginning to end to have a look at it , because it simplifies and clarifies the Treaty in a magnificent way .
I wish to congratulate Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , who are both at present speaking on their mobile phones - I hope they are Nokias ! - on their excellent report .
if I were to bring up just one thing from the Treaty , it would be on external relations .
just reflecting on what happened in Asia , we had had a president , a foreign minister , a common security policy , a defence system , a better crisis management system , then together we would have got much further .
finally , I would urge each and every Member to go home and defend this Treaty .
that is most certainly what I will do .
Mr President , Commissioner Wallström , honoured guests in the gallery , ladies and gentlemen . today &apos;s debate is in my view the most important debate not only of this session but in the history of the Union as a whole .
the Constitutional Treaty is a historic milestone and a particularly emancipating moment for the European Community .
the very fact that , in this plenary session , there are representatives of twenty @-@ five nation @-@ states holding discussions in their own languages is clear proof of an ability to coexist in equality and to respect common values .
on 1 May of last year , you welcomed us , or the great majority of us , here together , and we , or the great majority of us , felt sincerely honoured .
today , we are all deciding together on the adoption of a common primary unified legal framework respecting just those values which have allowed us to enlarge your assembly .
I respect the fact that you waited for us and I personally feel honoured that I am able to cast my vote , because I perceive the Constitutional Treaty as an ethical and moral framework for Europeans , reinforcing our common historical identity , but I also respect the position of individual nation @-@ states and the patriotism of their citizens .
what more important document could we give our citizens ?
indeed , through the Constitution we are also strengthening their influence on political decision @-@ making and making it possible for them to exert closer control .
I have listened carefully to the reservations of the opponents and I should like to say most sincerely that the Constitution is a compromise , but the adoption of compromises is a great feature of all sensible , responsible and tolerant people .
the European Constitutional Treaty opens up new horizons for us and also significantly emancipates the European Union within the framework of international politics .
I believe that , by voting for the Constitutional Treaty , we are sending a clear and positive signal not only to the citizens of the nation @-@ states within Europe , but also to the whole world , a signal of our resolve to live together in peace and solidarity .
- In this Parliament I represent citizens of a state , which has already ratified the European Union Constitution .
on 11 November last year , barely two weeks after its signing in Rome , Lithuania ratified this document , the first European Union Member State to do so .
it is true , the decision was made not in a citizens &apos; referendum , but in one of the last sittings of Parliament before the end of its term .
it is also true that the European Union Constitution was ratified in Lithuania without comprehensive discussions on the provisions of this document , which ought to be known by , or at least familiar to Lithuania &apos;s citizens , above all so that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the European Union Constitution .
why do I believe that it is necessary to vote for the ratification of this Constitution in the European Parliament ?
firstly . yes , until 2009 we can live according to the Treaty of Nice , but it has been clear for a while that the enlarged European Union cannot work effectively without necessary institutional changes , without a new and effective division of function responsibilities amongst the institutions of the European Union , as well as amongst the European Union and Member States , amongst the European Parliament and national parliaments .
the European Union cannot work well without an effective mechanism for the enactment of resolutions , without more active participation by citizens , and without clear and transparent accountability to citizens .
this is as obvious as what is written in the motto of the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett - a grown man cannot wear children &apos;s clothes which he grew out of long ago .
secondly . the European Union is striving to become one of the most competitive regions with the most dynamic development in the world .
I believe that while striving for this goal it is important not only to properly set out the priorities of European Union expansion and to ensure that these receive the necessary funding , but also to see that there is order in the European Union above all from the standpoint of its institutions .
I am about to finish , Mr President .
I would also like a provision about the Christian roots of the European Union to be included in the preamble of the European Union Constitution .
despite the fact that there is no such provision , I will vote for the ratification of this document which is imperfect , but sufficiently good .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , the European Constitutional Treaty is another important step in the development of European integration .
it creates the prerequisites for the European Union , following enlargement , to be able to act as a decisive factor in European development , and , of course , for it also to be able effectively to influence developments in the world .
I see the benefit of the European Constitutional Treaty as being , among other things , that it brings the EU closer to its citizens , extends the rights of EU citizens , enshrines the Charter of Fundamental Rights in primary law , simplifies the legal system and replaces the main European Treaties currently in force with a single text .
the Constitution also reinforces the democratic nature of the Union and strengthens the role of the European Parliament and that of parliaments in the Member States .
it creates the conditions for effective decision @-@ making by the European Union , and also clarifies the powers of the European Union with respect to the Member States .
in addition , it strengthens the EU &apos;s ability to act as a cohesive and unified power in the international community , which is very important in the light of the events in South @-@ East Asia .
for all these and many other reasons , which are too numerous to mention here , social democracies , including the Czech social democracy which I represent here , unequivocally support the draft Constitutional Treaty .
as regards my home country , the Czech Republic , the situation with respect to ratification of the European Constitution is not going to be simple .
the European Constitution is opposed not only by the communists , but also by the conservative right , represented here in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
I should therefore like to invite Mr Poettering and the other leaders of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , for example Mr Karas , whom I can see in the Chamber , to come to the Czech Republic and urge the pro @-@ European Czech forces to ratify the European Constitution .
the Civic Democratic Party , which you have accepted into your ranks , will not do this work for you .
I thank you .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the real world in which we live is far from being a fair world and changes are therefore required to traditional political models .
what is new and fascinating in the European Constitution is the connection between the recognition of a common system of values , democratic values and human rights , and the recognition of a common system of authority .
this notable connection between a project of justice and a method of political sharing is exactly how the great philosopher Immanuel Kant envisaged it .
the European Constitution is therefore an act of both political transformation and moral transformation .
I am sending a letter today to the President of Parliament and to you , Commissioner for institutional relations , suggesting that we set up a TV station constantly broadcasting the work of Parliament and the Council &apos;s future public works to all EU countries .
lastly , I wish to pay tribute to the rapporteurs , Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett .
Mr President , the decisions made by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit have proved to be of still greater significance than anyone had foreseen at that time .
the whole of today &apos;s debate has shown this quite clearly .
what was it that drove the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit ?
it was , in reality , two things .
firstly , they wanted an EU that functioned more efficiently and , secondly , they wanted an EU that could ensure that we too could operate once enlargement had become a reality .
whenever we have altered the methods of European cooperation , this has normally happened as a sealed @-@ off process behind closed doors , following which the population of Europe has woken up one morning to find that leading politicians have once more changed the conditions of cooperation .
that was not , however , the way in which matters proceeded this time .
a Convention was set up , in which I myself had the pleasure of participating .
I think the Convention did some exciting work , but it also set a new objective for how we are to effect changes in Europe in the future .
in future , changes are to be made as part of an open process .
we are now , therefore , presented with a new draft Constitutional Treaty which we need to discuss with the people .
that being said , the following are crucial points I should like to emphasise .
firstly , an integral feature of the new Constitutional Treaty is that it provides us with values concerning not merely democracy and human rights , but also the environment and social responsibility .
secondly , the new Constitutional Treaty provides us with an assurance that the principles of openness and democracy , which a modern @-@ day form of cooperation can be expected to respect , are also applied in European cooperation .
as a Member of the Council of Ministers , I have often wondered at the fact that the population of Europe was not to know how I voted as a minister when we reached the point of taking decisions .
now , we are acquiring a modern , and open , Constitutional Treaty .
finally , we are ensuring that , via the European Parliament , the elected representatives of the people are given greater influence .
all in all , it is a good product that we have debated today and that we are to recommend to the population of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the challenge that Europe must face over the coming months is vital for European integration .
citizens and members of parliaments all across the continent are being called on to adopt a single fundamental Charter which sanctions and strengthens the values upon which this Union is founded : peace , prosperity , democracy , justice , freedom and solidarity .
the new Constitutional Treaty is certainly not everything we had hoped it would be , but its very existence constitutes an unprecedented political and historical event , which was inconceivable until a few years ago .
the text we are to adopt strengthens the democratic legitimacy of the European Institutions and brings them closer to the 450 million men and women who belong to the Union .
indeed , the Constitution confers greater powers on national parliaments and on the European Parliament , in both legislative and political terms : our citizens will also have a greater say in the democratic process thanks to the closer bond between Community institutions and local communities , the social partners and associations .
our duty , as elected representatives , is to make this participation real , productive and tangible .
Europe will thereby consolidate its role as a global player .
this is the main challenge : it is our duty and responsibility to build a Union which can speak with one voice on international issues .
lastly , cultural identity : despite our regret that there is no reference to the Christian roots upon which our Union is undeniably founded , we , as representatives of the Union of Christian Democrats , strenuously support ratification of this text .
the Italian Parliament will ratify the Treaty in the coming weeks ; it will be a positive vote , a vote of encouragement for other countries where the value of Europe is not felt as deeply as it is in Italy .
our country , our government , our party - preserving the legacy of those men who left their mark on and founded Europe - will contribute towards a positive outcome of the ratification process , in order to give full effect to the ideals in which we Christian Democrats have always believed .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on this report , which adds clarity and weight to the debate .
I was one of the 200 parliamentarians who participated in the Convention and produced the Convention text , which the IGC subsequently took on board to a very large degree .
I doubt whether any Member State constitution has ever been prepared in such an open and democratic way .
I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved .
of the 200 parliamentarians participating in that Convention , only eight signed an alternative text , basically arguing for the disintegration of Europe .
we have heard that case being put here this morning , with Mr Allister of Northern Ireland arguing for a reversion to 19th century absolute sovereignty .
if Sinn Féin had participated in the debate this morning they would - although they are the direct political opposites in Northern Ireland - have been making exactly the same case .
perhaps it is a kind of progress that they agree on 19th century absolute sovereignty , although it is unfortunate that they continue to fall out over the outcome of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 !
the fact is that this is a world in which the response to natural disasters and to man @-@ made problems clearly requires transnational governance .
uniquely in the world , Europe is developing a democratic form of transnational governance .
this Constitution will give us more democracy , more rights and more potential for a prosperous society in Europe , and indeed for solidarity with the rest of the world .
to conclude , those outcomes will not happen of their own accord .
we have to work for them , using this Constitution as the basis for our work .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , 2004 was a particularly noteworthy year in the history of European integration , and it had both high and low points .
there can be no doubt that the high points included the enlargement of the Community from 15 to 25 Member States , and the indications given in December 2004 that further enlargements would follow .
another high point was the signing of the Constitution on 29 October in Rome .
it is generally acknowledged , however , that the European elections were a low point , both in terms of their date and their outcome .
turnout for the European elections was lower than ever before , and further evidence for this can be seen in the fragmentation the results caused in this House .
proof of this fragmentation can be found not least in the many colourful flags I see around me , and by no means only in front of the building .
in 2005 , therefore , we must ensure that the public become involved again in the European project , and I do not believe that to be actually such a hard task .
it is , however , an issue of communication .
the product we have - the new European Constitution - is a very good one , and we must win people over to it .
we do not need propaganda campaigns ; instead , we need reliable information , in particular with regard to claims that the Constitution will benefit people .
we should not promise people the moon , but tell them what benefits the Constitution will and can bring .
Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett have summarised this in four key points .
the Constitution will bring greater clarity and greater effectiveness to the European Union , as well as more democracy and accountability and more rights for citizens by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
providing information is not the same thing as refraining from criticism , but the first task for such criticism must be to make it clear that our product is , in principle , a good one .
finally , it has repeatedly been claimed that the public is not interested in a Constitution .
when we held a publicity event at the University of Graz , however , the Constitution met with more interest than toadstools or dream interpretation .
this should be an incentive for us to promote the Constitution to the public .
Mr President , I would like to declare that the Italian socialist delegation will be voting for the Corbett @-@ Méndez de Vigo draft report , and I would extend my congratulations to the rapporteurs on the quality of the report , in particular the explanatory statement .
today the European Parliament has certainly reached an historic milestone , which brings to mind 14 February 1984 when Altiero Spinelli &apos;s draft Treaty , of which the Constitution is in some ways the ideal continuation , was adopted .
it matters little if in strictly legal terms the text is a treaty , but what does matter is the substance : today we are all prepared to call it the Constitution , a term which until just a few years ago was often considered unmentionable .
those like Altiero Spinelli and the Federalist Movement , to which I am honoured to belong , who believed and still believe that it is vital to create a true federal state with few but essential competences that will ensure a role for the European Union in the world , would have wished for a bolder text .
nevertheless , this Constitution contains in essence certain fundamental passages which constitute a stable , lasting framework , on the basis of which we must now move forward so that the Union can effectively do what its citizens expect .
I will only quote a few examples which I consider to be a priority and which in certain cases arise from the link with my region , a cross @-@ border region .
firstly , I would like to mention the establishment of the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs , who is the European Union &apos;s voice on the international stage and who guides its foreign policy .
the procedures which make him , as a member of the Commission , accountable to Parliament are a prerequisite for the existence of a foreign policy .
following the many - too many - conflicts which have characterised recent years , the citizens of Europe are asking us and themselves what Europe is doing .
secondly , the EU must be a model of development , a tangible testament to the fact that it is possible to combine development and solidarity .
lastly , I would like to point out that the principle of subsidiarity is now a constitutional principle and this strengthens and guarantees it .
that is another reason why I believe we must vote for this report .
I support this constitution , however , in my opinion , it is a good thing that in this Parliament we have Members that are against it .
let me say why this is so .
not because I agree with the arguments that they are putting forward , on the contrary I think that many of their arguments are based on mistaken , or even false premises .
but because without anyone opposing it , we will end up having a monotonous debate where everyone would be in favour and where we would have a lack of objective analysis .
there is no better way by which one can win an argument about Europe as when one has the courage to compare the arguments in favour with those against .
we have to take seriously the arguments of whoever is against and treat them with respect .
but we should not be afraid or run away from the arguments of whoever is against , let alone ignore them .
we should not expect to win the argument if we do not expose ourselves to an open debate , otherwise we will end up saying that we have won the game when in fact only one team would have come to play .
after all , when one compares the arguments in favour of this constitution with the arguments against , one will not take long to conclude that the constitution has much more that is good in it than bad and it merits the support of the European citizens .
there is no doubt that if we explain to the people what the constitution means , the people will be more in favour than against it , because they understand how logical is the unification of Europe , that it makes sense and that it is in their interest .
therefore it is of utmost importance that whoever is in this room , whoever in this Parliament is in favour of this constitution , has to commit himself or herself directly with the people to see that they understand it and support it .
this support will be based on the comparison of the arguments and therefore it will be on a more open , more balanced and a more democratic debate .
Mr President , a Constitution for Europe is necessary : it is a democratic requirement .
profoundly attached to the unity of the party , the French Socialists will conduct the national debate without in any way giving up our progressive values and ideas .
I consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing Parliament &apos;s authority in respect of the Constitutional Treaty , but I am sorry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected .
nonetheless , we shall be part of this long and treacherous process that is the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty .
we state that this Constitutional Treaty is stable but capable of being modified .
that is the case with all constitutions , and with this Treaty no less than with others .
we also regret the fact that a large majority of the opinions issued by other parliamentary committees that have identified a host of shortcomings in the Constitutional Treaty have been left out of this report .
we are also keen to state clearly that a special unit , established under the Dutch Presidency , will continue with its work under the future Presidencies and will carefully scrutinise all the possible consequences of the Constitution &apos;s being rejected .
I want Parliament , legitimised in its role following this vote , to get to grips with the difficulties of implementing the Constitutional Treaty and to use its parliamentary right of initiative .
that is what we are called upon to do , and it is what Amendment No 17 is all about .
yes , it is incumbent upon ourselves as MEPs and elected representatives of the European people to take a proactive role in implementing the Constitutional Treaty , which governs the corporate life of more than 450 million Europeans .
the difficulties revealed by the opinions of the other committees will resurface sooner or later .
we must therefore be prepared to correct the imperfections bequeathed by the Intergovernmental Conference when it altered the delicate balance achieved wisely and equitably by the Convention .
let us prepare ourselves , ladies and gentlemen , for a new round .
it is , indeed , going to be necessary to defend our popular legitimacy in respect of the Constitutional Treaty , whose shortcomings we have an absolute duty to correct when the time is right .
a number of my colleagues in the French delegation will abstain from voting on this report .
Mr President , this Constitutional Treaty is worth upholding .
as a Christian Democrat , I am pleased that the subsidiarity principle has just been further worked out , deepened and anchored .
the European Union has now also recognised and enshrined the task of the regional dimension , namely local and regional authorities .
there is a need for a better balance to be struck between what happens at the centre and away from it , in Brussels , in the nation states and in regions and municipalities .
as a governor at regional level , I noticed for years that EU information remained at Council level for too long and that regions and towns were involved in the debate and decision @-@ making too late .
as a representative of the European organisations , I was also able to attend hearings of the Convention , particularly those about subsidiarity .
the Treaty text reinforces the position of regions and towns , which are close to the citizens and where important tasks are carried out in many areas .
in that way , the democratic loophole , which Mr Prodi mentioned in his report on good governance , is closed once more .
it is an important step that the European Parliament supports this and remains critical about the way in which this Treaty will be fleshed out at local or regional level in the next few years .
I would also suggest that we in this House from time to time ask the Council and the Committee of the Regions whether , among other things , our national states have now learned to communicate openly about European policy , and whether , in the subsidiarity test , national parliaments take the opinions of regions and towns into consideration .
I know that the Committee of the Regions is developing a similar test .
in short , this Treaty is well worth upholding .
consequently , we will labour for this cause at national level , certainly if referendums are on the agenda .
- Mr President , the major risks from this Constitution are three in number .
the first is , are we to become a federation , a federation both on foreign affairs and in defence and elsewhere , or are we to be a Europe of a loose federation of dissimilar partners , especially after enlargement ?
the second is , are we to be a Europe of social awareness or are we to be a Europe of the open , uncontrolled market ?
the third is , are we to be a Europe without a democratic deficit , with power in the hands of the citizens , or are we to be a Europe in which European elections are held and we have abstentions of 70 , 60 or 50 % ?
in my opinion , this Constitution answers all these questions most positively , in all events much more positively than they are addressed under current treaties .
anyone against this Constitution , allegedly for reasons of social sensitivity , needs to answer the question of whether the existing treaties help the poor and the weak in Europe more than this Constitution helps them .
allow me an element of minor national pride as a Greek and as a socialist : it was during the Greek Presidency , in June 2003 , that the initial negotiations on this Constitution were concluded , and I am proud of that .
of course , it now remains to be applied and this is where the MEPs and the governments have a huge responsibility .
we need to ensure that the seeds of social awareness sown in the Constitution do not remain pretty words and are put into practice .
the famous social mainstreaming clause setting out the Union &apos;s obligation to ensure that its every policy promotes the objectives of high employment , environmental protection , public health , education and equality between men and women can only be applied under good laws .
similarly , I must tell you that , for any MEPs striving for a socially fairer Europe , this is a particularly painstaking and particularly welcome challenge .
for many people , the institutions in Brussels seem remote .
they see them as centres of power where decisions are made over which they have no influence .
the Constitutional Treaty is not a miracle cure for all the problems of the European Union , but it is an opportunity to reduce democratic shortcomings and to speed up Europe &apos;s development .
why ?
because it replaces numerous agreements and amendments , thereby reducing the lack of transparency in key European Union documents ; because in a single document it brings together the key constitutional and legal foundations and policies of the European Union ; because it is the basis for more effective functioning of European institutions ; because it contributes to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy ; because it removes the problems that would arise were the current agreements to continue to be used in the future .
the Constitutional Treaty is a compromise that does not completely satisfy anyone , but it nonetheless most represents what we have been able to achieve in the convention .
we need the Constitutional Treaty because without it we cannot expect any effective reforms or effective functioning in the enlarged Europe .
although the chapter on policies has frequently been criticised , as a shadow rapporteur I must express my satisfaction that in the area of social policy and employment very concrete commitments have been set out for the Commission and the governments of the Member States , including the establishment of a Committee for Social Protection and European Social Harmony .
by accepting the report on the Constitutional Treaty , the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the people of Europe that the time has come for a transparent and wholesale rearrangement of our constitutional and legal foundations , thereby ensuring that Europe becomes a continent of peace , prosperity , solidarity and security .
finally I should mention that the Slovenian parliament will ratify the Constitutional Treaty this month .
I am convinced that it will do so by a large majority .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I reject totalitarian regimes .
my grandmother &apos;s family died in the Nazi gas chambers . my father was incarcerated by the communist regime .
we have paid in blood for our commitment to the freedom of conscience , which was embodied for us by Europe as a hope for democracy , freedom of thought , religious freedom and freedom of conscience .
I believe that none of you would consider me to be anti @-@ European if I were to pose a few questions .
why is the European Parliament pronouncing on the Constitutional Treaty before the citizens of the individual states ?
do we need Europe to be governed by a constitution ?
the sovereignty of Member States should not be threatened .
if , however , the Constitution strengthens the role of Parliament , but does not define the competences of the European Court of Justice , will the balance between institutions thus be upset ?
decisions of the Court will be directly imposed on Union bodies and Member States without any right of appeal .
the European Court of Justice will be free from any criticism .
can we pretend that this will not happen ?
the draft Constitution contains no guarantees that the European Court of Justice will not appropriate some of the exclusive competences of the sovereign states , even contrary to national constitutions .
even if the majority in this Parliament changes after the elections and the composition of the Council changes , a double unanimity will be required in order to change policies .
and I just wonder : will such a Union be capable of development if its direction is set by this Constitution ?
our civilisation has developed from Christian roots .
if the Constitution fails to acknowledge this historical fact , unrest will be introduced into the life of society .
a new ideology will rise up under a mask of tolerance .
are we to build the European home on a distortion of history ?
is it true that , without this Constitution , the concept of a united Europe will die ?
I think not .
my voters have put their faith in me and I wish to proceed in Europe so that everyone , including the smallest , weakest and poorest , are accepted into it and can find their places in it .
ladies and gentlemen , in a democratic Europe , I ask that we respect the freedom of conscience when voting .
Mr President , despite all the differences of opinion which the debate surrounding this issue has produced , we are once again making European history .
as such , this Treaty is an important step in the right direction .
I am certain that the founders of the movement for European integration would be proud and pleased if they were now witnessing just how many fundamental issues have resulted in such compromises that Parliament is now debating and voting on them .
it is unfortunate that in some countries the debate on the Treaty has been taken out of context and used to fuel an internal and party political row .
the worst features of Europeanisation , intolerance and jingoism , are all too often visible and audible at such times , although attempts are made to conceal them in the form of lies disguised as loftier aspirations .
when this Treaty has come into force , there is no chance that it will lead to the creation of a European superstate : on the contrary , its spirit and text will effectively block any self @-@ seeking aspirations on the part of states , groups of states or extremist movements .
the Treaty will still allow the economy to play the role best suited to it in cooperation within the continent .
the dynamics of mutual economic activity and the single monetary policy are also preconditions of political cooperation .
without democracy there is no social dimension , and there is no democracy without a market economy .
I am also proud that in my own country , Finland , we have been able to agree that Parliament can decide on the ratification of the Treaty at national level .
while approving the report submitted , I would like to reiterate once more that Lithuania , on the decision of its Parliament , was the first to ratify this Constitution .
after the recent elections , Lithuania &apos;s social democrats , who were and remain in power , took an active part in the task of preparing the Constitutional Treaty .
when countries were invited to set down in legal terms the things which after deliberation all generally agreed on , we did this without delay .
we had good grounds for this .
in a referendum held a year and a half ago , Lithuanians gave the clearest &apos; Yes &quot; to European Union membership of all the new Members .
support in Lithuania for European Union membership continues to grow and has reached 82 % .
people see that the hopes associated with the European Union are being fulfilled , and so they want to strengthen it .
the failure of a referendum on the Constitution in any country of the European Union would , I believe , be a painful blow to the hopes of the majority of Europeans , among them Lithuanians .
today the European Union ship already contains 25 states , but is sailing with far too weak an engine for such a cargo - the Treaty of Nice .
if it is not replaced with a much more powerful one - the engine of the Constitutional Treaty - our common ship will reduce speed and may begin to drift .
with the old Nice engine we will never achieve the goals defined in the Lisbon strategy , and we will be unable to implement new neighbour policies effectively .
this is particularly relevant to the new European Union countries .
a strong democratic European Union moving forward - this is essential , not just in the interest of our country .
the Constitutional Treaty - no matter how complicated a compromise it might be - contributes to this .
Lithuania ratified it with resolve , so that the energy and optimism of the new countries might be passed on to the European Union &apos;s old @-@ timers .
thank you .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that this substantial report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo has been tabled .
as a former substitute member of the Convention , I must admit that I might recommend to some people that they read this report rather than the Constitution itself , as it is supremely readable and extremely convincing on the issue .
today I should like to address my comments to those Members of this House who have taken a critical approach to the Constitution .
they have warned against the creation of a European superstate and denounced shortcomings , and they have come out in opposition to mistakes made in the past .
I believe we should make it very clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of addressing these shortcomings .
the European Constitution remedies many of the problems that all of us have experienced with Europe as it exists today .
it lays down a system of competences and grants national parliaments the right of participation , thus making Europe less centralist and less bureaucratic .
the Constitution gives the European Parliament a full say , and Europe will therefore become more democratic than it has been to date .
it also strengthens citizens &quot; rights , above all by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as citizens will be able to invoke the Constitution directly when appealing against European decisions .
finally , the Constitution provides this Europe of ours with a basis of values , and is thus a way of countering the technocratic approach to political problems .
the Eurosceptics should therefore really be in favour of this Constitution , as it is the only way of changing the things we all wish to change .
today is the anniversary of the birth of Alexander Hamilton , one of the fathers of the American Constitution , whose picture can today be found on ten @-@ dollar notes .
as I look at the fathers and mothers of the European Constitution in this House , I hope that they will also be remembered as gratefully in 200 years &quot; time .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs on a very thorough report .
this document summarises exceptionally well the most essential points of the European Constitution .
at the same time , I would like to see a slightly different emphasis regarding the publicising of the Constitution .
in its conclusions , today &apos;s report concentrates on printed materials about the Constitution .
however , public surveys and common logic tell us that European citizens primarily look for and receive information via television , including information about the EU .
today &apos;s report stresses the need to clearly distinguish every point in the Constitutional Treaty that differs from existing treaties .
this , however , is more a topic for academic research rather than information to be relayed to every European citizen .
the 300 @-@ page Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is voluminous enough as it is , and consequently also more complex than the constitutions of the Member States .
there is no common European public opinion yet , but in my home country Estonia , for example , support for the EU has grown with every month since Estonia &apos;s accession .
at the same time support is falling in many Member States .
nevertheless , the same rule applies both in journalism and in public information throughout Europe : people must be given what they want .
in old and new Member States , in cities and in the country , people are primarily interested in what effect the European Constitution will have on their everyday life .
I believe that in presenting the Constitution , we should concentrate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
for instance , what does the right to good administration stipulated in the Charter mean for each citizen ?
to what extent will such a requirement force bureaucrats or politicians to justify their decisions , or to be open ?
answers to questions such as these should be an integral part of public information about the Constitution .
also , in conclusion , I would say that there can be no talk of informing the citizens of Europe if television is not included .
the Parliament &apos;s Directorate @-@ General for Information should take this into account in its efforts to publicise the Constitution .
I wish them and all the European television networks success in translating the Constitution &apos;s complex wording into a palatable format for the public .
thank you .
- Mr President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is of historic importance .
the significant progress being made with the European Constitution and the advantages which derive from its positive provisions have already been presented both in the full report by my honourable friends Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo and today in this Chamber .
as , therefore , almost all the issues have been exhausted , I shall confine myself to one vital problem .
a new marathon starts from tomorrow for ratification by the Member States .
but what will happen if there is some problem with ratification by some Member State ?
the Constitution does not contain a specific provision to deal with this eventuality .
nonetheless , the declarations relating to the provisions of the Constitution state that , if two years after signature of the Constitution , 4 / 5 of the Member States have ratified the Constitution in question and one or more Member States are facing difficulties in connection with ratification , the matter will be submitted to the European Council .
do you , however , think that this arrangement is satisfactory ?
I believe that there should be a much clearer provision .
unfortunately , however , this arrangement also emerged from the series of compromises which were necessary in order for us to get where we are today .
therefore , it is not enough for us to talk and to support the ratification of the Constitution unreservedly .
all the governments and all of us need to work to avoid such an unfortunate development if we want to enter a new era for our continent .
- Mr President , by adopting the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mèndez de Vigo , Parliament will be making its last major contribution towards the adoption of a constitutional Treaty for Europe .
the existence of such a Treaty will enshrine the historic transition from a Community of peoples and countries progressively united by ever @-@ closer economic ties to an actual political Community united by the desire for a common future .
fifty years of a policy of small , prudent steps has paved the way for a new reality based on shared values , civilised values that express a shared European identity based on peace , democracy , human rights and economic and social progress .
Europe is not being built at variance with the secular reality of the nations on our continent .
Europe is founded upon the free and informed desire to ensure that the past does not repeat itself and to provide its peoples with guarantees that they will remain masters of their own destiny in a future laden with challenges .
the champions of sovereignty , who accuse Europe of eroding national sovereignty and who see in this Constitution their nightmare of a superstate coming true , are profoundly mistaken in their analysis .
economic , financial and technological globalisation , the current or potential emergence of new global , political and economic potentates , have forced Europe to seek responses at national level to defend , deepen and export the humanist project initiated in the last century by the post @-@ war social state under the rule of law .
in a world that is characterised by uncertainty , disorder and deregulation , it is increasingly necessary for Europe to speak out and to play an active role , both for us and for those others who look to us to set an example and to take action on matters of major international importance .
the champions of sovereignty are not the only opponents of this Treaty .
others have loudly criticised it for not going far enough , for the fact that results have been meagre or for its lack of ambition .
such people refuse to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made , because they persist with the pointless exercise of comparing the constitutional Treaty before us to the idealised versions of their dreams instead of comparing it to the current Treaties and the Nice process , in particular .
Mr President , while the European Parliament has no formal role in the ratification procedure , I am pleased that , as the elected representatives of 25 Member States of the European Union , we are having this debate today , at a point in time when the ratification procedure has just got under way at parliamentary level and is just about to get under way at referendum level .
on the day when heads of state and government signed the Constitution in Rome , I happened to be in Bratislava , Slovakia , where I was privileged to participate in the opening of the House of Europe .
that was the first opening of a House of Europe in one of the new Member States .
it was followed by the opening in December of a House of Europe in Prague .
procedures for establishing Houses of Europe in all Member States are under way .
the principal function of these Houses of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens .
they offer citizens a point of information that is centrally and visibly located in their own Member State .
the concept offers education on the European Union and , by providing accommodation for the political groups , it ensures that the views of this Parliament can be conveyed to the citizens .
it is my belief that if the European Union is to work , we have to strengthen and deepen the relationships between this Parliament and the national parliaments .
there is no other way in which we can achieve that cooperation in the longer term .
it should not be an &apos; us and them &apos; situation ; it should be about everyone working together for the betterment of all people in the 25 Member States - or perhaps the 27 Member States , should that come about .
that is the challenge for the future ; that is the challenge that we , as democrats , have to take on board .
it takes two sides to make a debate .
because people do not necessarily agree with every word that others say , this does not mean that they have no right to say it .
I believe in the rights of everyone , I believe in democracy .
I believe that those who disagree with me have a right to their views .
the majority will ultimately win , but those who disagree can make this a better debate , and they should be encouraged to do so and should not be disenfranchised from their position .
Mr President , as this report demonstrates very well , there are three basic aspects to the draft Constitution : firstly , the Union &apos;s values and objectives , the unity and equality of its peoples , as well as the protection of the diversity of its cultures , identities and languages ; secondly , the rights , interests and duties of the citizens ; and , thirdly , the rules for the institutions and for European political life .
the first two aspects - values and rights - define the European democracy we want , based on the diversity and freedom of the peoples , their progress and equality .
the third aspect - this should be made clear : the rules of play - is the result of compromises between Left and Right , between federalists and intergovernmentalists ; it should be made clear that it refers to those rules , not to the policies to be implemented .
in this respect , the Constitution is not a final destination , but a departure point , with a view to overcoming Europe &apos;s socio @-@ economic lethargy , its lack of capacity for innovation , research and development and its insufficient weight on the international stage .
we must move forward towards a European Government , moving beyond the currently predominant method of intergovernmental coordination with all its impotence , as demonstrated by the failure to implement the Lisbon strategy and the divisions over the invasion of Iraq .
with this view towards future progress , we shall call for a vote in favour of the European Constitution .
Mr President , a long @-@ standing dream of this Parliament , and one shared by many of Europe &apos;s citizens , is becoming reality .
we have worked long and hard for this Constitution , but we can be proud of what has now been achieved , and I should like to take this opportunity today to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett .
as shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Agriculture , I can say that we are in favour of this draft Constitution , which undoubtedly represents a gain for the committee .
when the common agricultural policy was established in 1958 , this House was merely a consultative body , and it was only with the Treaty of Amsterdam that we were given the right of codecision in the fields of the environment , consumer protection and food safety .
the democracy deficit , having persisted in spite of everything , will now be overcome by means of an extension of the codecision procedure to include all decisions of principle on agricultural policy .
there are however also negative sides to the Constitution .
in future the Council will be able to take autonomous decisions on the setting of quotas , prices and quantitative restrictions , as the draft Constitution takes no account of the new goals of the common agricultural policy following the EU agricultural reform .
this is a step backwards from the current situation , and it will mean much work for us in the future .
as a representative of the German Federal of Baden @-@ Württemberg , too , I believe that a number of extremely important goals have been achieved ; the national constitutions have been strengthened , regions and local authorities have been accorded greater significance , and the principle of subsidiarity has been adhered to .
the draft Constitution lays the foundations for common economic activities , and we will gain a common basis of values shared by all of us , something I see as particularly important .
we have before us a document which places an obligation on all those who bear responsibility for Europe .
Mr President , I am very much in favour of the European Constitution , and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their outstanding report .
the Constitution , which above all strengthens the area of freedom , security and justice , marks a milestone on the road to a more secure and just Europe .
we have taken a giant step towards a Europe of citizens with this Constitution , as by enshrining in it the Charter of Fundamental Rights , by EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and by simplified access to justice , citizens &quot; rights have been given an enormous boost .
in addition , we now have increased opportunities to coordinate our efforts in the fight against such evils as crime , racism and xenophobia in Europe .
I welcome the fact that the members of the CSU in this House will vote in favour of this report .
unfortunately , many members of the CSU in the German , which has yet to ratify the Treaty , appear to have no inkling of the significance and implications of the Constitution , as they have announced their intention to vote against it .
this is yet another example of the double game which the CSU is so fond of playing , which involves being progressive here in Europe and flying the flag for the benefit of the outside world , but speaking out in opposition at home , just in case .
this is , however , one of their traditions , for it was the CSU that , in 1949 , voted against Germany &apos;s Basic Law .
ladies and gentlemen : the trappings of the European Union have become too small , and no longer suit it in its new , expanded form .
therefore it is fitting that the new Constitution will replace agreements that are currently in force and will lead to more effective functioning of the European Union .
it will also strengthen the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments , and thereby the voice of the citizens of the European Union .
as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education , I particularly support the articles of the Constitution that relate to those areas .
I believe that it is important that the preamble emphasises the significance of Europe &apos;s cultural tradition , Europe &apos;s humanistic legacy and the values that define the essence of Europe and its citizens .
one of our greatest objectives is respect for our rich cultural and linguistic diversity , and concern for the protection and development of the European cultural legacy .
the Constitution guarantees freedom for art and science , the right to education and professional training , equal rights for men and women , and the right of the handicapped to be full members of society .
Article 92 guarantees the safety of young people at work , and Article 93 states that the family should enjoy legal , economic and social security .
the articles as written form a good basis for their implementation , but in spite of this the European Union must do much more than simply accept and ratify the Constitution .
above all , it must create the conditions under which the family is recognised as something precious and young married couples have the opportunity to create and nurture a family .
if we use immigration as the principal means of solving demographic problems , this will jeopardise our cultural legacy , the languages of Europe , our culture , our faith , the European Union and European civilisation in general - in short , all the values that we wish to preserve and strengthen through the Constitution .
because we in the 25 Member States have opted for this community , it is also fitting that we do everything we can to ensure that it functions as well and effectively as possible .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and express my full support for the report we are debating today .
tomorrow this House will express its support for the text which concludes a process of creating a constitution which has been ongoing for several decades .
however , our work cannot stop here .
we still have to face the most difficult challenge : its approval and ratification by the European citizens .
without their support , the Constitution makes no sense .
as the honourable Members are well aware , we Spanish have a particular responsibility within this process , since the first referendum amongst European citizens will be held in my country on 20 February .
we all , therefore , have the responsibility of explaining the constitutional text to the European citizens , which in my case includes those Spaniards living outside of Spain and even outside of the European Union .
I am , therefore , pleased that in my country the majority of political parties , unions and other representatives of civil society agree with us and are fully involved in this task of creating awareness of the content and scope of the Constitution , which is the only way to ensure broad participation and a positive response to this historic task .
Mr President , the road to this Constitutional Treaty was a long and rocky one , and a number of good proposals fell by the wayside .
now , though , we need this Constitution , and ratification by the Member States must progress quickly .
the founding fathers , including Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer , laid the foundations for the European house .
their successors built the walls , bought the shelves and filled these shelves with files .
the contents of this house are now piling up to the roof , and we face the immense task of clearing out this house and making it fit for the future .
this is what the European Constitution will help us to do , and it represents a compromise which will mean greater openness and tangible improvements for the European public .
existing Community legislation will be set out in a Treaty , which will make Europe easier to understand .
the common trade policy will play an exemplary role in future in representing our internal market to the outside world , and the enlarged Union &apos;s capacity to act will be strengthened by a smaller Commission and by a new EU Foreign Minister .
citizens will gain more rights , and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as drafted by Roman Herzog , will be enshrined in the Constitution .
the European Parliament &apos;s role will be strengthened ; it will elect the President of the Commission .
it is to be hoped that in future leading politicians from European parties will stand for this post .
the Constitutional Convention allowed us too to bring our influence to bear on the Constitution , and Europe will not become a centralist monster state , but will instead be constructed according to the principle of subsidiarity .
the characteristic approach and principles of the largest group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , can also be seen in the Constitution , although unfortunately we did not succeed in pushing through all of our amendments , for some of which we fought bitterly .
to give but two examples , I regret deeply that no reference to God has been included , and that the formulas for qualified majority voting in the Council are so complicated .
I would however hope for all our sakes that this Convention is a foundation upon which we can continue to build Europe , and that this Europe will be one of peace , freedom and prosperity .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to express my gratitude towards the honourable Members Mr de Vigo and Mr Corbett for an excellently prepared document , quite simply it is clear and highlights the most significant issues .
ladies and gentlemen , the drafting of the Constitution is in line with the situation which has developed historically in modern @-@ day Europe and which currently exists in the world .
irrespective of our will , globalisation processes are occurring throughout the world , but initially in goods and capital movements , that is to say , in the realm of material values .
the exchange of spiritual and moral values is taking place far more slowly .
I believe that one of the reasons for conflicts in many places throughout the world today is largely due to the great disproportion and imbalance between the global exchange of material and spiritual values .
the new Constitutional Treaty is a step towards reducing this disproportion .
this Treaty will not only help us understand more clearly who we are and where we are going , but will also provide greater clarity to our partners throughout the world as to our aims and the values which guide our actions .
therefore , I repeat that this Constitution is well timed and necessary , despite certain shortcomings .
one such shortcoming , which Mr Poettering and other honourable Members have already referred to , is that it contains no reference to Christian values .
ladies and gentlemen , we may or may not admit it , but we are Christians , atheists , Muslims or of other faiths .
what we call common European values have evolved for centuries and are based on Christian values .
ladies and gentlemen , all of us , including those who have participated in the drafting of the Constitution and those who have participated in the analysis and discussions , have an obligation to explain the significance of this document to the citizens of our countries , as we cannot expect every European Union citizen to have read it .
unfortunately I should like to warn against the trend seen in the Member States , whereby the Treaty is often used for short @-@ term discussions on domestic policy .
ladies and gentlemen , let us refrain from this temptation and discourage our party members from doing likewise .
this is a long @-@ term document , which we , our children and also our neighbours need .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that today the Constitutional Treaty - the European Constitution - is becoming a reality .
the result of the Convention &apos;s work , on which we are to vote tomorrow , shows the will to introduce more democracy , transparency and efficiency into the European Institutions , strengthening them and making the decision @-@ making process more efficient .
the citizens are the real winners , since the Constitution consolidates our common values and principles .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which the European Union has also published in miniature version - just like all of the most precious books in history - has been incorporated into the Constitutional Treaty .
in my opinion , this is a fundamental sign of the transparency , solidarity and democracy of rights : the rights of the individual , of children , the elderly and disabled people .
this time these principles are being adopted precisely to bring our institution closer to the people , to put it amidst the people , so that we can provide the answers they particularly need precisely at this time .
I therefore think that removing society &apos;s barriers to ensure that citizens can participate fully in our united Europe is the most important aspect of our current activities .
Mr President , the last thing I want to do is to spoil a party .
over the next 48 hours this Parliament will spend hundreds of thousands of euro on celebrating the Constitution .
we shall have balloons , a laser display , an orchestra ; but I cannot help feeling that all this is a touch premature .
in at least ten countries there must be a referendum before ratification .
we cannot call the result of those polls with certainty .
not a single ballot has yet been cast .
if it were only the party that was premature , it would be rather curmudgeonly of me to object , but we are anticipating the Constitution in other more important ways .
we are , for example , pushing ahead with the creation of an EU diplomatic service , a proposal which , pending formal ratification , has no legal basis .
in the field of justice and home affairs we have gone even further , pre @-@ empting many of the Constitution &apos;s clauses , in particular those to do with the creation of a pan @-@ European legal system and a European public prosecutor .
before the Constitution had even been signed , let alone ratified , the European Court of Justice had indicated that it would treat the Charter of Fundamental Rights as justiciable .
asked formally by this House what parts of the Constitution they intended to implement without waiting for official ratification , only five of the current Commissioners answered that it would be wrong to anticipate the results of the national referendums .
the other 20 all replied in one way or another that they intended to forge ahead at once without waiting for the outcome of the national ballots .
this is meant to be a democratic chamber , but its attitude sometimes recalls Bertolt Brecht &apos;s famous couplet &apos; Let us dismiss the people and elect another in their place &apos; .
I hope my country will vote &apos; no &apos; to the Constitution and I am campaigning to that end , but if I lose , I shall accept the result with good grace .
I would urge those of you who support the Constitution to display a similar respect for the democratic process and not to try to implement large parts of this Constitution even if one or more Member States has voted against it .
no means no .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by addressing the citizens of Europe , and urging them to care about the Constitution .
we must do everything in our power to ensure that the European public accepts this Constitution , because it will make Europe clearer and more citizen @-@ friendly , transparent and democratic .
my impression is that we are all in far too much of a hurry to get down to business as usual .
the Constitution is on the table , but it has not yet been ratified .
it is a political milestone for the European Union , and for a more citizen @-@ friendly , transparent and democratic European Union .
so far , though , the Constitution has been a PR disaster , and I should therefore like to warn that we need an information and communication plan for all the European institutions , the Member States and the national parliaments , and we need a European Constitution Week in all the Member States .
we also need to abolish unanimity in the Council , thus strengthening the common , transparent and democratic Europe as provided for in the Constitutional Treaty .
I would call on the Heads of States or Government to ensure that it is the spirit of the Convention and of the signing ceremony in Rome which sets the tone of domestic political debate , and not a lack of criticism and discussion , or aloofness and indifference .
what we need is for the debate on the Constitution to be Europeanised , not for the ratification process to be nationalised .
the Constitution is not merely a code of practice for the EU institutions ; it affects all Europe &apos;s citizens .
we should however be fully aware that work will begin afresh with tomorrow &apos;s vote .
all that this vote must therefore do is to send out a clear signal .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo , who really have produced a masterpiece , making the Constitution more readable .
the ancient Roman jurists used to say : &apos; &quot; ( the law arises out of the fact ) .
well , from the first day that Europe &apos;s founding fathers began to dream , began to imagine this common entity - a single entity drawing together millennia of history , geography , society and common values - well , from that moment the founding fathers themselves thought of having common rules : what we today call the Constitution .
this is why I am extremely disappointed this morning to hear prominent fellow Members , whose freedom of expression I clearly respect , stating their opposition to the draft Constitution .
people may oppose this form of Constitution or the content of the Constitutional Treaty , but not common rules , since the establishment of these rules strengthens sovereignty .
today we have to reach an agreement in a world undergoing fundamental changes , including with regard to its systems and new semantics : those whose idea of sovereignty is as it was conceived in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are mistaken .
today the new concept of sovereignty lies in subsidiarity : it is the sovereignty of local identities , the sovereignty of citizens , the sovereignty of those who must help construct a legal system to interpret in the best possible way the ever more varied and complex needs of an evolving society .
we cannot conceive of using the terminology which the jurists taught us : federal state , confederal state , sovereign state : Europe is a new entity , a Union , precisely , with which we must all identify .
lastly , I would like to express my regret at the lack of a reference , not just to our Christian roots , but also to Periclean democracy - the origin of the very essence of democracy - to the Roman Empire and to Carolingian Europe .
let us hope that during the process of European integration these things will be remembered .
almost 50 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome , that established the European Economic Union , finally Europe is going to have its own constitution .
for the first time , 450 million citizens and 20 nations are going to be united by this document that defines the values and principles of this European Union .
the ratification of this constitution will lead us to a more democratic Europe .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights was introduced in this constitution and thus the rights of each person are listed and every citizen may invoke this charter whenever he or she thinks that his or her rights have been broken .
the social rights are also a priority and are so by a legal decree , the right to education , the right that every citizen can have access to information , protection in the case of an unjust expulsion and the right that the requests for a review in the case of discrimination on the basis of class can be sanctioned , all have been defined and can be implemented .
the role of the European Parliament has therefore been greatly strengthened and the Parliament together with the Council is going to be responsible to ratify almost all the documents .
the role of the national Parliaments will be strengthened as well , and this is because it will be responsible to oversee that any agreement between the European Union and the Member States is respected , and therefore the national Parliaments will have enough power to put pressure on the European Commission so that it can revise its proposals .
in other words , the European Constitution will help so that we can have a more efficient Europe .
Europe , that has been built in stages , and that is based on Treaties that have been agreed upon along the years ; from now onwards we will really have one Europe .
the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the clear recognition of European values and objectives are now giving us the opportunity , as European citizens , to call this document &apos; The European Constitution &apos; .
I am going to vote in favour .
I appeal my colleagues to do likewise for the good of European citizens .
.
Mr President , in responding to this debate I wish to begin by thanking all those who paid tribute to the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the report it produced .
it is clear that this Constitution has very broad support across the political spectrum and across Member States .
I am hopeful that in the vote tomorrow there will be at least a two @-@ thirds majority in favour of it , with more than 400 votes in favour in this Parliament , and that will send a powerful signal .
let me also respond to the criticisms that have been made of the Constitution .
they seem to be twofold .
firstly , there are those who say they oppose the Constitution because it does not go far enough .
they say it will certainly make the EU more democratic , social and so on , but not enough so .
my answer to them is that the choice at the moment is between the new Constitution and the old one - our current Treaties .
if the new Constitution contains improvements , then it is better to take the new Constitution rather than carry on living with the old one .
that is an argument I would also put to those who complain that there is no reference to Christianity in the new Constitution .
there is no such reference in the current Treaties , although they were drafted by Saint Schuman .
however , the new Constitution contains a reference to our religious heritage and other heritages , and its values are Christian values and also the values of many others .
they are values that Christians , non @-@ Christians , people of other religions and of no religion share .
many opponents of this Constitution conjure up fears of a superstate ; many are opposed to the very existence of the European Union .
that is illustrated by those who oppose the supremacy of Union law over the law of Member States , which is after all the current situation .
what is the point of agreeing common laws across Europe if one does not want those laws to be applied across Europe ?
that is the whole point of agreeing common European legislation in the areas we want it , such as the environment and the common market .
there is no point in having that legislation if you are against it in the first place .
to those people I would say : be honest and campaign for what you really believe in , which is your country leaving the European Union , and do not hide behind attacking the Constitution .
what nonsense to say that this new Constitution will create a centralised superstate !
centralised , the European Union ?
when it is based on a Constitution that confers powers on the European Union with the agreement of every single Member State on the ratification of treaties ?
that is the only power the Union has .
even in exercising its powers , the Council - i.e. the Member States - has a central role in taking decisions , while the central administration - the European Commission - has fewer employees than the City of Leeds , in my constituency .
some superstate !
let me conclude by saying that this debate is partly one of myth against reality .
I am sure that by broadcasting the facts and enabling a true analysis of the Treaty we will contribute to an honest debate which will persuade people that this Constitution is worth having .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should firstly very much like to thank Parliament for this constructive and largely positive debate .
I am able broadly to concur with what has just been said by one of the rapporteurs concerning both the quality of this debate and the conclusions that must be drawn from it .
moreover , it was this Parliament that instigated this constitutional process .
as someone pointed out this morning , it was in this House that the constitutional process began , and I should like to pay tribute , on behalf of the Presidency , to Altiero Spinelli who , with his draft European Constitution of 1984 , initiated this process and set it going by introducing a first stage , known as the Single Act , negotiated moreover under the Luxembourg Presidency .
I should also like to say to those who have attacked and criticised this draft Constitution that , in a democratic debate , we obviously respect their position .
it is not , however , with nineteenth century discourses that a vision is offered to the peoples , European and others , of today &apos;s twenty @-@ first century world .
to turn in upon ourselves and return to outmoded concepts of sovereignty are inadequate responses in a globalised world .
they offer no solution at all in terms of prosperity , democracy and peace , neither to Europeans nor to others .
I should also like to say to those who draw a subtle distinction between a pro @-@ European &apos; no &quot; and an anti @-@ European &apos; no &quot; that there is only a &apos; no &quot; pure and simple , since a rejection of the Constitution is simply a defeat for Europe - a defeat for a stronger , more open , more transparent and more democratic Europe with perspectives to offer both within and beyond its own borders .
I therefore believe in the need not to become entangled in subtleties of this kind .
admittedly , not everything is perfect in this Constitution , as the rapporteur said .
we should all have liked to have seen improvements regarding this or that point .
is not , however , imperfection in a sense the very essence of democracy , since democracy thrives on compromise ; and must we not therefore be capable now of accepting a compromise that represents progress in order to make further progress in the future ?
as several speakers have said , the Constitution provides a sound basis for our shared values .
it supplies a democratic framework enabling the European Union to take more effective action where action is necessary , account having been taken of the principle of subsidiarity .
as has been said , the EU &apos;s motto , &apos; United in diversity &quot; characterises the essence of this Europe .
a balance between large and small Member States , equality between citizens and the respect for national identities mentioned by several speakers are the very essence of our EU , reflected very well in this constitutional document .
advances have been made . they are perhaps insufficient .
we should have liked to have gone further in the Justice and Home Affairs or external policy spheres , but I believe that the draft Constitution is an extremely important first stage .
nor should revisions be considered just at this time .
admittedly , every constitution needs to provide for revision mechanisms , as this one does ; in fact , it provides for various types of mechanism .
improvements will come as the years go by , on condition that this Constitution is adopted and that we are capable of applying it and using it to construct a genuine European democracy .
this document has been prepared with the broad participation not only of MEPs and of parliamentarians and other representatives from the Member States but also of representatives of civil society .
there has been a debate , albeit an inadequate one , in civil society .
this debate must be encouraged and supported , particularly through the ratification procedures that , as has been emphasised , have already been completed in two countries and that are to begin in other countries too .
in this respect , Article 1.47 , relating to participatory democracy , is an innovation , so much so that it is scarcely referred to in our national Constitutions .
it needs to be brought alive and given practical content .
the debate on the adoption of the Constitution has therefore begun , and it must be extended .
citizens must be fully involved in it , whether or not there are referendums .
I entirely agree with what the Vice @-@ President of the Commission said on the subject of communication , explanation and the efforts that must be made in order to make Europe better understood .
the Presidency concurs with this assertion .
I emphasise that this work must firstly be done in the Member States , for it is there that the people are building Europe .
it requires everyone &apos;s involvement : firstly , that of governments and parliamentarians but also , I repeat , that of the representatives of civil society .
in the course of the next few months , the Presidency will contribute everywhere it can , and everywhere it must , to this process and will encourage this debate .
.
Mr President , I would like to thank you all for this long but stimulating debate .
the vast majority of the comments have rightly paid tribute to this excellent report and to the work of the co @-@ rapporteurs .
hopefully , it will receive the overwhelming support of this House tomorrow .
I am conscious that this report and the Constitution need to be put into historical perspective .
this is the first time that the European Parliament has not had a list of regrets about the result of an Intergovernmental Conference , and we can ask one of the veterans in this kind of work about this .
if I compare this report to the Planas , Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos reports , for example , it is the most positive assessment of the outcome of an Intergovernmental Conference .
I share the views of those calling for a wide and honest debate .
without debate we do not have a democracy and , without debate , we do not get closer to the truth .
it is therefore our responsibility to provide examples of how the Constitution will affect the daily lives of European citizens .
the word &apos; perfect &apos; has been mentioned .
I have been a Commissioner for only five years and I have not yet seen the &apos; perfect &apos; document .
if you look around , how could we find a perfect document ?
we will have to continue to compromise because we are 25 Member States with different traditions , languages , political decision @-@ making procedures and views .
we will have to show the will and the capability to compromise .
this a compromise and it will have to be a compromise .
the words used this morning are worth recalling .
most of them are politically loaded - positively or negatively .
many have mentioned rights , democracy , openness , effectiveness and values .
Mr Méndez de Vigo reminded us this morning that the Constitution is the unique opportunity to guarantee the values of the Union .
we are united in our diversity but with a set of fundamental and social rights that brings us together .
these are the values we guarantee not just for us but for our children .
others have attempted to describe the Constitution as resulting in a European superstate , a loss of national sovereignty , or a weakening of the role of the national parliaments .
they have already received a reply from Mr Corbett .
while I expect that we should have to provide concrete facts and examples of the benefits of the Constitution as compared to the Treaty of Nice , I also expect that those talking about national sovereignty or national parliaments should provide some facts .
has the role of national parliaments been weakened ?
is it possible to sneak through a European law without supervision by the Member States or national parliaments ?
we have to be able to respond to those questions .
let us work on the basis of facts and the text of the Constitution .
this should be made accessible to our citizens in all the Member States , not just scare stories or misconceptions .
we also have to ensure that we are ready for the entry into force of the Constitution when it is ratified by all Member States .
we will shoulder our responsibilities and so must the Member States .
it is not enough to hope that adoption in one Member State will lead to automatic acceptance in the next country .
that is why in the Council I have pushed so strongly for proper national strategies to be developed .
as Mr Brok has indicated , preparatory work has already begun on the entry into force of the Constitution and the European external action service that will assist the European Minister for Foreign Affairs .
we are not exactly jumping ahead , but we have to start to be prepared .
we cannot simply wait and let another two years go by before we can implement the provisions .
we will have to prepared in the best possible way and find the right balance .
I agree that we must ensure respect for the text of the Constitution .
the speeches this morning from Members in the new Member States have illustrated the historic value of the European project and the principles and values that it guarantees .
whether we need a bigger boat , a larger bus or a larger dress size , we all recognise that we have a sense of responsibility .
I look forward to joining you in that debate .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
the next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on admission for employment .
Mr President , Mr Schmit , ladies and gentlemen , I have the honour of informing Parliament that the Green Paper on economic migration that I presented following agreement with my colleague , Commissioner Spidla , was adopted today by the College .
with this Green Paper , the Commission wishes to make a contribution to the current debate , a debate begun with the Tampere mandate concerning the most appropriate approach to the admission of economic migrants and concerning the added value represented by the adoption of such a common framework .
within the framework of the programme devised in The Hague , the European Council invited the Commission to present , before the end of 2005 , a proposal for a common European approach to legal immigration for economic reasons .
three years ago , the Commission had addressed a proposal to the Council on this subject , but this was not followed up because of the reluctance of several Member States to tackle the problem in a Community perspective .
the changes on the international stage , Europe &apos;s need for balanced management of the migration phenomenon and of the latter &apos;s many political , social and security implications and , finally , the signing of the Constitutional Treaty - which makes a clear distinction between subjects that fall within national competences and those which have , either in addition or exclusively , a Community dimension - are factors that have led the Council to engage in timely reflections and that have put this problem back on the agenda .
the strategy devised in The Hague defines objectives and establishes a timetable that the Commission intends to respect .
it is self @-@ evident that preparing a proposal in this area demands a wide , comprehensive and transparent debate and , above all , the participation of institutional and social actors in carrying out the research for evaluations , proposals and contributions .
indeed , police forces and the authorities responsible for conducting inquiries cannot have available to them all of the facts necessary for putting together both a picture of local situations and of migratory flows from different regions of the world to each European country and a picture of the conditions of integration that have already been met , or are to be promoted , for communities of citizens from outside the EU that already reside , or that are establishing themselves , in the EU .
indeed , these factors give rise to the sense of insecurity experienced by our fellow citizens and , in combating them , we must not confine ourselves to reactions in strictly military or policing terms .
on the contrary , political actions also have to be undertaken , beginning with a programme of initiatives designed to manage the flow of growing economic emigration towards , inevitably , our own countries that sometimes constitutes an undeniable advantage for the European economy .
finally , the public debate launched by the Commission in the form of its Green Paper will enable the Commission to collect a host of data and information that it will be able to use as a basis for preparing the proposals that are requested from it by the Council and that we shall present within the periods laid down .
Mr President , listening to Mr Frattini , I was thinking of the motto of the famous Belgian poet , Henri Michaux , about never despairing but allowing a solution to bubble up unbidden .
I do believe that we must pay tribute to the Commission for not having despaired but for having reopened a necessary and useful debate .
President Schmit , you should stay , for this is very much your area .
we are , indeed , very keen to see the Commission &apos;s move bear fruit .
you failed on a previous attempt in this area , in spite of the Commission &apos;s initiative and in spite of Parliament &apos;s commitment .
it was the Council that was unable to bring about an agreement .
the question I put to you , Mr Frattini - yes , it is to you that I am speaking - is this : what objective information do you have that leads you to think - and the question is , in truth , also addressed to Mr Schmit - that the blocks placed by the Council on the previous initiative are likely to be removed today , a prospect about which we are , on the face of it , delighted , albeit - it has to be said - slightly sceptical .
Commissioner , I am , of course , like my fellow MEP Mr Bourlanges , delighted that the Commission and the European Parliament are continuing with their common efforts to open legal immigration channels .
I should like , however , to put three questions to you , Commissioner .
the first is similar to Mr Bourlanges &quot; question : what practical legislative measures are you considering taking , and what will you do to stop the Council blocking such measures , as in the case of your first attempt in 2001 ?
the second question concerns your proposed sectoral legislation for legal immigration .
does not this approach endanger migrants &quot; rights by creating different regimes for each group ?
thirdly and finally , what measures will you adopt in order to link this immigration policy to a policy of European integration ?
Mr President , my questions follow on directly from Mrs Roure &apos;s comments .
firstly , we welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the initiative on this matter , and I hope that , this time , the Council not again stand in its way .
I believe that the European dimension of this task is more important than the individual interests of the Member States ; this is why it is essential for us to adopt European rules , as without such rules for this field we will be unable to create an internal market .
one could , however , be forgiven for wondering at this point what the precise nature of these European rules will be .
Mr Frattini , I have noticed that in your statements so far you have failed to say that the key regulations which are already in force , such as the ILO Convention , will be taken as a basis .
what part will be played in the Green Paper by the key issues referred to in the ILO Convention on migrant workers ?
in this connection , I should like to note that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission to incorporate these rules .
Mr Frattini , we have decided to divide the questions into three , by group .
do you wish , therefore , to respond now to the statements made by the three speakers ?
. Mr President , I can answer the three questions , which concern the same basic issue .
I would like to thank Mr Bourlanges and the Members who took the floor .
the first reason why I am reasonably optimistic over the possibility of attaining a tangible result , namely the adoption of a European initiative , is that , with regard to 2001 , it was the European Council - the very institution which in 2001 did not allow a similar measure to be adopted - which in November 2004 called on the Commission to adopt a European initiative by the end of 2005 .
within the framework of the Hague Programme , the Heads of State or Government , that is , those at the highest political level , asked the Commission to go ahead and to do so quickly .
that , in my view , demonstrates a new awareness of the fact that only Europe can provide the added value for a strategy on legal immigration .
the second reason is that with respect to the past , we have chosen what I would call a bottom @-@ up rather than a top @-@ down approach .
we have chosen to launch a debate with Parliament , with the European Economic and Social Committee , with employers &quot; associations and trade unions , so that we shall be ready to put forward a proposal only once we have gathered suggestions .
I am confident that this method will first of all enhance the transparency of the debate , secondly it will allow members of civil society to participate more actively in this debate than in the past , and thirdly it will enable Member States to approve or reject the proposal that the Commission will table , having the views of their employers &quot; associations , their trade unions and the European Parliament on hand .
these elements will consolidate the work .
I therefore cannot predict what tangible measures will be included in the Commission &apos;s initiative , precisely because today we are relaunching a European debate with the aim of gathering information and proposals which we shall submit to a public hearing in about the middle of this year , so that we can table a proposal by the end of 2005 .
at that time we will be in a better position to understand what the tangible measures will be .
I can only tell you that we intend to adopt a framework of minimum rules , to enable those who wish to work legally to do so , and at the same time to give people a preview of the provisions with the minimum of bureaucracy - there are currently 25 different rules on the admission of migrant workers , one per country .
we intend to establish a European framework with which anyone outside Europe can familiarise themselves beforehand : that will also help , in our opinion , to prevent illegal immigration .
Mr President , Commissioner , we feel that it is certainly commendable that immigrants are at last no longer considered a problem , but a resource - as the Green Paper expressly states - and that we are aiming for a permanent multicultural and multireligious dialogue .
we are concerned , however , by the productivity approach , as , moreover , you yourself called it in an interview for an Italian newspaper : that is , the decision to make migratory flows conditional on the requirements of the European labour market .
the Green Paper inclines towards the possibility - just a possibility , but one which we intend to comment on - of making the admission of an immigrant conditional on a job vacancy which it has not otherwise been possible to fill with European Union workers , or on a Member State &apos;s specific needs in particular employment sectors .
Commissioner , do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European immigration policy , as well as a step backwards from what many Member States have already achieved ?
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for the Green Paper .
since action was urgently required , and still is , I am delighted with it .
I have only just received the Green Paper , and so I have not had the chance to read the whole document , only the first few pages .
I was immediately struck by something on page 5 , where as regards the form of future European legislation with a view to the planned harmonisation , three proposals have been made .
at least , the impression is created that three options are still open , namely the horizontal approach , the sectoral approach and the so @-@ called common fast track procedure .
is it not , though , the case that , thanks to years of indecision on the part of the Council , we have tacitly already decided in favour of the sectoral approach ?
I think that the Peillon report about admitting third @-@ country scientists and researchers is a case in point .
that is backed by the Council , and that may explain your optimism to some extent .
Mr President , Commissioner , many Members have not had sight of the Green Paper yet , but at this early stage we should set down for you some basic principles of what is a very welcome discussion .
first , as my colleague Mrs Roure said , integration policy must be a vital component of any proposed legislation .
we know that we want to share best practice , but we still have a very vague position on integration policy .
secondly , managed migration means all things to all Members in this House .
for some it may mean control , for some it may mean the right to family unity .
this is a big gap and we must define in this discussion what managed migration actually means .
these are human beings coming from third countries to work in the European Union , they are not commodities .
we will have a set of principles and laws which will have to accommodate that .
finally , I very much welcome that civil society will have a much greater say , but we must then listen to civil society , to the trade unions and to business .
they have some good ideas , and we must not just pay lip service to those ideas but create a managed migration policy which will benefit both the European Union and those people and their families who are coming to benefit our economies .
. Mr President , the three interventions allow me to formulate one single comment .
firstly - and I am referring in particular to Mr Fava , who already knows this full well - a recognised , common , widespread principle , commonly referred to as the principle of preference for Community workers over third @-@ country workers , is not asserted for the first time , but merely repeated in the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union .
precisely to avoid the indiscriminate and unbalanced application of this principle , we believe that we need to explore , with the help of civil society , trade unions and businesses , what job opportunities exist for which there is no direct issue of taking work away from the citizens of our countries .
because , if this were the issue , clearly the impact of immigration on society would not be positive , whereas we must ensure that legal immigration leads to true integration .
this means workers being accepted into civil society and integrated into education , with real inclusion in society .
obviously , this matter is not addressed by the Green Paper , but is the subject of integration policies which will be the focus of a Commission action in 2005 .
these are areas that the Commission will be developing this year , in close cooperation with Parliament and the Presidency .
integration is an absolutely vital part of the process .
in this forum we seek instead to listen to suggestions as to how we can make European policy on the reception of third @-@ country workers uniform : that is our aim .
I would reiterate once more to those who asked again that today I cannot give any options or preferences among possible abstract solutions .
somebody asked me whether we could introduce an American @-@ style green card .
the answers will come from the public debate which will be starting , from Parliament and from the social actors to whom we shall listen .
with regard to one point I will , of course , confirm a commitment which you can already guess : the Commission will not confine itself to listening to advice , but will take into account the assessments and proposals that it gathers .
in conclusion , therefore , the Commission has two lines of action : turning what has until now been a national approach into a European approach , with the aim of promoting a more balanced policy , and above all , delimiting the phenomenon of legal immigration through a positive approach within our societies .
this approach is essential for true integration , which it will be difficult to achieve without it .
Mr President , I thank the Commission for its initiative , which is extremely welcome .
let me try to put a new twist on things .
there are tens of millions of Europeans living outside Europe who have benefited from the immigration policy of other countries - not only the United States , but also Australia , South Africa , New Zealand and many others .
these people - or a very interesting sample of them - met for the first time during the Greek presidency in June 2003 in Thessaloniki .
some of the most remarkably successful Italians , Greeks , Czechs , Romanians and others living around the world came to tell us about their experiences .
their experience , as European citizens , of being integrated into those countries could be extremely helpful to you , Commissioner .
I was involved in this and I would be happy to help your staff plan a meeting with these people .
I do not believe that any of us here feel that the relatives we have in third countries have harmed those countries , nor do the host countries feel that they have harmed them .
so for us as Europeans to fear the notion of legal migration so greatly goes against our personal experiences .
let us hear the experiences of these people .
their experiences might even enable us to make it easier for our own citizens - identifying as they will with them - to understand the benefits of legal migration to Europe .
I have an observation to make , or rather a question to ask of Commissioner Frattini .
I am not familiar with the Green Paper , but I would like this document to contain provisions to ensure that in future Europe will not be suspected or accused , as has sometimes been the case with the United States , of causing a &apos; brain drain &quot; from poor countries .
we need to make sure that people who come to European universities or scientific institutes to study or train do not remain here for whatever reasons , whether working or not , as this represents a loss for their own countries .
the countries affected are frequently poor countries , whose development depends to a large extent on the education of such an elite .
a policy must be developed which ensures that on the one hand it is possible to work here for a certain length of time , but that on the other hand instruments also exist which would not so much force people to return as encourage them to do so , in order to put the knowledge and experience they have gained to use in developing their own cultures and societies .
Mr President , I have a sense of here , having drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on a number of these issues .
I have a number of questions .
what attention is going to be paid to the work that Parliament has already done on these issues ?
we have put forward a considerable number of proposals , which we discussed with civil society , trade unions and business .
the trade unions will demand parity of treatment for third country nationals coming to work in the European Union , so that they are not paid poorly to undercut workers here .
business people will tell you that they want entry made easier so that they are not acting as a parallel immigration system .
one of the things that have changed since Parliament last looked at this is that we now have ten new Member States .
if we are looking at a hierarchy of movement for employment , presumably the Commission is looking at removing the transition periods for those new Member States as part of that change in the hierarchical system of entry for employment .
Mr President , I am particularly keen to pick up on Mrs Lambert &apos;s comments on transition periods .
we should do our best to avoid perpetuating the absurd situation whereby third @-@ country nationals are invited to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place .
a balance of some kind must be found , and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter .
I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue , above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens , as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected .
on a slightly different note , I have noticed that the Green Paper is littered with a great many questions .
given that the issue of labour migration is such a complex one , it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side , in line with the principle of &apos; keep it simple , stupid . &quot;
. I thank all Members of Parliament for their suggestions and opinions .
the fundamental purpose of this proposal is that legal migration should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity for all of us and for Europe in particular .
in this period we will launch a public debate .
we will take into account the work already done by Parliament , particularly on equality of rights and opportunities for legal migrants .
we will take into account suggestions , concrete proposals , and we will consider all proposals as a very positive contribution in the spirit of open and frank cooperation .
I should like to mention the important issue of &apos; brain drain &apos; .
this issue of brain drain and what to do about it will be one of the key subjects in the particular and specific communication on migration and development , which the Commission will present in Spring 2005 .
I can already assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the acuteness of this problem , particularly in specific countries and sectors such as healthcare .
the Commission intends to propose a tailor @-@ made approach where responses could be made that are commensurate with the magnitude of this very important and sensitive problem .
in this way , we will put emphasis on the positive impact that migration can have on countries of origin .
finally , I can assure you that this problem will be taken fully into account by the Commission .
that concludes the item on the Commission communication on the Green Paper on admission for employment .
I should like to thank Commissioner Frattini and the speakers .
Mr Ortuondo Larrea has asked to be given the floor in order to make a personal statement .
Mr President , if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty , I would say , firstly , that it is integrationist ; secondly , that it is based on free accession ; thirdly , that it is respectful of different identities , cultures , languages and institutional structures and creates a European citizenship which does not exclude , but rather co @-@ exists with , other citizens from the Member countries .
in the Basque country , our Parliament has just approved , by an absolute majority , a new Statute for co @-@ existence with the Spanish State which , in fact , is inspired by the Community model , which maintains these same principles I have indicated and is respectful of the Constitutional Treaty .
nevertheless , in this morning &apos;s debate one Member has accused it of attacking the European Constitution and has said that the Basque President and the Basque Nationalist Party have allied themselves with the enemies of Europe .
that is entirely false .
we are going to support a &apos; yes &quot; vote and we advocate a &apos; yes &quot; to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum .
and we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the Spanish State , on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages , free accession and common work within a united Europe .
we Basques have supported European integration from the outset , and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty .
the next item is Question Time , with questions to the Commission ( B6 @-@ 0001 / 2005 ) .
as a result of the proposal adopted by the Commission on 26 October , textile import quotas are going to be abolished from 1 January 2005 .
in terms of industrial restructuring and employment , this decision is going to have very major consequences for some of the Union &apos;s regions .
economists in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region are already speaking about the loss of 9 000 of the 29 000 direct jobs in the textile industry in that area .
a veritable human tragedy awaits the workers concerned and their families .
what specific aid measures is the Commission going to take to safeguard and develop employment in the EU &apos;s major textile industry regions , particularly in terms of structural funding and combating intra- and extra @-@ European relocation processes ?
honourable Members , I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Mandelson , who is unable to be here today as he is currently on his way to India .
the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing , which established a ten @-@ year period for the elimination of the quotas , expired on 31 December 2004 , and trade in textile and clothing products is henceforth subject to the general WTO rules .
quota removal is likely to reshape the export of textile and clothing and global outsourcing trends .
there may be a substitution effect among suppliers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products , economies of scale , competitive prices and efficient services .
the impact of abolishing quotas will indeed be considerable , though it is difficult to assess at this stage .
moreover , it is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions , the ability to achieve competitive advantages in the higher value added production segment and domestic policy responses .
sustained efforts are needed to help upgrade the skill levels of workers , improve the quality of their jobs and empower social partners at all levels to address the many challenges in the sector .
as far as Europe is concerned , this sector definitely has assets for the future .
investment , a move upmarket and world leadership in the fashion industry have made Europe the world &apos;s biggest exporter of textiles and its second biggest exporter of clothing .
the Commission believes that this entails a three @-@ pronged response : monitor the level of imports into the EU , help the sector strengthen its competitiveness and remain a key industry in the EU , and keep a special focus on the poorest and more vulnerable developing countries .
the Commission communication of 13 October 2004 , entitled &apos; Textiles and Clothing after 2005 &apos; , is a key element of this strategy .
this communication was a response to the set of recommendations by the High Level Group on Textiles and Clothing , in which trade unions were represented .
on structural funding and relocation processes , the participation of the textile and clothing sector in multisectoral programmes should provide an efficient framework for supporting the sector , allow for diversification of production and ultimately serve the economic interests of the regions in question .
in addition , the Commission proposes that in all future programmes , Member States should reserve an amount of 1 % of the Structural Fund &apos;s annual contribution for the &apos; Convergence &apos; objective and 3 % of the Structural Fund &apos;s annual contribution for the &apos; Regional competitiveness and employment &apos; objective , to cover unforeseen local or sectoral crises linked to economic and social restructuring or to the consequences of trade opening .
Madam President , allow me to express to this House my heartfelt solidarity with the millions of employees who will see their lives shattered in the interests of satisfying , once again , a minority of affluent people .
indeed , the economists of the International Federation of Trade Unions talk of what they , if not the Commission , know will be the destruction of thirty million jobs , a million of them in Europe , North Africa , Sri Lanka and Indonesia .
as if what a number of these countries have just experienced were not enough , they now find themselves in even deeper trouble .
it is , I strongly emphasise , the Commission &apos;s , the Council &apos;s and Parliament &apos;s responsibility and duty to put a stop to this social disaster .
the Commission must be aware of the problem of forced and illegal child labour in the cocoa industry .
West Africa provides most of the world &apos;s cocoa , where over 200 000 children are thought to be working in hazardous conditions on cocoa farms ( International Institute of Tropical Agriculture , July 2002 ) .
European consumers are faced with the possibility that some of the chocolate they eat has been produced by forced labour .
could the Commission inform me of what initiatives it has undertaken to ensure that the taste of slavery is irradicated from the European diet ?
.
honourable Members , I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Michel , who is unable to be here this afternoon , as he must attend the donors &apos; conference on the tsunami disaster .
on this issue , the approach of the Commission is twofold .
firstly , on the one hand , we support the initiatives and programmes of the ILO .
secondly , we reinforce the capacity of the countries in the region to implement the relevant Cotonou provisions and different Economic Community of West African States protocols and initiatives in the area of child protection .
the International Labour Organisation , through its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour , launched in 2000 a new initiative called &apos; Combating Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation in West and Central Africa &apos; .
in 2003 a &apos; West Africa Cocoa / Commercial Agricultural Programme to Combat Hazardous and Exploitative Child Labour &apos; was added , focusing in particular on cocoa farming .
the Commission has a strategic partnership with the ILO , in which the fight against child labour is a priority .
in that context , a programme of EUR 15 million under the ACP funds is currently under consideration .
the objectives would be , , firstly , to establish a sustainable mechanism to prevent children from carrying out all sorts of labour in the agricultural and other sectors .
secondly , to strengthen the capacity of national and community @-@ level agencies and organisations in planning , initiating , implementing and evaluating action to prevent and progressively eliminate child labour .
thirdly , to remove all children involved in work in the cocoa sector , to prevent children at risk from entering such work , and to improve the income @-@ earning capacity of adult family members , particularly women , through social protection schemes .
ECOWAS is active as a regional organisation in the fight against child labour .
in addition to the Cotonou provisions on trade and labour standards , the ECOWAS Heads of State have adopted a declaration and a plan of action to fight child exploitation , and ECOWAS has recently set up a child unit in its secretariat .
the 9th EDF Regional Indicative Programme will provide capacity @-@ building to this new unit within ECOWAS , with a view to promoting the effectiveness of its work .
I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the ILO and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public domain .
I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making profits out of this at the moment , by perhaps insisting that unless European companies - and do not forget that Europeans and North Americans consume most of these cocoa products - can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and profits on the back of child labour , then they cannot import them into Europe .
has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it ?
. the Commission believes that the framework of the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the 77 ACP countries gives real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice , as well as the corruption element that may be linked to it , through political dialogue and support for good governance in ACP countries .
moreover , it considers that poverty and the lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for exploitative child labour and child trafficking .
the poverty- reduction approach through EU development cooperation is a sound basis for tackling the problem as it gives priority to equitable growth and to better access to education .
finally , the Cotonou Agreement represents an important step forward in promoting CLS in bilateral agreements .
Article 50 includes a specific provision on trade and labour standards , which reaffirms the commitments of the Parties to international CLS as defined by the relevant ILO Conventions .
is the Commission aware of the fact that the world Chocolate Manufacturers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue ?
would the Commission therefore undertake to look at the report that is due in the middle of this year from the international chocolate manufacturers , commend them on the work that they have been doing and encourage them to continue to develop their certification programme ?
I am at a loss as to why chocolate has been singled out in this respect because there are many other food products being sourced from Third World countries where the same issues pertain - labelling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector .
.
I will certainly bring Mr Harbour &apos;s comments to Mr Michel &apos;s attention .
I propose that the Commission immediately commence talks with the Russian Federation on the threat of a suspension of and raising barriers against food exports to Russia from Poland and other new Member States .
these talks should help facilitate , normalise , accelerate and define the inspection criteria .
I wish to express my indignation at the Commission &apos;s stated position that the issue of veterinary inspections by the Russian Federation is an internal matter for the above states .
this statement smacks of discrimination against the new Member States in EU internal relations , because Member States do not have the power to make independent decisions regarding veterinary matters related to the import of products from third countries .
hence , it will be impossible to resolve the problem without dialogue between all the parties .
this situation is not new to the Commission , as it has already &apos; supported &apos; talks between France and the United States on a similar matter .
. I am responding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Kyprianou , who is unable to be here today , as he is unwell .
the Commission has made all reasonable efforts to avoid disruption in exports of animal and plant products from the European Union to Russia .
this potential disruption arises from Russian insistence that EU exports meet its specific import requirements .
for animal products , there was the concrete concern that trade would be totally blocked from 1 January 2005 .
from this date , in fact , Russia insists on a single set of sanitary certificates for imports .
however , negotiations led by the Commission on behalf of the EU have averted this risk .
as regards plant products , where a similar risk to exports could materialise from 1 April 2005 , the Commission intended to start negotiations as soon as the risk emerged , and asked the Council to endorse this .
following a debate among Member States on the basis of this request , the AGRI Council in December 2004 agreed and the Commission immediately started negotiations on these issues on behalf of the EU .
the Commission is confident that this will lead to a successful outcome .
the honourable Member can be assured , therefore , that although the Commission has very little competence in relation to export requirements in third countries , it has expressed its willingness and has been proactive in view of helping to solve this kind of problem and , as soon as the Commission was given the green light from the Council , it engaged in timely negotiations .
in the course of negotiations , no distinction has been made between the new and former Member States .
however , Russia has insisted on inspecting all establishments in the new Member States which have requested approval for export .
the Commission has highlighted that these same establishments have been approved for intra @-@ EU trade following the enlargement process .
it has also pressed for the inspection process to be carried out as quickly as possible .
overall , this situation has undoubtedly led to disruption in the trade of these Member States with Russia , and it is not made easier by the fact that Russia is not a member of the WTO and does not therefore consider itself bound by the rules of the WTO .
the honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission has involved all Member States in the efforts to avoid trade disruption , in particular the new Member States .
these efforts are continuing and the Commission will continue to defend the Community interest .
Madam President , Commissioner , the situation is more dramatic than might be supposed from the Commissioner &apos;s reply .
since 1 May , Russia has been playing games and not accepting goods from Poland in retaliation for the refusal by certain countries , such as the Baltic countries , to accept Russian imports because they failed to meet the sanitary requirements laid down by the EU .
Member States do not , however , have the power to take independent decisions on veterinary matters relating to imports of products from third countries .
I would ask you to take urgent action on this matter .
.
as I stated in my reply , the Commission has treated this matter with considerable urgency , when we asked the Council to give us the go @-@ ahead and when we engaged in negotiations .
the honourable Member is correct that it imposes certain major difficulties on some of these countries and the Commission will do its very best to achieve a satisfactory solution .
however , I must stress the limits of what we can achieve .
hopefully , with goodwill on all sides , the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future .
there is widespread concern that the draft Services Directive , particularly its &apos; country of origin &apos; provision , may lead to social dumping and a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; in service provision .
will the Commission now withdraw the draft directive and initiate a process of consultation aimed at producing a more balanced proposal , while also taking into account the need for a Framework Directive to enable delivery of high @-@ quality services of general interest / public services ?
.
the Commission wishes to stress that removing internal market barriers is not tantamount to undermining the quality of services , or that the Services Directive will lead to social dumping - quite the contrary .
as regards the protection of workers , the proposed directive does not affect the existing Community , namely the Posted Workers &quot; Directive from 1996 .
this directive provides that posted workers , including temporary workers , enjoy , irrespective of the law applicable to the employment relationship , a number of important protective provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the worker is posted .
therefore , companies cannot use this proposal in order to establish themselves in low @-@ wage countries to circumvent the social protection of the host Member State .
in addition , the proposed directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between Member States and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host Member State in the supervision of working conditions .
the proposed directive will thus help to prevent social dumping .
the Commission does not share the concern that the directive will lead to a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; in service provision .
first , the country of origin principle only applies to the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
for services provided via an establishment in another Member State - for example a hospital or a home for the elderly - the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State .
second , the country of origin principle is embedded in harmonisation and enhanced administrative cooperation between Member States .
moreover , a number of derogations from the country of origin principle cover , for instance , the applicable working conditions in the context of posting of workers , consumer contracts , health and safety on building sites and public health .
finally , the Commission wishes to stress that the proposed directive does not require the liberalisation or privatisation of services which are currently provided at national , regional or local level by the public sector or public entities .
neither does the proposal affect the freedom of the Member States to define what they consider to be services of general economic interest and how they should be organised or financed .
furthermore , it does not affect Member States &apos; ability to maintain appropriate regulations concerning the quality , availability and performance of services of general interest , or other regulations ensuring consumer and user rights .
it is also important to note that the proposal does not prejudge the work on , or the outcome of , specific Community initiatives , in particular the follow @-@ up to the White Paper on services of general interest .
the Commission has committed to a genuine dialogue with both co @-@ legislators and interested parties with a view to finding solutions to specific areas of concern .
to date , the need for a major step forward in opening the internal market has not yet been validly contested .
I am confident that also the honourable Member would like to see companies , consumers and workers enjoy the benefits of an open and competitive integrated services market .
we are all aware of the economic and social challenges facing the European Union .
bearing in mind the importance of the services sector , the proposed directive will contribute significantly to addressing these challenges .
firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in Parliament .
I look forward to more .
I am a little bewildered by the Commissioner &apos;s reply .
his reply indicates that this directive will do nothing , that it is not going to affect any of the areas about which we have expressed concern .
he says it will only apply to temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
in what way , then , will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market ?
if it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross @-@ border provisions , how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market ?
.
as I pointed out in my reply , the country of origin principle applies only to the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
the rest of the directive deals with any other areas .
if services are provided via an establishment in another Member State , the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State .
I should like to point out to the honourable Member that I would accept that the Services Directive is very ambitious : it aims to provide an overarching framework .
I am aware of the concerns of many Members of this Parliament and people outside this Parliament .
I am very conscious that it has raised the political temperature in a number of Member States .
I have entered into an open and constructive dialogue with Members , and I will continue to do that .
I look forward to future communications from your rapporteur to assess parliamentarians &apos; views within the committee responsible .
would the Commissioner agree that it is vitally important for Members of this House to understand the huge variety of discriminatory and anti @-@ competitive practices that Member States currently apply against service providers ?
it would be very helpful if you could explain these in more detail to Members of this Parliament who persist in describing this directive in the entirely unjustified terms you have so convincingly dismissed in your answer of &apos; social dumping &apos; and a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; .
there is no evidence whatsoever that either of those things will happen , and it would be helpful if the job creation facet inherent in this directive were properly communicated .
.
I certainly agree with the honourable Member that the opportunities for job creation from an opening @-@ up of the services market throughout Europe are immense .
various studies have been initiated , and there are great opportunities for job creation .
given that services account for well over 60 % of the Union &apos;s GDP , it is clear that any improvement in the services area is going to lead to an increase in wealth and jobs for people in the Union .
I agree with the honourable Member that many anti @-@ competitive practices exist in lots of Member States that prevent the real opening @-@ up of the services market .
the services directive is attempting to open up the services area to the benefit of everybody in Europe .
but having said that , and in reply to the earlier question from Mr De Rossa , I am also conscious of the specific concerns expressed by Members .
hopefully , during the parliamentary process and other processes we will be able to tease these concerns out further .
if you take the qualifications that the Commissioner expressed in his answer to the first question at face value , it is clear that this directive would not apply to the UK health service , which is based on care that is free at the point of use .
if we can take his reassurances at face value , why does he not simply exclude health from the scope of this directive ?
.
the approach that I have adopted with the European Parliament and others who have raised concerns is to have those concerns and problems put on the table and into a document .
I would not wish to start with a list of the items I think should be removed .
that would not be the correct approach .
I accept that this is a very ambitious document , what we are trying to achieve is worth fighting for .
people come to various issues in this House from various perspectives , with their own experiences and political and economic philosophies .
what we all have to accept is that if Europe is to meet the challenges of the future and keep the social protection model and other things that we aspire to and want in Europe , we have to ensure that the European economy grows .
standing still is not an option .
the Services Directive attempts to open up this particular market .
as I pointed out in reply to Mr Harbour , services make up the bulk of the European Union &apos;s economic activity , therefore it is a goal well worth fighting for .
in early 2004 , the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive on services as a crucial contribution to the pursuit of the Lisbon Strategy .
this proposal has provoked a great deal of debate , including strong support as well as fierce opposition from some quarters .
what conclusions does the Commission draw from the reactions that the proposal has generated ?
could the Commission indicate why it has chosen to table a proposal with such a broad scope and why it is putting so much emphasis on the role of the country of establishment of the service provider ?
why did the Commission not opt for a sector @-@ by @-@ sector approach ?
what is the role of the service sector in the EU &apos;s economy , and what part of this involves cross @-@ border activities ?
what tangible results relevant to the Lisbon Objectives does the Commission hope to achieve with this proposal ?
. as the honourable Member has pointed out , the proposed Directive on services in the internal market is at the heart of our efforts to reform the European economy .
services account for approximately 70 % of EU GDP and employment .
the removal of internal market barriers in the area of services , as foreseen by the proposal , is essential for meeting the growth and employment targets which lie at the heart of the Lisbon Agenda .
the potential economic opportunities arising from this proposal are indeed huge .
this has been underlined by recent Dutch economic research which shows that implementation of the proposal in its current form could result in an increase in bilateral trade and direct foreign investment in commercial services by 15 % to 35 % .
the Commission has proposed a horizontal directive for several different reasons .
first , a broad range of services is dealt with because many of the barriers identified are common to various service activities .
the most efficient way to address these barriers is in a horizontal way .
secondly , a large scale and detailed harmonisation process through sectoral directives would be unnecessary , unrealistic and inconsistent with better regulation and subsidiarity principles .
thirdly , the services proposal takes into account the specificity of certain activities , proposes specific harmonisation where this is deemed necessary and adopts a phased approach to implementation .
it is clear that the proposal has provoked a great deal of discussion .
however , this is exactly what a proposal this ambitious and far @-@ reaching can be expected to do .
it shows that the proposal is addressing some very important questions .
at the same time , this also means that there is a lot of work to be done to achieve a common goal .
the country of origin approach is a central element of the proposal , as far as the cross @-@ border supply of services is concerned .
it eliminates the problem of cross @-@ border services being subject to a multitude of different rules .
this will stimulate the offer of cross @-@ border services and improve the competitiveness of the EU economy .
the country of origin approach is in particular essential for SMEs , who do not have the means to establish a subsidiary or an office in another Member State and therefore can export their know @-@ how only by the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
I wish to note , however , that the country of origin approach does not apply for services provided through a fixed commercial presence in the host country .
at the same time , I wish to reiterate that the country of origin approach does not operate in isolation .
over and above the specific harmonisation foreseen for certain activities , the proposal also foresees the further development of administrative cooperation between Member State authorities and administrations .
this harmonisation and cooperation will generate the degree of confidence between Member States required for the effective application of the country of origin approach .
finally , a number of derogations are foreseen for services demonstrating a particular sensitivity because of the need to protect consumers , public health or public security , or where the current divergence of Member States &apos; legislation does not allow the application of the country of origin approach .
as pointed out in my earlier reply , the Commission is confident that the proposal is the best way to allow the economic potential of the services sector to materialise , in the interest of our workers , our consumers and our companies .
I also wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy to his first Question Time in Parliament and to re @-@ emphasise at the outset that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and objectives because they can create greater wealth and employment within the European Union .
however , turning to his reply , one of the biggest hindrances to cross @-@ border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one @-@ stop shop for registration of a company , that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State , it should be reciprocal in all other Member States , because the same basis for decision @-@ making under the internal market rules should apply .
. the country of origin approach which lies at the heart of the Services Directive will allow for the circumstances Mr Crowley has outlined .
as I said in my reply , it will allow companies to operate in another Member State without having to go through a multitude of further tests .
that is the basis of the country of origin principle as it would apply to the circumstances outlined .
I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in this House .
I should like to ask him , in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity - aspects of the Lisbon Agenda - if he would confirm that he shares my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed , especially when Europe is compared to the United States ?
in this regard , would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the workplace - which is greatly restricted in the EU compared to the situation in the US , in part because of the lack of affordable childcare facilities - needs to be addressed ?
will the Commission address this issue ?
. I welcome Mr Mitchell &apos;s contribution , but would like to point out that the matters referred to come under the remit of my colleague , Mr Spidla .
Mr Mitchell has gone into further problems relating to growth within the European Community .
the Lisbon process is about addressing these matters and , as you will be aware , Mr Barroso has made the Lisbon Agenda his top priority for our period in office .
I note what the honourable Member has said regarding access by women to the labour market and his comments about childcare .
I am sure other colleagues in the Commission will address these matters .
I too wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy .
when it comes to the Services Directive , it is clear that not everyone has understood why it is needed .
I therefore think it would be appropriate , and shall also ask the Commissioner if it might not be appropriate , to produce a list of examples clearly showing how companies have , in practical terms , been prevented from contributing to economic development .
one example is the case of a French company that wishes to produce gravestones being prevented from doing so by Germans and exposed to threats of fines .
can the Commissioner come back with a full and practical list of the host of problems we have seen in SOLVIT and in other contexts - problems to which companies are exposed and that prevent economic development ?
. we have produced such a document and I shall gladly send a copy of it to the honourable Member .
Madam President , I know how hard it is to chair these sessions , but I wonder what relevance that supplementary had to Mr Mitchell &apos;s original question ?
Mrs Cederschiöld seemed to have jumped back to the previous question .
I know my colleague Mr De Rossa had a genuine supplementary on the previous question and was refused the floor !
Mr Martin , it is evident that the whole House takes a great deal of interest in this matter .
a great many Members had asked to speak , and there is no way for me to know in advance what Members &quot; supplementary questions will relate to when I give them the floor .
perhaps you should discuss the matter again with Mrs Cederschiöld .
the second part of Question Time has already overrun in any case , which means that Questions Nos 31 to 33 can no longer be taken , and will instead be answered in writing .
we shall now proceed to the next set of questions .
the Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State or Government agreed in San José de Costa Rica last November to focus on encouraging education programmes , as the key to Latin American development .
does this also provide the Commission with a window of opportunity in the field of EU @-@ Latin American relations ?
. Madam President , I must admit that this is my first Question Time , but I am looking forward to it .
an opportunity to deal with specific issues should always be welcomed .
I shall now speak in English .
this was a question on education , which is indeed a very important sector in the framework of the Commission &apos;s relations with Latin America .
the importance of this sector has been stressed by the Heads of State and Government of both regions in Rio , in Madrid , in Guadalajara and at various different summits , calling in particular for the reinforcement of regional cooperation at the level of higher education .
the Commission is currently implementing cooperation programmes at national , subregional and regional levels in the field of education worth about EUR 300 million .
in particular the Commission is financing two regional programmes in the field of higher education .
one is the Alfa programme - , and the other is the Alban programme - .
the Alfa programme promotes cooperation between higher education institutions and other relevant organisations in the two regions with a view to human and institutional capacity @-@ building , mobilising the civil society of both the EU and Latin America regions as a whole and therefore creating and reinforcing lasting bonds .
Alfa 1 covers the period 1994 @-@ 1999 and Alfa 2 the period 2000 @-@ 2005 .
concerning allocations , Alfa 1 has a budget of EUR 32 million and Alfa 2 a budget of EUR 42 million .
the Alban programme was launched in 2002 at the EU @-@ Latin America Madrid summit , thereby responding to the recommendations of the Rio de Janeiro summit .
the programme awards scholarships to Latin American nationals for education training at master and doctorate levels in institutions in the EU , as well as for higher training for professionals from Latin America in organisations in the Union .
at regional and national level , several education projects are being implemented , notably in basic education .
it is worth noting that the EUR 74.6 million programme is dedicated to education in the context of the programme for reconstruction and rehabilitation in Central America following Hurricane Mitch in 1998 .
in Nicaragua the Commission is contributing to the improvement of the education sector through budget support totalling EUR 62.5 million .
Madam President , I would like first of all to welcome the Commissioner , Mrs Ferrero , who , as well as having an adopted Hispanic surname , has a mastery of Spanish and is knowledgeable about Latin America .
her reply has satisfied me .
she has told me what I wanted to know about the Commission &apos;s support for the education programmes and , in particular , for the instrument I referred to in my question , the Summit of Iberoamerican Heads of State or Government , which is made up of the Spanish- and Portuguese @-@ speaking countries of Latin America , as well as Spain and Portugal .
I thank you once again , Commissioner .
we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues further in the future .
. since the answer has already been given , I have nothing to add .
in its campaign entitled &apos; Would you leave it to chance ? - We don &apos;t &apos; the Commission is sending out the message that Europe has a substantial amount of money available for development cooperation .
the statement by Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner in this campaign says that the world must become a better place , but this evidently means primarily for Europeans and that development cooperation must in the first instance bring stability to our &apos; immediate neighbourhood &apos; .
combating poverty has been relegated to a secondary role .
can the Commission say whether this approach , which is primarily designed to make Europe more secure rather than providing permanent solutions to third world development , is compatible with the development agenda of the developing countries and consistent with Article 177 of the Treaty and the UN Millennium goals ?
.
as the Commission pointed out when it launched the poster campaign , the priorities of European Commission development cooperation are : to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty ; promote sustainable development ; build democracies ; contribute to the integration of developing countries into the world economy ; support good governance and promote respect for human rights .
the Commission is committed to helping developing countries achieve the development goals of the millennium .
however , there are important objectives and activities that go far beyond the millennium development goals .
for example , promoting peace and security and also supporting institution building .
a comprehensive , integrated approach is therefore essential in achieving sustainable development , as made clear also by the Treaty on European Union in Article 3 , which emphasises the importance of assuring consistency of external policies and instruments in the context of external relations , security , development , economic and trade policy .
this is also clearly stressed in the 2004 annual report on the Community &apos;s development policy .
the Community &apos;s external actions , including assistance , are further adapted to the diversity of our partner regions and countries .
the European neighbourhood policy is an expression of such a comprehensive and integrated partner strategy .
similarly , our relations with the larger developing countries in Asia and Latin America in particular cover a broad range of objectives .
in this context , it is clear that bringing concrete benefits to our partners will make the world a better place , not only for the people directly benefiting from EC assistance but also for European citizens .
however , this does not change the overriding objective of the development policy of the European Commission , that is to eradicate poverty .
Madam President , I am pleased with the Commissioner &apos;s response , because I have to say that I was a little shocked when I read her statement of 2 December .
indeed , one could have been forgiven for thinking that the objectives that she listed did not agree with the millennium objectives .
Commissioner , this issue has been discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control before .
in this respect too , you have encroached upon the area of development cooperation .
Mr Michel is the Commissioner for Development and I think that good agreements will need to be made , also in terms of statements made , to prevent what you said from being misinterpreted in the broader context of the millennium objectives .
I should like to ask you to consult with Mr Michel very carefully on this score .
.
thank you for acknowledging that this campaign is going to the right development goals .
it underlines the key sectors of the external assistance policy , as defined in the development policy communication and in the development goals .
there are seven elements to the seven priorities of the European Commission intervention .
one is prosperity , achieved by trade and the private sector .
second , security , which is being achieved via justice and regional cooperation .
third is freedom , achieved by human rights and good governance .
fourth is food : food security and rural development .
fifth , water : the water initiative protecting sustainable development .
Sixth , education : education systems and access to schools .
lastly , the EuropeAid message - &apos; partnerships improving lives worldwide &apos; - evokes the how and why of external assistance .
with regard to scope , the campaign is reaching out to over 150 countries worldwide .
it is establishing long @-@ term partnerships , and its approach is to focus on ownership of projects in partner countries .
priority areas results are also to be focused upon : there must be a demonstrable impact on people &apos;s lives .
this campaign has really gone to the heart of what we want to do and comes under the umbrella of the overall goals .
in the light of Israel &apos;s continued breach of the EU @-@ Israel Protocols , will the Commission consider the suspension of these agreements ?
the human rights clause in the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement places &apos; economic freedom and the principles of the United Nations Charter , particularly the observance of human rights and democracy &quot; as &apos; the very basis of the Association . &quot;
Article 2 , the Operative Clause , clearly states that &apos; relations between the Parties , as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself , shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles , which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement . &quot;
.
in response to your call for the suspension of the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement , it is the Commission &apos;s judgement that measures such as sanctions would make the Israeli authorities less , rather than more , responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting solution .
this is at a time when the EU is seeking to have a very constructive role in ensuring that the withdrawal from Gaza takes place in a positive climate , in cooperation with a new , and now democratically @-@ elected , Palestinian leadership .
I fully recognise the frustrations of those seeking to promote the peace process when confronted by Israel &apos;s expansion of its settlement activities .
the European Commission has regularly expressed its concerns not only at the continuing terrorism and violence but also at the route of the separation barrier and the expansion of settlements .
our wish is to address these issues through dialogue .
the Commission is seeking to develop relations with Israel and the Palestinians through the European Neighbourhood Policy , through support for Palestinian reforms and the development of political dialogue with Israel .
the action plan adopted for Israel includes measures to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on the importance of adherence to international law and the need to preserve the perspective of a viable , comprehensive settlement , which involves minimising the impact of security and counter @-@ terrorism measures on the civilian population .
it is the Commission &apos;s view - and I believe this is shared by the Member States - that measures to suspend the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement would therefore be counterproductive .
I fully accept what the Commissioner says about the changing circumstances .
since I tabled this question , Mr Abbas has been elected as leader of the Palestinians and we have seen Mr Peres join the Israeli Government .
that gives us some hope for dialogue between the two sides .
however , I would ask her , in her new role , to keep this Protocol under constant review and to keep the pressure on Israel to observe the contents of the Protocol .
I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East Jerusalem , the Golan Heights , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
I ask her to continue to monitor the situation to ensure that products from those areas are not labelled as &apos; products of Israel &apos; .
.
I can assure you that the Commission will certainly do that , because just before Christmas we had such a Council meeting .
this has of course been one of the important issues in the Council so we will try to do our best to get both parties to abide by their obligations .
on 9 December , at the time of the adoption of the initial action plans for the new European neighbourhood policy , the Commissioner responsible for external relations and European neighbourhood policy stated that his objective was to create a circle of friends around the enlarged Union &apos;s borders .
of the seven countries with which the first action plans were concluded , only Ukraine directly shares terrestrial borders with the enlarged Union .
on the other hand , Belarus , which shares borders with three new EU Member States is , according to the Commissioner , not democratic enough to be included in the programme .
does the Commission plan to implement other internal measures to resolve the Belarus problem ?
does it intend to take account of the proposals to set up a cross @-@ cutting Community assistance programme in the field of human rights and democracy or to broadcast radio or TV programmes from neighbouring countries ?
are there plans to set up an EU delegation in Minsk or to appoint an EU representative to Belarus ?
these initiatives would contribute to the building @-@ up of civil society in Belarus and to the process of democratisation , without in any way compromising with the country &apos;s authoritarian regime .
.
the Commission underlines that the European Neighbourhood Policyframework is very important , and it wants to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged European Union and its neighbours , including Belarus .
a key principle of the &apos; Ring of Friends &apos; is forging joint ownership .
the Union cannot impose its policy on anyone , but it is ready to convince its neighbours of the benefits of the ENP .
the Union is offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of its relations - from political dialogue to economic integration - on the basis of commitment to common values .
this offer is , in principle , also valid for Belarus .
through the ENP , the Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus .
if and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place , it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP , with all the benefits that would bring .
under current conditions , however , there can be no fully @-@ fledged ENP action plan for Belarus .
the October 2004 parliamentary elections and the referendum were important milestones for Belarus under the ENP , but , unfortunately , Belarus failed to achieve them .
however , there remains a clear prospect for deepening relations , including under the framework of the ENP , provided that fundamental reforms are carried out .
at present , a key element - and this is also an issue in EU policy towards Belarus - is to support civil society and the process of democratisation .
in addition , Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from the relevant regional , cross @-@ border and thematic programmes .
the Commission is stepping up its effort to coordinate assistance for democratisation and civil society .
moreover , the Commission is also looking - and here I want go into detail - into the possibility of supporting civil society and the democratic process in a flexible manner .
in the first place , the assistance should be operational and managed in the country concerned .
but the Commission does not exclude specific situations where a project would be implemented mainly outside Belarus .
the modalities for doing so need to be carefully considered in the light of the relevant rules and regulations .
support for independent media and information dissemination is among the key priorities of EU assistance .
a radio or television station broadcasting to Belarus outside the country is an interesting idea , but requires further clarification as to whether such an initiative could be supported by EU funds under the existing rules and regulations .
as to the question of opening a delegation in Belarus , it must be borne in mind that the EU has limited resources for extending its network of fully @-@ fledged delegations .
Belarus is covered by the European Commission delegation in Kiev , which has a technical assistance office in Minsk .
the Commission will look into the possibilities of allocating , within the existing structures , additional human resources for work in Belarus .
at the moment , opening a European Commission delegation in Minsk is not , however , being considered .
Commissioner , I should also like to congratulate you on your first Question Time .
your detailed replies would seem to indicate that the Commission will in fact be working very actively in Belarus .
I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belarussian authorities to be possible , even in the present circumstances ?
. Madam President , there can be no question of us cooperating with the authorities at present .
what we can do , however , and as I mentioned before , is to provide particular support for civil society , and also to focus efforts on working with the academic community .
I can tell you that we are planning to hold three workshops in order to identify exactly what we can do , involving non @-@ governmental organisations and as many neighbouring countries as possible , as we share the view that support for civil society is the only opportunity available to us at present to bring about change in Belarus .
many thanks .
Commissioner , it would seem that it is indeed essential to involve Belarus &apos;s neighbours in efforts to support the development of civil society in that country .
academic programmes and programmes relating to the independent media can only be implemented with the cooperation of neighbouring countries .
I believe that finding projects that might lead to additional funding for such measures would be the best way of ensuring that in future we will be able to establish cooperation with a genuine democratic government in Belarus .
.
first I should like to point out that I have already answered , in principle , the question of the media .
I clearly pointed out the Commission &apos;s opinion for the time being .
however , with regard to projects and money I can give you some examples : the EU &apos;s support for civil society is to be strengthened ; the EU &apos;s TACIS programme - which amounts to EUR 10 million for Belarus in 2005 and 2006 - will focus on support for civil society , independent media - exactly what you wanted us to focus on ; higher education cooperation including exchanges of students and professors ; and alleviation of the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe .
the provision of information to the general public with regard to the European Union and the European Neighbourhood Policy will also be strengthened .
in addition , the Tempus Programme will finance exchanges of young Belarusian university students abroad , curriculum development on European studies and capacity @-@ building in local universities .
as I said , Belarus is indeed eligible under the New Neighbourhood programmes .
it will therefore benefit from the European Neighbourhood Policy instrument as of 2007 .
finally , the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights - the EIDHR - will have a more active role in Belarus in the years to come .
in 2005 @-@ 2006 Belarusian applicants will be able to apply for support under two campaigns : &apos; fostering a culture of human rights &apos; and &apos; promoting democratic processes &apos; .
I should like to know whether the European Commission is aware that these much @-@ needed educational programmes are under the control of the Belarussian authorities , and therefore cannot be regarded as true support for the process of democratisation in Belarus .
I should also like to ask whether , in the light of the Commissioner &apos;s comments , a sum of money will be earmarked under the EIDHR ( European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights ) programme to support independent initiatives in Belarus , bearing in mind that over recent years not a single euro from the fund has yet been set aside for this purpose .
.
as I said before , we will have three workshops .
the last of them will be in Lithuania , which invited the Commission to work together with some neighbouring countries on new ideas and strategies ; on what can be done with NGOs and others .
I will certainly take up this suggestion in those workshops to see what can be done , but it must fit into the framework of the regulations that are there .
however , we will certainly consider that .
questions Nos 38 to 41 will be answered in writing .
questions Nos 39 and 40 lapse , as they are already on the agenda for this part @-@ session .
articles appearing in the highly reputable &apos; Vima &apos; newspaper of 5 and 7 December 2004 reveal the discovery of a telephone tapping network set up by the Italian authorities and used to eavesdrop on mobile and fixed telephone conversations by Greek citizens in Greece .
this has been confirmed in a report produced by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in Bari ( Italy ) and quoted by the newspaper .
it emerges that the network was set up without any court order having been issued by the Greek authorities , while senior Greek police and fraud squad officers indicate that they were tipped off once the network had already been set up by Italian functionaries .
will the Commission request information from the Italian and Greek authorities on this matter ?
does it know whether any form of complaint has been registered to date by the Greek authorities at the eavesdropping by the Italian authorities on Greek citizens without a court order ?
is it admissible , in the absence of a court order by a Member State , for telephone conversations by citizens of that Member State to be monitored by the authorities of another Member State ?
. the Commission has not been informed of any deposition by the Greek authorities concerning any of the facts mentioned by the honourable Member .
since phone taps always require an assessment of the proportionality of the potential infringement of fundamental rights in relation to the public interest served by such measures , permitting phone taps as a means of conducting criminal investigations are in most cases subject to a court warrant .
when the competent authorities of one Member State in the course of criminal investigations in their own country need to carry out taps on phones or telecommunication services located in another Member State they must follow the procedures that have been put in place for that purpose .
the European Commission obviously does not have the means to judge the behaviour of independent judicial authorities .
the main European instrument providing for this situation is the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union .
until such time as this Convention enters into force , Member States can have recourse to the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and to Council of Europe Recommendation ( 85 ) 10 concerning letters rogatory for the interception of telecommunications .
Madam President , Commissioner , I welcome you but you surprise me .
it is incomprehensible that the Commission should avoid commenting on a serious infringement of the basic rules of data protection .
we have had telephone tapping in Greece of Greek citizens by the Italian authorities in the absence of any Greek authorities .
Commissioner , a few weeks ago you were a minister in the Italian Government .
why can you not pick up the telephone and ask both the Italian and the Greek Government what happened ?
. I would like to apologise to Mr Papadimoulis , but I can only repeat that the Commission has not received any information about this case .
at any rate , the Commission does not have the legal right to rule on a breach which , if committed , would have been committed by an independent judicial authority and not by a governmental authority of a Member State .
there are legal instruments available , which I pointed out : in particular , Council of Europe recommendations and the Council of Europe &apos;s Convention on Mutual Assistance .
- Madam President , Commissioner , I think there has been another mistake here or something has escaped you .
last December , the and newspapers reported extensively on telephone tapping ; they even had special diagrams of a device which perpetrates this crime , in or out of inverted commas .
this device exists somewhere in Milan or southern Italy .
I wonder , therefore , how is it that you too have not yet found out about it , so that you can make the relevant observations today .
. of course , what Mr Mavrommatis said is correct .
the Italian newspapers have reported certain facts ; nevertheless the Commission can and must remain within the scope of its legal powers , which do not include the power to subject the behaviour of judicial authorities to investigations or actions .
there are instruments , including within the national states , which allow a judge who has carried out an illegal activity to be prosecuted , but that clearly cannot happen at the request of the Commission .
Commissioner , regardless of the facts of this case , when you next meet the justice ministers , will you make it clear to them that , under the various international conventions you mention and in the spirit of membership of the European Union , it is unacceptable for the authorities of one Member State - be they political or judicial - to carry out phone tapping in another Member State , without the express approval of that Member State ?
. Mr Martin , you are absolutely correct and this is certainly the right path to take .
as you are probably aware , in Italy it falls on the one hand to the Minister for Justice and , on the other , to the judiciary &apos;s self @-@ governing body to take action against judges who commit illegal acts .
I have naturally passed this request on to the Italian Minister for Justice .
what is the Commission &apos;s view on reactions to the Commission &apos;s annual report on Migration ( July 2004 ) , including the view of experts such as SOLIDAR ( Katrin Hugendubel ) and the Social Platform of NGOs that it is difficult to establish &apos; best practice &apos; on integration policy when the contexts of each EU Member State are so different ?
. it is certainly true that there are different approaches to integration represented in the Member States .
concept and practice varies due to a number of factors : different immigration histories and variations in the roles of government and civil society with respect to integration policies are just two examples .
the Commission consistently stressed that integration policy was by definition an area where subsidiarity is at stake .
on the other hand , all Member States adhere to human rights standards and shared values such as equality anti @-@ discrimination , solidarity , tolerance , etc ..
through the ongoing exchange of information and experience , particularly through the work of national contact points for integration , we are now seeing a certain degree of convergence with respect to policy approaches , goals and targets .
this was confirmed in December with the adoption by the Council of common basic principles on integration .
the publication by the Commission in November 2004 of a handbook on integration for policy makers and practitioners , which brings together examples of good practice from throughout the Union on introduction programmes , civic participation and integration indicators , illustrates that there are many common problems and shows how much we can learn from each other .
best practice must be taken for what it is : ideas , lessons to be learned and suggestions which can inspire and inform policy makers in the definition of the policies required .
I thank the Commissioner for that clear answer .
I know from the previous debate that you take the issue of integration seriously .
the Commission has a real impact on integration policy and a direct role , for example , in the enforcement of existing directives , which are crucial to integration - I refer explicitly to the Employment Directive and the Race Equality Directive .
the Commission has played a strong role in trying to enforce these directives .
they remain unimplemented in at least two Member States that I am aware of .
will you use your powers in office to enforce such directives , which play such an important part in the integration process ?
you have that power .
. yes , of course the Commission has such power , and I can reassure you that the Commission will use all its power to guarantee , stimulate and encourage Member States to fully implement all directives in the common European interest .
Commissioner , I shall speak in your mother tongue in order to be forthright with regard to an old question : illegal immigration .
the landings of illegal immigrants will certainly not wait for us to come up with a common strategy before they resume in the Mediterranean .
certainly , the only reason they are not continuing at the moment as well is because the poor wretches are lying on the seabed .
so I would like to ask , what is the Commission doing and what has been planned for the near future to help countries on the borders of the European Union - I am referring in particular to my country , Malta - in order to provide aid and to receive illegal immigrants in a proper manner ?
what level of funding will be allocated for this ?
. the question of illegal immigration is one which the Commission considers to be a priority .
while we are preparing political actions and common European solutions , as you pointed out , we must also address the daily tragedy of desperate people .
the Commission can and must take action , and it will , in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of persons entering European territory are respected , obviously including those who enter illegally : the right to respect for human life and dignity is not a question of legal differences .
having said that , we must speed up the strategic policies .
we cannot take advantage of a delay and thereby continue to allow an illegal influx , but we must immediately respect the fundamental rights of individuals and at the same time prepare common policies on reception , on the one hand , and the prevention of illegal activities , on the other .
in the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the fight against terrorism , the Member States were required to pass legislation in a number of areas related to combating terrorism , with a view to establishing common definitions in the face of the threats in question .
Article 11 of this framework decision called on the Commission and Council to make an assessment by the end of 2003 of the forms of implementation by the Member States of specific anti @-@ terrorism measures .
these texts were finally submitted by the Commission ( 8 June 2004 - COM ( 2004 ) 0409 / final ) and the Council ( 12 October 2004 - 11687 / 2 / 04 / rev.2 ) .
both reports stress , in clear and objective fashion , the passivity of the Member States and their failure to comply with the objectives set out in the Council framework decision .
the Commission does not possess binding legal instruments to oblige the Member States to comply with framework decisions .
despite this and with a view to ensuring the EU &apos;s credibility in the fight against terrorism , can the Commission state how it intends to promote and obtain a genuine anti @-@ terrorist policy at Union level and ensure that the Member States act on their promises regarding legislative action ?
. according to Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union , framework decisions are binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods .
however , framework decisions &apos; shall not entail direct effect &apos; .
whereas , within the first pillar , the Commission has the authority to initiate an infringement procedure against a Member State , this possibility does not exist within the Treaty on European Union .
the situation described by the honourable Member certainly does not facilitate the Commission &apos;s role , but it does not prevent it from producing a broad range of policy initiatives , which have been the basis for the policy definition of the Union in the important area of the fight against terrorism .
the Commission has been playing this role very actively in establishing in June 2004 the revised action plan on combating terrorism , in updating it in December 2004 and in implementing more than half of the respective measures .
this is also evident from the submission , in October 2004 , of four communications covering different aspects of the prevention , preparedness and response to terrorist attacks and from the adoption , in the same year , of a communication on mutual access to data relevant to the fight against terrorism and of several classified documents in the field of consequence management and the protection of critical infrastructures .
the Commission in general and President Barroso and I in particular are determined to work in close cooperation with Council presidencies to maintain the fight against terrorism .
this is very high on the agenda of the Council , including that of the JHA Council and the European Council comprising the Heads of State and Government .
I am well aware of the legal framework in which the European anti @-@ terrorism policy can operate as far as the Commission is concerned and you described it very well .
if , however , we do not wish to demonstrate collective hypocrisy , we need to say how things stand .
and the way they stand is that we have major conferences , with all the Heads of Government present , and afterwards they have a press conference , set out a decision and following this decision nothing happens .
the Commission itself admitted as much on 8 June 2004 .
the question is , therefore : what is the Commission going to do in political terms to put the policy into practice ?
. the Commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implementation of the Hague Programme at the informal meeting of the Ministers for Internal Affairs and for Justice at the end of the month .
the action plan will be presented in May this year and I hope that it will be adopted by the European Council in June .
the action plan on combating terrorism will contain tangible measures and guidelines , precise deadlines for the Member States and binding obligations for a common policy to enhance cooperation , information exchange and protection for the victims of terrorist attacks .
these are the measures that the Commission initially intends to put before Parliament , something which we shall do at the beginning of February , that is , well before we draw up our proposal , and we shall then listen to Parliament &apos;s opinion on the concrete proposals .
what progress is the Commission making towards proposing a standardised set of criteria for the reporting of crimes and collection of statistics about crimes across the European Union ?
until such a system is established , it is difficult for law enforcement officers to have a clear picture of the extent of organised criminal activity , and it is therefore very difficult to counter the gangs effectively .
. the Commission agrees that the absence of comparable crime statistics makes the development of an effective EU law enforcement policy more difficult .
the Commission is working on a draft action plan on EU crime statistics .
Member State crime statistics experts are being consulted on this draft action plan , which will be presented in the form of a Commission communication in the spring of 2005 .
the two main blocks of the draft action plan are : first , the setting up of appropriate coordination machinery to ensure that Member States , the Commission and other key actors are part of the process of working towards common data @-@ gathering methods and harmonised definition ; the second element concerns the implementation of developing comparable statistics .
this will include many different components , to be developed over a period of time , such as definitions of crime types and an inventory of definitions where there is already EU @-@ level agreement .
the Commission , in close cooperation with Europol and other providers and users of EU crime statistics , is developing this project on a step @-@ by @-@ step basis in accordance with Member States &apos; ability to provide relevant data .
the Commission &apos;s draft action plan was discussed with European directors of social statistics in September 2004 .
it was agreed to set up a task force to examine appropriate statistical methods for monitoring crime .
this task force will begin its work in May 2005 .
I should also mention that the Commission is providing support for work being undertaken to measure statistically the quality and effectiveness of the judicial process .
a seminar on this subject , co @-@ financed by the EU &apos;s AGIS Programme , was hosted by the Italian Ministry of Justice in Rome in October 2004 .
thank you , Commissioner , for staying to answer the question .
I am very grateful that you recognise the urgency of this problem because with open borders across the Union , organised crime is free to operate and to prosper , while our police forces are national and cannot cross the frontiers .
so we have a real problem .
I am glad that you are treating this with considerable urgency .
could you tell us who will be responsible for the coordinating machinery ?
will this be done by Europol or will it be done by the Commission - or maybe a new agency ?
. I do not think that we can or should create new bodies ; I think that on the one hand the Commission should give strategic , or rather political direction to this sector and , on the other hand , the sector should have the chance to find different ways to use Europol , which as we all know is trying to extend its duties and its remit .
the Commission intends to encourage this progression , this expansion of Europol &apos;s duties .
this is undoubtedly one of the sectors where work can be done .
Madam President , I would like to make a few remarks : some of my fellow Members , like myself , have been here since the start of the sitting , have submitted written questions and have not had the opportunity of receiving a reply in the Chamber which they could then counter with a further question , whether they were satisfied or not .
the Bureau and the legal departments should better consider the matter of Question Time and give proper thought as to the time allotted and how many questions can be answered in that time , because we cannot oblige a Member to stay in the Chamber all this time and then not have the satisfaction of receiving an immediate , direct reply from the competent Commissioner .
the situation deserves to be looked into by Parliament &apos;s administration .
it is absolutely intolerable for a situation of this kind to arise .
Mrs Sbarbati , the Rules of Procedure lay down quite clear rules for the holding of Question Time .
a great many Members asked to speak on a certain topic earlier , and I could not give the floor to everyone .
in my opinion , the main problem is that many Members spend a long time asking supplementary questions , and do not abide by the 30 @-@ second time limit , which of course means that we are often delayed .
I will , however , bear your comments in mind .
I should like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone , and especially to Commissioner Frattini again for being prepared to remain so long in the Chamber with us for Question Time .
questions Nos 46 to 76 will be answered in writing .
Mr President , I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure .
we saw this House spied on in a disgraceful manner during the last election period , and it appears that this is already happening again , in that I heard yesterday that at least one attendance list from December 2004 was given - I stress given - to a Member in order that he might make a copy of it .
there are two questions I would like to ask about this .
firstly , is there any basis in fact for what I have been told ?
secondly , if there is , is there any basis in law for this being done ?
I am not sure whether this is exactly a point of order , but , in any event , I can reply by saying that the Bureau has already looked into this issue , which has been communicated to the legal services , and we are awaiting a report from those services so that we can act accordingly .
the next item is the Council Statement on the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Juncker , Prime Minister of Luxembourg , has the floor , and I would like once again to express Parliament &apos;s sadness at the death of her Royal Highness , the Grand Duchess Josephine @-@ Charlotte of Luxembourg , Princess of Belgium .
.
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must say , it is always a pleasure to come to Strasbourg , the very embodiment of the European city , a city that symbolises the reconciliation between France and Germany , a meeting point for so many European ambitions and an intersection of so many continental dreams .
in addition to my pleasure at being here , I have the honour today to present to Parliament - the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe - the priorities for the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union . the Luxembourg Presidency follows that of our Dutch friends .
I must pay heartfelt tribute to their hard work , their tenacity and their undeniable successes .
the EU made significant progress under the Dutch Presidency .
when it comes to an end , I hope to be able to say the same of the eleventh Luxembourg Presidency , which began a few days ago .
the experience of our previous presidencies might indeed prove to be valuable , but presidencies come and go and have different characteristics .
when I was President of the Council of Ministers for the first time , in 1985 , there were ten Members of the European Communities ; when I was President in 1991 , there were 12 ministers around the table ; when I took over the Presidency in 1997 , there were fifteen of us , and now there are 25 Member States .
in 20 years the number of Member States has more than doubled .
the decision @-@ making system has naturally become more complicated .
what a joy and a pleasure , however , to see the countries of Eastern and Central Europe take their place in the EU , in view of the fateful decree that sought to drive a wedge between us for ever .
the experience of our various presidencies and of observing the successive presidencies of other countries has taught me two things .
firstly , the EU will not genuinely move forward if those holding the Presidency place their own national interests at the heart of their concerns rather than replacing them with the common interest , the best definition of the interests of everyone .
it follows that the EU will not find genuine coherence , let alone harmony , unless we all respect the spirit and the letter of the Community method and the balance between the three institutions .
the Commission is not a touch judge solely in charge of monitoring compliance with the rules of the internal market .
it should be the playmaker , the inspiration and the driving force of the team .
the Council , for its part , is not the field of play of exclusively national interests , however justified those may be , but rather a workshop of understanding .
the place of Parliament , for its part , is not that of a spectator watching from the stands .
it is an actor with privileged status because it is legitimised by universal suffrage .
you will , therefore , see me regularly in your offices , in your meetings and in your corridors in Brussels and Strasbourg .
I say this for myself , for my ministers and for all those who work in the service of Parliament , and thus in your service .
together we must oversee the ratification of the new Constitutional Treaty in the right conditions .
it is true that the draft Constitution is not perfect , but we must not benchmark it against perfection ; we must benchmark it against what Europe will need in order to remain an example to the world in the future .
let us do now what must be done in order for this to be the case in the future and let us ratify the Treaty .
let us not forget that the Treaty is a text that is of neither the left nor the right .
its content will be the fruit of our convictions , of our will and of our ambition .
if our will and our ambition are perfect , the implementation of the new Treaty , which may be imperfect in theory , will probably be perfectly successful in practice .
the ratification of the Treaty will not be an easy task everywhere , and I have one major concern in this regard : let us not use the potential difficulties of the parliamentary ratifications and referendums as an excuse to slacken the pace of action or to avoid making decisions .
let us not put off the most difficult decisions until the day after the first referendum , then until the day after the second referendum , then until the day after the third referendum , and so on .
when we ask for the approval of the peoples and the parliaments of Europe , let us show them that Europe works , that Europe is on the move , that Europe is decisive and that Europe is capable of fulfilling its responsibilities .
if the EU takes decisive action it can win over the doubters ; if it is inactive it can put doubts in the minds of those previously convinced .
Mr President , when the new Presidency takes up its duties there is usually a solemn atmosphere , but that has been overshadowed this year by the terrible tragedy of the seaquake in South @-@ east Asia .
the deeply distressing pictures of the dead , the injured and the devastation cast a giant shadow over the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005 .
this tragedy will linger long in the memory and I hope that , in addition to the immediate emergency aid , we shall show lasting solidarity with the devastated peoples and regions of Asia .
I should also like us to ensure that the misery that we are seeing in Asia today does not make us turn our backs on the poverty , the underdevelopment , the hunger and the death of innocent people elsewhere .
our hearts should be in places where the television cameras are no longer or have never been .
Mr President , the European security strategy encourages us to promote peace , democracy and stability in the fight against the root causes of insecurity in the world .
it is absolutely crucial that , in a coherent and coordinated fashion , we use the entire range of EU instruments in the Western Balkans , in the Middle East , in our relations with Russia and Ukraine and in our transatlantic relations .
the future of the Balkans , a region still traumatised by its recent past , must form part of Europe &apos;s outlook .
the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia in March 2005 , provided that there has been confirmation of complete cooperation with the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , will demonstrate to all Balkan countries that their efforts towards democracy will be rewarded and might bear more fruit .
for the other countries in the region , the EU &apos;s general action framework will continue to fall under the guidelines of the Thessaloniki Agenda , which sets out the European perspective presented to the Balkan countries .
the Presidency will hold talks with Albania on a stabilisation and association agreement .
a further crucial milestone in the region will be a review in mid @-@ 2005 of the implementation of the standards policy in Kosovo .
we shall be paying close attention to the developing situation in Kosovo .
I am of the opinion that , whatever its status , Kosovo &apos;s future rests within the EU .
the Russian Federation is a strategic partner of the EU and remains a major factor in European security and stability .
admittedly , the state of our relations is not satisfactory at the moment .
I shall do all that I can to remedy this state of affairs , whilst remaining firm on our core demands .
I trust I can count on your support in this endeavour .
at the EU @-@ Russia Summit in Moscow on 10 May , the Presidency will strive for a balanced package as regards the Four Common Spaces set out at the St Petersburg Summit , which are based on common values and shared interests .
the EU will forge close ties with the new President of Ukraine , not least in areas such as the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
we have every interest in having a stable and prosperous Ukraine as a neighbour , a Ukraine that is strongly rooted in democracy , a Ukraine that is committed to the path of modernisation .
the Presidency will prepare thoroughly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place during the United Kingdom Presidency .
I shall now turn to transatlantic relations .
for the world to be a stable place , it needs a transatlantic partnership that works .
at the moment , transatlantic relations are not bad , but nor are they particularly good .
leaving matters as they are , however , is not an option that will satisfy expectations on both sides of the Atlantic .
consequently , we must improve the quality of relations in the best interests of both parties .
we shall do this at the two Summits with President Bush - the first in February , at the US President &apos;s request , and the second in June .
we shall not focus on the differences of opinion that some of us may have had with the United States in the recent past , but we shall try to put the emphasis on a series of practical questions to which we must give equally practical answers .
transatlantic relations would not be complete without Canada , and I am delighted that there is to be a summit with Canada during my Presidency , in which we shall be discussing matters of shared importance between friends .
the same applies , on the other side of the world , to our Japanese friends .
at this point , Mr President , I should like to say a word about the Middle East .
with the election of President Abbas on 9 January as head of the Palestinian Authority , and with the prospect of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , a window of opportunity has opened up to relaunch the peace process and to speed up the implementation of the road map .
that opportunity must now be seized .
against this backdrop , I should like to offer my support to the Middle East conference due to take place in London in March 2005 .
this , I am sure , will represent an essential step towards consolidating the peace process .
under the Luxembourg Presidency , the process of EU enlargement will be guided by the decisions taken by the European Council of last December .
we shall be opening accession negotiations with Turkey in March .
as regards Bulgaria and Romania , I hope that Parliament will issue its assent in April on the accession of those two countries , which will enable us to sign accession Treaties , also in April .
Mr President , we cannot bring the EU closer to its citizens if we remain incapable of meeting their justifiable expectations as regards internal security .
the new Constitutional Treaty paves the way towards definitively abolishing the &apos; Justice and Home Affairs exception , &quot; in other words the complete integration of this field into the European Project by means of the rigorous application of the Community method .
under our Presidency , justice and home affairs activities will be in line with this perspective , and our working basis will fall within the framework of the excellent Hague Programme , adopted by the Council in November of last year .
in order to ensure that the area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality , we must think European before we think national .
we must ensure that a European security culture is developed .
this is a particularly important requirement as regards the fight against serious and organised crime .
driving forward the area of freedom , security and justice is in our view an essential , even existential , task .
we must first , however , optimise operational cooperation between the Member States ; for example , we must ensure that information can be exchanged quickly and smoothly between Member States &quot; police forces and judiciaries .
this principle of availability will constitute a major step forward in cooperation between police forces and the Presidency will set about this task at the earliest opportunity .
we also wish to strengthen the European judicial area , which is based on both mutual recognition and the approximation of laws .
we shall ensure , in particular , that negotiations are driven forward on the European evidence warrant and on the possible establishment of a European criminal record .
this will make European security stronger and will not be to the detriment of public freedoms , nor must it be , since those freedoms form part of the European way of coexistence .
the fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority .
in this regard , I wish to salute the Spanish initiative to host a meeting of the Heads of State or Government in Madrid in March .
the Presidency , for its part , will place particular emphasis on combating the financing of terrorism .
as far as the strand of asylum and immigration is concerned , the Presidency will focus on three elements : strengthening partnerships with countries of origin and of transit ; establishing a harmonised approach with regard to the policy of return and readmission ; and the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders begins its duties on 1 May .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we often refer - and rightly so - to the Europe of the citizens .
let us not be under any illusions .
if we do not succeed in making the EU an area of work and well @-@ being for all , the citizens will become alienated from Europe , from its Union and from the political project that underpins it .
in order to stave off that risk and to give Europe back its economic and social place , we launched the Lisbon Strategy almost five years ago .
we wanted - and we still want - to make the EU the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy in the world , capable of sustained economic growth , with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion , and one that respects the environment and natural resources .
after five years of qualified success , the time has come for a mid @-@ term review , which we shall draw up for the spring European Council .
the first task will be to clarify the aim of the strategy that we are to pursue .
the Lisbon Strategy - a name that , to my mind , means absolutely nothing to most people - is in fact a strategy for competitiveness , growth , social cohesion and the protection of the environment .
it should be based on solid foundations of sustainable well @-@ being for Europeans .
we must act now in order , in the future , to guarantee access for all to the European social model , which must not be turned into a myth , but should remain , or rather , should return to being , a living reality for all .
if we want to keep the European social model intact , it must be reformed so that it can provide a response to the growth crisis , to under @-@ employment , to the weakening of the fabric of society , to the loss of competitiveness and productivity , to the falling birth @-@ rate and to the ageing of our populations .
naturally , Europeans do not like reforms ; they are scared by them and do not understand the reasons behind them .
we must explain to them that the reforms that we are proposing are intended to guarantee the survival and the viability of the European social model .
we must convince them that putting off those reforms would prove more expensive .
we must prove to them that we are right to act and would be wrong to do nothing .
the bottom line is that we need to reinvigorate Europe .
the next step , when we draw up the mid @-@ term review , is to keep together the three pillars of the Strategy - the economic , the social and the environmental .
I am well aware that Europe has a competitiveness problem , which largely explains its mediocre performance in terms of growth and jobs .
of course competitiveness must be stepped up .
it is not , however , an end in itself , nor some neutral , self @-@ sufficient benefit .
no , the competitiveness that we must seek should provide us with stronger and more sustainable growth and should be aimed at greater social cohesion and a more harmoniously @-@ balanced environment .
please let us not start a foolish and pointless debate over whether we should have more competitiveness and thus less social cohesion , or more social , and less environmental , cohesion .
if Europe wishes to be strong , it needs three things , and those three things go together : greater competitiveness , greater social cohesion and a better @-@ balanced natural environment .
I say yes to competitiveness ; I say no to giving up our social and ecological ambitions .
I say yes , for example , to opening up service markets , but I say no to social dumping , an element that some people would like to promote .
the bottom line , Mr President , is that we must find the right way of ensuring that the strategy is successful .
after five years of charting a rudderless course between success and failure , it is not so much a matter of knowing what we must do - because after all we do know - it is more a matter of knowing how we are to go about it .
it is essential that we make the European learning area a reality , step up the research effort , improve our education systems and foster lifelong learning .
this is what we must do , but how do we go about it ?
we have far too many processes in Europe .
we have the broad economic policy guidelines , the employment guidelines , the sustainable development strategy , the internal market strategy , the small and medium @-@ sized business charter , the Cologne process , the Cardiff process , and many others .
all too often , these processes become bogged down in bureaucratic procedures that lead nowhere .
the EU is more like a research unit - a unit of unused research , at that - than a factory of ideas that are practical and are put into practice .
we must change this by streamlining our strategy .
our strategy is essentially European , but its implementation must first be national .
we should like this strategy to remain essentially European .
it must be subject to a broad review every two years , or preferably every three years .
we cannot change strategy every six months , from Council to Council , according to the whims of the presidencies and to what is inspiring them at the time .
the strategy must be there for the long haul .
we should like implementation at national level to be speeded up and stepped up . we are proposing that Member States should set up action programmes at national level .
these should be designed in conjunction with the social partners and must be presented to national parliaments , which , along with the Community bodies , would monitor their implementation .
these national programmes would take account of the particular national and regional characteristics and should provide the possibility for assessing the pace and intensity of the respective national reforms separately and should make it easier to gauge the level of performance achieved up to a given point .
so much for the strategy and the way in which it is to be implemented .
we shall discuss this matter again together , Parliament , the Council and both of us with the Commission , which will soon present its summary report to us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the partial reorientation of the Lisbon Strategy also invites us to reflect on the Growth and Stability Pact .
I beg your pardon , the Stability and Growth Pact !
actually , I would have preferred it the other way round .
yet as Europe was governed in 1996 by our old friends - and not the ones you would think ! - the second order was the one that was kept .
we began a review of the Pact under the Dutch Presidency and we should like to conclude it under the Luxembourg Presidency .
we are going to reform the Pact , or rather , to adjust its implementing measures .
let me explain this by first detailing what we are not going to do .
economic and Monetary Union needs stability .
we therefore have no intention of driving stability away , neither in what we say nor in what we do .
stability is a founding element of the pact that forms the basis of the euro .
we promised a stable currency .
it will remain stable and it will remain strong .
it follows - let me say right away - that the Presidency will not propose to neutralise or immunise certain categories of budgetary spending applicable under the Pact .
it follows that the basic criteria - 3 % for the deficit , 60 % for the debt - will remain applicable .
it is clear to me , however , that changes must be made , not least in order that the Pact can take better account of the economic cycle .
during times of strong economic growth , Member States in the euro zone must , as a matter of priority , be required to allocate budget surpluses to reducing the debt and the deficit .
we shall enrich the preventative element of the Pact by means of a strong dose of extra stability .
during times of weak growth , on the other hand , Member States in the euro zone should be given more reactive room for manoeuvre as regards the budget .
the greater the efforts to reduce the deficit and the debt during periods of economic expansion , the wider that room for manoeuvre .
if , during periods of weak growth , a Member State incurs an excessive deficit , this situation and the consequences arising from it , not least in terms of the timing of correction , will be judged by means of objective measures of assessment .
we must avoid at all costs arbitrary political judgments that might lead to differing assessments based on the size of the country .
from this perspective , Luxembourg is always the loser .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , we shall have a proper debate when the time comes , in committee , without too many witnesses , on the comparison that could be made between France , Germany and Luxembourg as regards taxation .
it is a debate that will be interesting and informative for those who , I must say , view Luxembourg in a somewhat superficial manner .
let me invite you to a calm debate about the Pact .
I am wary of extreme solutions .
I say no to those who seek to replace stability with brazen , unbridled flexibility , as well as to those who seek to set the Pact , as it is now , in the cement of dogma .
we need greater stability and greater flexibility to take account of the economic cycle .
Mr President , you would no doubt be surprised if I failed to mention the debate that we are to hold on the financial perspectives .
in front of you , I would not wish to detail the component parts of this - it must be said - difficult dossier , because your grasp of them is better than mine .
I shall simply say that the Luxembourg Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June .
I am not under any illusions , however .
the Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time , by which I mean now !
if we do not reach an agreement on a common position under the Luxembourg Presidency , by 1 January 2007 , it will be politically , legislatively and technically impossible to meet the challenge of the enlarged EU .
consequently , no institution or Member State will have any interest in playing extra time .
the absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency &apos;s failure , which is only of very minor interest to me , but Europe &apos;s failure . let us decide .
let us decide quickly .
let us decide now .
we must spare Europe a long , drawn @-@ out debate lasting 18 months or even more .
that would cause even more disputes and exacerbate the conflicts between the Member States and the institutions .
Mr President , I am relying on Parliament to drive forward the decision @-@ making process on the financial perspectives .
we shall work with you , because your agreement is necessary .
you will not be handed a , I guarantee you that .
that , Mr President , is the thrust of our programme .
presidencies come and go , but fortunately Europe remains .
we want to serve Europe with determination and passion , with the determination and the passion that long distances and grand ambitions require .
given the applause you have received , we can expect the Luxembourg Presidency to be very positive .
that is what Parliament wants to see .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the half @-@ year that has just begun will feature a series of important landmarks that will determine whether the EU will be able to meet the objective of achieving a higher level of prosperity , solidarity and security for the citizens .
much of what the Commission may accomplish during the coming years will be determined by the initial decisions taken during this term and by our capacity to resolve difficult questions and to achieve practical results .
I should therefore like to highlight , from the Commission &apos;s perspective , the particular importance of this Luxembourg Presidency in this first half @-@ year of 2005 .
accordingly , the Commission will table the programme for the period 2004 @-@ 2009 as early as 26 January .
we hope that the other institutions can agree to this programme so that it can become not just part of the Commission &apos;s programme , but part of the programme for the entire Union , thus anticipating the provisions of the European Constitution , and we can then begin right away to work within the spirit of the Constitution .
Luxembourg has the responsibility of chairing the Council during this crucial period .
I feel that it is a privilege for us to have Prime Minister Juncker as President of the Council during this period , given his invaluable experience as Head of Government , his deeply @-@ held European conviction and his well @-@ known ability to resolve tricky situations .
from a personal point of view , it is a pleasure for me to work with my friend Jean @-@ Claude Juncker .
Mr President , we have heard from the Presidency about its expectations and priorities .
let me comment briefly on just three of the main issues that will be on the agenda of the Luxembourg Presidency ; there are many others , but I wish to concentrate on three .
the first is the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon Strategy .
Europe is facing very important challenges , most of which were already identified at Lisbon 2000 .
but we could say today that the challenges from globalisation and the ageing of the population make even clearer the need to adapt to increasingly difficult situations .
Europe &apos;s prosperity is under threat .
to tackle this threat we need more growth and more jobs .
if we continue on the path of low , diminishing economic growth , we put all our policies at risk , but in particular our capacity to ensure solidarity and security and to preserve and improve the European model .
as outlined in the Kok report , to be more effective the Lisbon priorities need to be refocused , streamlined and prioritised .
too many priorities means no priority at all .
growth and jobs must be our priorities .
the Commission is working on a report which will present its views on the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon Strategy and propose guidelines for future action .
at this point in the preparation of this report , two elements strike me as particularly consensual .
the first is the knowledge economy .
returning to growth will require considerable investment in knowledge .
companies cannot become more competitive without a better @-@ prepared labour force . only well @-@ trained people can ensure high productivity .
this requires unprecedented effort in the areas of research , development , education and training .
particular effort will be required to involve young people in this investment for knowledge .
higher productivity should lead to higher growth , which , in turn , would create more jobs .
I do not see knowledge purely as an instrument for other objectives : knowledge in itself is an important goal and a vehicle for self @-@ realisation .
the second consensual point I can underline at this stage is about coherence in implementation , the delivery problem .
the coherence between national actions and European action is a critical factor for success .
this means better implementation of the objectives agreed in common , which , in turn , means more responsibility and more empowerment at national level to deliver the common objectives .
in this vein , the Commission report will also highlight clearly the importance of ensuring ownership of the revised Lisbon Strategy by the Member States .
all in all , I must stress that the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon Strategy is , first , an agenda for modernisation .
whether we will succeed depends on our ability to establish an effective partnership between our institutions and citizens to deliver this reform .
I should now like to present to you our view of the financial perspectives .
the Luxembourg Presidency has rightly decided to put everything into striving to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives before the end of June 2005 .
it is right to do so , because failure to reach an agreement in time will lead to significant difficulties for the preparation of the programmes concerned .
it strikes me as important , however - at a time when a final negotiation might get underway - to point out certain salient facts .
we cannot have more Europe with fewer financial resources .
the Commission &apos;s proposal has not fallen out of the sky ; it is the result of commitments agreed by the EU during the European Councils .
nowadays , the Commission does not ask that the Union be granted funding for new projects , but usually that it be granted funding for commitments already made ; Member States must honour the commitments that they have already made .
I should like , if I may , to point out certain issues on which I feel that the Union must not compromise .
the first of these is cohesion .
ladies and gentlemen , without solidarity there is no Union .
there might be something else , but not a Union .
enlargement has had a far @-@ reaching impact on solidarity .
the Union has new regions lagging behind in development , and some of the less prosperous old regions still need support .
financial solidarity is therefore all the more necessary given that regions lagging behind in development have the greatest scope for growth in competitiveness and job creation .
we must not disappoint the new EU Members , which have the right to active solidarity from the entire Union .
secondly , we must not forget the question of competitiveness .
with regard to the Lisbon Strategy , I said that massive investment in research and education was essential .
indeed , European level expenditure very often brings more reward than national level expenditure without coherence .
I should also add trans @-@ European networks to the list of priorities , given that the infrastructure that connects Europe is still in decline .
the third crucial aspect of the financial perspectives is that of security .
the action programme agreed at the European Council has major financial implications .
the programme known as the &apos; Hague Programme &quot; has financial implications .
this means more action at European level so that the financial burden and collective security can be shared better among the Member States .
the citizens of Europe expect us to have the ability to work together .
one Member State on its own , even the most powerful , cannot guarantee the best possible security if it does not form part of a joint , European @-@ level effort .
the bottom line is that we cannot have more Europe with less money .
I hear people from time to time calling for a freeze on Community budgets below the level of the 2006 budget .
let us be clear on this matter : that would be a Europe that reneges on its commitments .
I wish to state clearly that the Commission would wish to have nothing to do with a Europe of backtracking , a Europe of mediocrity , a Europe of reduced aims .
this is why I am delighted that the Luxembourg Presidency will do everything in its power to reach a compromise agreement this term .
some people will say that this will be difficult , even unlikely .
I honestly believe that the longer we leave this , the more difficult it will be .
we therefore support the Luxembourg Presidency in this difficult , yet extremely important , task .
as for the Stability and Growth Pact , we welcome the fact that one of the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s priorities is to ensure that multilateral budgetary monitoring will make a greater contribution to a strong , healthy and successful economic and monetary Union .
these principles underpin the Stability and Growth Pact and this Pact must be respected and must function properly .
let us not forget that the single currency is one of Europe &apos;s great achievements .
I remember before the euro came into force , certain experts , economists and professors , particularly on the other side of the Atlantic , were saying that Europe would never be able to have a strong currency because of its lack of solidarity and political cohesion .
nowadays , some are saying that our currency might be too strong , but not too weak .
the single currency is therefore an historic European success story .
we must not now jeopardise that great success .
at the end of 2003 , the Commission initiated a reflection process on the experience that has been gained , in order to identify possible changes and improvements that might help us to implement the Pact more efficiently .
convinced that the common interest commands that everybody comply with every rule , the Commission has been in contact with the various European bodies responsible for thinking together and for exploring together the most promising avenues , such as those tabled in our Communication of September 2004 .
the Presidency &apos;s contribution will be instrumental in engendering a consensus of opinion .
we are already expecting such a consensus at the Ecofin Council on 18 January .
the Commission will thus be able to put forward practical proposals to improve the implementation of the Pact and this in time for the discussions at the European Council in March .
in the next six months , the ability of the European Union to return to growth will be put to the test .
it will have to provide the financial means necessary to match its political choices .
it must work closer to citizens and regain their trust .
it must strengthen its role on the international scene and relaunch its strategic partnerships .
there is now a special opportunity for relaunching the Middle East peace process .
the European Union can and should give a greater contribution in this field .
I believe that the European Union will play a stronger role on the international scene .
the Commission strongly supports the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency on this path .
the Commission believes that this period is critical and that our institutions will need to work together even more closely to achieve results .
. Mr President , Mr President of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome to the House today the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission , and I gather that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission unveils its programme in Brussels on 26 January .
I see that as a splendid symbol for the ever @-@ growing cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
future presidencies should take that as an example to follow .
although we were very pleased to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia , visiting Jakarta as an expression of the European Union &apos;s solidarity , I would like to emphasise that , however necessary solidarity with the stricken areas might be , we must not overlook the great problems in Africa and in other parts of the world .
we have to consider how we can , in so far as we are able , take preventive measures , in the shape of an early warning system , in Europe too , for example in the Mediterranean .
we are very much behind you , Mr President of the Council , in what you had to say about the Community method .
Luxembourg may well be small in geographical terms , but it is a Grand Duchy and hence a great country , and the Benelux states &quot; presidencies have always been excellent ones .
we wish you great success ; for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats too , the Constitution is of the utmost priority .
in Brussels , we will have in @-@ depth discussions on the Lisbon strategy , even though making the European economy competitive is not an end in itself , for the fact is that a strong economy is the best guarantee of good social policy .
we see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in Europe by way of growth and better conditions for European businesses .
for us , that is social policy in the true sense of the word .
rather than setting ecology and the protection of the environment against the economy , we need a sensible balance between them .
we also wish you and your presidency success in handling the financial perspective .
to those ladies and gentlemen - in this instance , no doubt , only gentlemen - who wrote letters arguing in favour of the 1 % limit , we would say that you cannot enlarge Europe and then refuse the EU &apos;s new Member States the money that is an expression of our solidarity , and which they need in order to be brought up to our standards .
to do that , we in the European Union need the necessary funding to be made available .
you have mentioned the treaties that are to be signed , but how , in the absence of any agreement by June and of any success in medium @-@ term financial planning , are we to cope with the accession of new states to the European Union ?
we are very glad that it is Reimer Böge , a very competent member of our group , who will be writing the report for this House .
you also made reference to the Stability Pact .
I am very grateful to you for what you said , and I can agree with every word of it .
what you said boils down , in essence , to the need for more flexibility .
the thing about flexibility is that it is those states that have made provisions that have more of it .
to come to the point , then , the less indebted a state is , the more flexible it can be when times are hard for the economy , which also means that we have to do what has to be done to reduce deficits when things are going well for the economy , for we know that today &apos;s debts always end up being tomorrow &apos;s taxes , and a burden on the public as a whole , particularly on the younger generation .
let me just say something briefly about foreign policy issues , a number of which you have addressed , and - as I understand it - the President of the Commission is in full agreement with what you said .
our support for Ukraine is only just beginning and will have to be an ongoing responsibility .
if I may turn to Palestine , where elections have just taken place , we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state .
the European Union &apos;s role must not - contrary to what we are told by not a few high @-@ ranking representatives from the Middle East - be merely a matter of providing financial support , but should involve us , as an honest broker , making our contribution to bringing peace to the Middle East .
turning to trans @-@ Atlantic relations , I wish you , and of course the President of the Commission , great success with President Bush &apos;s visit , which will usher in a new era of good relations with the United States of America .
we cannot have two groups of states in the European Union , each with its own way of maintaining relations with the USA .
we Europeans must unite in taking up a position founded upon partnership with our American friends , and so , as you , Mr President of the Council , have said , we in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , bring determination and passion to supporting you , and wish you great success in your presidency .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the socialists are striving for a Europe of excellence .
for us , the Lisbon policy constitutes the best route towards European competitiveness , the basis of a good life , indeed a better life , for our citizens .
that is what is known as social cohesion .
the EU must stop complaining that Europe is said to be falling behind other regions of the world .
if Europe were no longer competitive , then how on earth could the Union account for the lion &apos;s share of world trade ?
in 2003 , for example , the Union accounted for 40 % of the trade in goods and 45 % of the trade in services throughout the world , more than the United States , Japan and China put together .
of course some of our industries are suffering from competition from countries in which salaries are low , but we will not make better products by dismantling our social model .
I should like to address the following remarks to some conservative and liberal Members of this House : protecting the right to work will provide workers with a sense of security and even well @-@ being .
in other words , this is an important factor in workers &quot; productivity , and , in turn , in companies &quot; competitiveness .
there is no conflict , but complementarity .
that is a quote from Mr Biltgen , the chairman of the Luxembourg Christian Social Party , an eminent member of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ...
President Juncker leads a coalition government of the Christian Social Party and the Socialists , which is a benchmark by which to reinvigorate the Union on the basis of broad political consensus .
the European Socialists have high hopes for this Luxembourg Presidency , primarily from the point of view of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy and of turning it into a genuine instrument of progress , particularly at the level of the 25 .
to this end , the macroeconomic framework must be redirected towards a policy of growth and stability .
stability is a public good that must be defended in the interests of our poorest citizens .
there will never be stability , however , without strong economic growth .
the Stability and Growth Pact must become an instrument that provides a means of both combating public deficit and fashioning an economic policy in tune with the economic cycles .
fiscal discipline is required in times of strong economic growth and more flexibility during periods of recession .
when it assesses each country &apos;s public finances , the Commission must also assess the quality of spending .
the practice of borrowing to finance running costs must be banned ; borrowing must be confined to investment to prepare for the future .
there cannot be more Europe with less money .
a Union of 455 million inhabitants cannot develop with a budget in 2005 limited to 1.004 % of Europe &apos;s GNP .
relaunching Lisbon , the &apos; intelligent &quot; Stability and Growth Pact , financial perspectives that actually offer new perspectives for Europe : these are the Herculean tasks facing the Luxembourg Presidency .
at the same time , we ask the Union not to forget the neglected people of the world .
if the international community is capable of offering debt relief to Iraq of some 80 % , and if it wishes to offer debt relief to those countries hit by the tsunami , it must also be capable of cancelling the debt that wipes out any development in developing world countries .
.
Mr President , this is the eleventh Luxembourg presidency .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , your presidency has high standards of its own to live up to and the high expectations of others to meet .
simultaneously President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council and of the Economic and Finance Council , you are in a unique position from which to reach agreement on one of your biggest and most delicate objectives - the financial perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
Liberals and Democrats are pleased to note that in your presidency programme you say that &apos; all progress towards European construction requires adequate financial resources &apos; .
we hope you will not be limited by dogmatic demands to cap the Union &apos;s budget at 1 % for the next decade .
we are not profligate with European citizens &apos; taxes and we insist that every euro be well spent and properly accounted for .
nonetheless , we , too , recognise that the European Union has justifiable ambitions , whether to run a coherent security strategy , generous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion .
these all have a cost , and we should not limit our political ambitions by penny @-@ pinching over what is , after all , a relatively modest budget .
I wish you every success in securing agreement in June , for I fear the approach of your successors in this , as in other matters , is unlikely to command a consensus .
my Group will call upon you to specify new arrangements for the Stability and Growth Pact , which underpins the single currency .
as &apos; Mr Euro &apos; , it is your right and duty to speak out for the euro and the euro zone .
if France and Germany are allowed to escape with a mild rebuke for exceeding the deficit limits for several consecutive years , if Greece is absolved from misrepresenting its true fiscal state to gain fast @-@ track entry to the euro , and if Italy continues to be reckless with its budget while harbouring a public debt of over 100 % , who will have confidence in those rules ?
the Stability Pact needs adjusting but it also needs enforcing , with proper monitoring arrangements like those used by the IMF .
we will look to you and your Council colleagues to be vigilant and true to your commitments .
your term in office will coincide with the mid @-@ term review of the much vaunted and little respected Lisbon Agenda .
it is in serious danger of stalling .
your commitment to a relaunch at this halfway mark will bear fruit if you succeed in completing the single market , in finding more funding for research and in promoting a favourable climate for entrepreneurship .
but do not try to be all things to all people .
structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon .
neither should you underestimate the challenge of enforcing existing directives .
your proposal to make national governments accountable to their peers , as well as to national parliaments and public opinion , is a good one and the Commission must be entrusted to monitor the measures needed and not be afraid to name and shame the laggards .
my Group also welcomes your commitment to move to the Community method in matters of justice and home affairs so important to our citizens .
we also share your ambitions for enlargement .
new arrivals are on the horizon . Bulgaria and Romania will shortly be joining us .
Croatia is a candidate country with which you must open negotiations .
let us be clear , as regards Croatia , that we expect General Gotovina to hand himself over or be turned over to The Hague to answer the case against him .
Croatia cannot duck that issue .
as Mr Poettering said , we cannot ignore the momentous events in Ukraine in the last two months .
as a collective body of institutions , we must encourage the opening @-@ up of that country and review bilateral relations in the light of new circumstances .
that is a task for your presidency .
in conclusion , as the Constitution enters its ratification phase , you may have three referenda on your watch , and you must do all in your power to make sure they succeed .
if political forces in Spain are allowed to raise the ghost of regional autonomy , if , in France , the debate is muddied by Turkish membership , if , in Britain , EU financing becomes an issue in the Constitutional Treaty debate , the whole thing will come crashing down around Europe &apos;s ears .
leave those issues where they belong and make sure Europe gets the Constitution it needs .
. - Mr President , today I have just discovered once again that Christian Democrat in one country does not mean the same thing as Christian Democrat in another country , I congratulate you ...
the same goes for the Greens , but at the moment , I am addressing the President of the Union and not the President of the European Greens .
that is the difference , Mr Poettering !
you said something very interesting .
if you are actually setting up a working group with Mr Barroso to look at the Lisbon process , I shall be very interested in taking part , in order to try and have everybody singing from the same hymn @-@ sheet .
in fact , we agree with you and disagree with Mr Barroso ; competitiveness must go hand in hand with sustainable growth , with social solidarity and environmental responsibility .
Mr Barroso forgot three of these four elements and this is why we need a working group between the Commission and the Council to have everybody singing from the same hymn @-@ sheet .
we are on your side , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
as regards the financial perspectives , everybody is once again in agreement .
paraphrasing Victor Hugo , I should like to tell you that letting stingy countries govern Europe is tantamount to letting a hurricane govern the ocean .
that is something we do not want .
it is apparent that when the hurricane governs the ocean , everything collapses .
if the stingy countries - by which I mean countries and governments that are very close to me - prevail with their 1 % , Europe will be the loser .
we are therefore on your side , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , in the fight against any attempts at reducing the European budget .
reducing the European budget is in fact tantamount to letting Europe collapse .
I should like to say one other thing - and this is very important - about education .
I refer to the debate initiated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development with the Programme for International Student Assessment .
when discussing education , it is important to have the courage to say what works and what does not work in the Member States .
it is not enough to speak of the need to educate , one must also say that there are education systems , teaching systems in Europe that are counter @-@ productive , reactionary and ideological .
to conclude , I should like to say that the tenth anniversary of the Dayton agreement and of Srebrenica falls during your Presidency .
I therefore ask Europe to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement , which might have been a necessary measure in its time , but which is unacceptable in view of the Constitution now in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
consequently , on the occasion of ten years since Srebrenica , I ask you , on Europe &apos;s behalf , to take steps to revise the Dayton agreement .
. Mr Juncker , I should first of all like to thank you for your introduction .
I would like to wish the Luxembourg Presidency success , and I wish it more wisdom than its Dutch predecessor had , although you have already made a little with your remark about the Constitution .
I urge you to give the public the opportunity to make up their own minds in a fair @-@ minded manner .
my first question to you is a short one .
it was six years ago that the euro was introduced .
at the time , in 1999 , European unemployment stood at 9 % , and has remained at that level to this day , while economic growth has slowed down .
my question to you is : do you not consider it high time we submitted the euro to a thorough overhaul , in which you , in fact , could take the lead ?
I regret the absence from your agenda of the continuation of the debate , initiated under the Dutch Presidency , on the control of animal diseases .
had this slipped your mind ?
according to your list of priorities , there are many misunderstandings surrounding the services directive .
exactly what kind of misunderstandings do you mean , and who , in your view , is labouring under them ?
is it the Commission , Parliament or the thousands of workers who have already voiced their disapproval of this services directive ?
from your wish to reassess the proposal in a more objective light , as you describe it , can I deduce that you share my view that the services directive is an extremely vague document that my fellow @-@ countryman , Commissioner Bolkestein , should never even have tabled ?
does the Luxembourg Presidency have concrete proposals for amending the Commission proposal on the services directive ?
if not , I would invite you to travel with me through the Netherlands .
you would be able to get to know those important public services , such as education and health care , that the directive puts in jeopardy .
I could also introduce you to those commercial service providers , including the coffee shop &apos; De Tevreden Roker &apos; &#91; The Satisfied Smoker &#93; and the &apos; Picobello Escort Service &apos; club , which would certainly be keen to become active in Luxembourg , or elsewhere for that matter .
to my mind , services of that kind are expressions of Dutch culture and thanks to the services directive , we will be able to inflict them on everyone .
you will gather that these last words were meant as a provocation , but I should like to ask you in all seriousness to take me up on my invitation .
we may then be able to have the desperately needed debate about the services directive , which seems to be absent in too many crucial places in Europe .
.
Mr President , Mr Juncker &apos;s speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise .
Mr Juncker , you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority , but your past statements serve to illustrate only the inconsistencies .
whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the pact &apos;s original rules , you recently said that the credibility of the pact had been buried and that the pact was dead .
is that still your opinion ?
you also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget , including the British rebate of some EUR 4 billion a year .
is that so , Mr Juncker ?
the rebate took to negotiate .
if your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June , then Mr Blair must have agreed in principle to surrender the rebate .
is that the case ?
with whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating ?
will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election , probably in May ?
finally , the UK Independence Party , and in particular my colleague Mr Farage , has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner .
more details will follow shortly and regularly .
are you to be tainted by association with them , or will you be expressing your concerns and the pressing need for change ?
. - Mr President , the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s programme is packed with crucial issues for the future of Europe , including the priorities on the economic front : the Lisbon strategy , reform of the Stability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 2013 .
my first point is that it will soon be time for the mid @-@ term review of the level of implementation of the Lisbon strategy .
to give it a greater chance of success , the programme needs to make the individual Member States responsible for achieving the targets that were set .
to that end , I consider the proposal to specify an individual at national level to be responsible for putting the strategy into practice to be a very useful idea .
secondly , with regard to the review of the Stability Pact , it has also been emphasised this morning that a reform is needed which can propose a more flexible interpretation of the Pact during times of recession , without bypassing the Maastricht criteria and without giving up the commitment to reduce the debt .
I am also convinced that steps could be taken to exclude certain specific types of investment from the calculation of the deficit in order to give a new boost to Europe &apos;s growth and competitiveness .
thirdly , I hope that we can really succeed in approving the financial perspective up to 2013 by June , so that the resources can be used to the full from the very beginning of the period in question .
I especially hope that the proposals - the Council &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s proposals on those important topics - are adequately discussed in advance by Parliament which , let us recall , is the only European institution that directly represents the sovereignty of the people .
lastly , I hope that a European civil protection agency will at last be set up during the Luxembourg Presidency so that natural disasters can be dealt with in an appropriate manner , with particular emphasis on prevention .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , there are many in this House who have , for some time , been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now , and I am one of them .
the work programme you have presented is enormous , but you also have a reputation for working wonders , and it is to the wonder @-@ worker in you that I would like to appeal , asking you also to give attention to the Members &quot; statute .
we urgently need a fair and credible statute of this kind .
somewhere between your country and mine is to be found not only the problem , but also the solution to it .
we are told that the German Government does not want one before the next elections , but , at the same time , the German model - as regards Members &quot; remuneration rather than additional earnings and lobbyists - could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind .
we have to put a stop to the unworthy greed in this place .
this House must cease to be a parliament of the insatiable , or else serious damage will be done to democracy , which is what this place is all about .
if the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council does not wish to reply to the very specific and precise questions that have just been put to him , we shall continue with the debate .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , Luxembourg &apos;s Presidency of the Council in this first half of 2005 is very probably the last of its kind that we shall see .
under the European Constitution , by the time my country is next in line to take its turn in the presidency , the presidency of the Council of Heads of State or Government will have been permanently reformed .
it follows that a last presidency - which is what this one is - must be a good one , and one whose successes will stand the test of time .
the biggest and most difficult tasks for our 2005 presidency have to do with finance policy ; its agenda is dominated by the determination of the financial framework for the period from 2007 to 2013 and by a more flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact .
the financial framework for the enlarged Union must be negotiated in such a way that an ambitious approach to the shaping of European policy is not obstructed by budgetary constraints at national level .
Europe &apos;s 450 million inhabitants expect the European Union to be able to take effective action , and we will not be meeting their expectations by disputing over tenths and hundredths of percentage points , so it is vital that the Luxembourg Presidency should make a success of the tricky feat of giving the EU &apos;s financial planning a European dimension .
in so doing , it will be acting in the interests of every European and of a Union that is not only enlarging itself but also , and at the same time , benefiting its citizens by putting its policies on an adequate and appropriate financial footing , failing which further rounds of enlargement will be quite beyond its capacities .
during the coming six months , Europe &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact is to be reinterpreted in line with the economic situation .
it is in fact economic good sense , as well as the demands of a dynamic employment policy in Europe , that require that it be adapted to take account of the realities of the growth cycle .
the fact is that the Pact is about growth as well as stability , and excessive rigidity must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than promote it .
the Lisbon strategy faces its mid @-@ term review on 22 March of this year , when what has been achieved so far will be assessed and new priorities set .
the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council proposes that , by 2010 , every Member State should have set in motion tangible and demonstrable reforms in every one of the areas in which the Lisbon strategy requires action .
that having been said , the EU &apos;s economic environment will also undergo changes over the next five years .
Europe is not alone in the world in striving to improve its performance and become more competitive , and so the Lisbon reform agenda will have to be successfully implemented by 2010 .
the Luxembourg Presidency is well aware of that , and will endeavour to ensure that its announcement is followed up by a stage in which progress is actually made .
finally , it matters a great deal to me that something should be said , in this debate , on the epoch @-@ making events in Ukraine , which is a European state , one that has , in the last month , demonstrated its desire to be one of us , and its ability to enrich the European family with its convictions and its experience .
if it should be under Luxembourg &apos;s Presidency that a start is made on completing the map of Europe , we should bear in mind that Slovakia , Poland , Hungary and Romania have a neighbour whose people see their future as being alongside all of us in Europe .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , let me just start with a brief comment .
I see the statute as too important an issue to be a plaything for demagogues , and so I would ask you to ignore the rabble @-@ rousing utterances that have been made and go ahead with what you plan to do with all your strength and in earnest , addressing this issue and finding a solution to it .
your speech , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , was a very good one , and I would like to congratulate you on getting the right balance between the economy and society and particularly on giving priority to employment and growth .
if I may be frank , that is an example to many , and not just to Christian Democrat Heads of Government .
I would , though , also like to endorse what you said about the foreign policy aspects .
two countries in our vicinity - Ukraine and Palestine - have held important elections in recent weeks .
in both instances , the European Union played a very active part in bringing about change through democratic , open and transparent elections , and Europe must , as you said , hang on in there .
we must not disappoint the people whom we have , to some degree , motivated to summon up the courage to bring about changes , and whom we have helped to do so in a transparent manner .
do not let yourself be discouraged , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , for you are quite right to say that the development we are promoting and supporting in Ukraine is not a development in opposition to Russia , but we must nevertheless try to work together with Russia towards finding solutions .
Ukraine must not become the ball in a game of power politics played by the European Union and Russia .
Russia must of course acknowledge that there have been changes that it may find disagreeable , but which the people themselves have chosen .
were these changes now to be pursued to some degree in opposition to Russia , it would not be in Ukraine &apos;s interests , for it is too varied and too diversified , and we know that it is those parts that are to some extent aligned with Russia that are Ukraine &apos;s economic powerhouses .
similarly , in Palestine , we need to remain involved and to continue giving political moral and financial support , as we have done for years , whilst always taking a critical line when it could not be clearly shown where the money was flowing .
we have brought about many changes and introduced a degree of transparency , including in the way Palestine is administered .
that is what we have achieved , and we will continue to do so if we get stuck in and , as has been said , do not limit ourselves to supplying funds but also help the Palestinian people to gain a state of their own .
the only way to guarantee security in the Middle East is for there to be both an Israel that is secure within its own borders and also a new Palestinian state .
even if foreign policy is not one of your presidency &apos;s priorities from the word go , we cannot desert the people whom we have helped to bring about change ; it is also in our own interest , in the interests of stability and our own continent , that we should help them towards the real political goal .
Mr President , I welcome the presidency and congratulate it on its priorities .
I have four questions .
the EU faces very considerable challenges during the next six months .
naturally , the half @-@ term reviewof theLisbon process is one of the overriding issues .
it is time for European leaders to begin to act .
I much appreciate the presidency &apos;s statement that economic growth is important but that the other two pillars of stability are also needed , namely social and environmental development .
what , nonetheless , needs to be explained is not merely the fact that you intend to improve the Lisbon process , but the way in which you intend to do this .
the other issue concerns the energy area .
a better environment and improved self @-@ sufficiency are naturally very important and bring about economic growth .
the production of biomass creates jobs in districts and regions with low economic growth and can contribute to a better environment and to more stable energy production .
how do you intend to combine the half @-@ term reform of agricultural policy with energy policy and industrial policy ?
mark Twain once said that &apos; All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence , and then success is sure . &quot;
obviously , that is not the case .
research policy needs to be strengthened , and we need a knowledge @-@ based economy .
what will the presidency do to ensure faster achievement of the 3 % target where grants for research are concerned ?
finally , the fourth area .
nothing was mentioned about what is perhaps the most important legislative process under way , namely the Chemicals Directive , REACH .
we have the opportunity to create a global standard if we combine the Commission &apos;s proposal with better workability .
uncertainty is very expensive both for industry and the environment .
how do you intend to work with REACH ?
finally , I should like to congratulate you on a very good presentation of the priorities and hope that , during the next six months , you will be able to achieve the objectives you have established .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I am delighted at the clear and courageous statements that have been made by the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to sustainable development policy .
the Luxembourg Presidency , to a greater extent than its predecessors , is attempting to maintain a balance between economic , social and environmental policies .
it is calling for something quite simple , namely that social and environmental policies be a starting point and not an end goal as far as growth policy is concerned .
I hope that this will be the line followed by the Luxembourg Presidency at the European Council and within the respective sectoral Councils , and I am sure that your proposals on the main areas of work , namely the Financial Perspectives , the reform of the Stability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process , will be guided by this spirit of sustainable development .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I also hope that you will find the energy to convince the European Council that Europe should continue to act as the driving force behind the Kyoto process .
after the European Union &apos;s success with Kyoto , it is essential that it now set out a long @-@ term framework for climate change policy , with objectives for the period 2020 @-@ 2050 .
this is what both our citizens and our economic players expect .
what guidelines will economic players in Europe follow when investing in key sectors such as energy and transport , if we have not laid down a clear framework for future policies in this field ?
turning to the Lisbon strategy , you noted that it related to three areas , namely environmental , social and economic issues .
it is the ambitious environmental policies of recent decades that have made Europe a global leader in environmental technologies and renewable energies .
I hope that you will revise Chapter V of the Koch report to ensure that the European economy can benefit from these ambitious policies .
the Lisbon agenda should also include an ambitious social policy .
the Commission is pressing for extensive liberalisation , in particular as proposed in the Bolkenstein directive , and I am glad that you have expressed criticism of this directive , Mr Juncker .
I hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will also take advantage of criticisms from within the Competitiveness Council to hold a debate on this directive , and , if necessary , to check its progress , as well as to force the Commission to table a directive on services of general interest .
I believe that confusion will reign over the Bolkenstein directive until the issue of services of general interest has been clarified .
I very much welcome the fact that this presidency aims to harmonise social , environmental and economic policies , as this is good news for Europe .
- Mr President , the tsunami tragedy should be no less significant to the world &apos;s leaders and to Europe than 11 September .
the Asian tsunami should act as a turning point for the most pressing of the world &apos;s priorities - that of preventing and combating hunger and disease .
I therefore wish to ask four questions .
firstly , do you believe that the EUR 450 million announced for reconstruction might undermine programmes already planned for Asia ( as is the case of EUR 150 million of the EUR 450 million announced ) ?
secondly , do you intend to back the cancellation of the debt of countries affected by the tsunami or do you advocate just a moratorium ?
thirdly , will they be treated the same as Iraq , or worse than Iraq ?
lastly , Commissioner Michel proposed to the last Council a more ambitious target than 0.7 % for development .
will you reconsider this proposal , or will it be jettisoned for good ?
my dear Mr Juncker , Luxembourg &apos;s presidencies of the EU are usually among the best , perhaps because a small country knows that it cannot monopolise the agenda but that it must be of service to everyone .
I am sure that you will continue that tradition , and would also call upon you and the Council to treat supporters and opponents of the Constitution exactly the same .
our buildings here are full of expressions of commitment to a &apos; yes &quot; vote : &apos; yes &quot; signs , badges and balloons , their presence decided upon - and paid for out of our common budget - before Parliament has voted .
it will not , however , be until this afternoon that we know the result , and it is certain that there will be votes both in favour of , and against , the Constitution .
those in favour cannot steal taxpayers &quot; contributions to promote a definite view .
referendums belong to us all , and voters are entitled to balanced information , not propaganda paid for through taxes .
on Monday evening , Parliament &apos;s Sessional Services decided to send some millions of euros to the supranational EU parties , which are all in favour of the EU Constitution .
more than 150 Members of the European Parliament will not have a share of these resources .
that is contrary to the principle of equality and thus illegal .
I would call upon you to raise the matter in the Council so that the regulation relating to parties is either abolished or supplemented by arrangements for those who do not wish to belong to a supranational party but wish to engage in corresponding European information @-@ providing activities , for example concerning the Constitution .
how will you guarantee that EU resources used by the campaigners for a &apos; yes &quot; vote can be used equally well by the campaigners for a &apos; no &quot; vote ?
may I finally call upon you to intimate that you will respect the outcome of the referendums , whether they be &apos; yes &quot; or &apos; no . &quot;
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there can be no doubt that the most ambitious task facing the incoming Luxembourg Presidency will be the conclusion of negotiations on the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
this will unquestionably be an extremely challenging task , but I am in no doubt that everything in our power should be done to reach a compromise on the budget by June of this year at the latest .
otherwise we will risk major delays , for example in the drawing up of regional aid programmes , and this could mean EU funds not reaching the Member States in January 2007 .
it is of course not just the date by which we reach a compromise that is of crucial importance , but also the nature of the compromise .
Mr Barroso rightly said that we cannot have more Europe for less money .
the European Union will cease to exist without solidarity , and this is why we cannot consent to either the policy of solidarity or the need to support the new Member States being removed from the EU &apos;s budget priorities .
we must be aware that unless gaps in economic development within the enlarged EU are addressed , it will be impossible to achieve the goals of the Lisbon strategy .
we must therefore ensure that funds are earmarked in the future EU budget for cohesion policy , as this is in the interests of the whole Community .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , there can be no doubt that President Bush &apos;s visit to Brussels will be the most significant event to occur during the six @-@ month Luxembourg Presidency .
it will be the first time that a President of the United States has ever visited the European institutions .
I hope that this symbolic visit will go some way to improving transatlantic relations , which have been somewhat strained recently .
unless we cooperate closely with the United States , we will struggle to respond to a great many global challenges .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I welcomed your comments on relations with Ukraine .
the European Union must draw its own conclusions from events last year in one of its neighbouring countries .
the Ukrainian people have proven that they share our European values , and that they desire integration with the EU .
we should therefore offer them a partnership that could ultimately lead to membership .
Mr President , as you know , the European institutions recently - and , I think , disastrously - cut the Gordian knot with regard to the possible accession of a non @-@ European country , Turkey , to the European Union .
an issue of that kind threatens to change the very nature of the Union as we know it and even puts the future of European cooperation as we know it fundamentally at risk .
it is , above all , an issue in respect of which a large majority of our electorate , our citizens , are very alienated from the position adopted by the official European institutions .
I regret , then , the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s failure to take the opportunity , first of all , of asking respect for the democratic will of the majority of our citizens and , secondly , as a small Member State , asking respect for that other small Member State , Cyprus , which is being ignored and misjudged by the Turkish leaders in the most arrogant and unacceptable manner .
in my view , this is a missed opportunity , and one that can only widen the enormous chasm between our citizens on the one hand and European politics on the other .
Mr Juncker has described a very ambitious agenda for these next six months ; this agenda offers a great opportunity , but is also a great responsibility for Luxembourg and particularly for its Prime Minister , who has both experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task .
I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency , which , in my opinion , will be the reform of the financial perspectives , which you , Mr Juncker , mentioned in passing .
it will probably be the most essential element , on the basis of which these six months will be assessed .
it is clear that success or failure depends not only upon the actions of the Presidency , but it is the case that during this time the Luxembourg Government will have to employ all its determination , and I am pleased that you have stated this morning that you will ensure that the general interest is put first , because , as you have said yourself , to reach July without an agreement would spell financial chaos for the European Union .
in order to be successful , the Presidency will have to seek compromises ; I believe that these compromises will have to be based on two fundamentals : on the one hand , the validity of the principle of cohesion , as stated by the Council at the end of the Swedish Presidency , and , on the other , balance in the distribution of burdens .
I hope that over the next six months this House can learn the cost of enlargement to the original fifteen Member States , because on the objective basis of figures it is possible to make proposals that the European citizens in each Member State can understand and accept .
on the subject of the citizens , and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties , I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament , which is going to give its opinion in May , to play in this negotiation ?
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , you recently stated , Mr Juncker , and indeed you repeated just now , that competitiveness will be neither the Holy Grail nor the be all and end all as far as you are concerned , in particular with regard to the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon strategy .
you noted that social goals and sustainable development goals should not be placed in opposition to goals relating to competitiveness .
my group welcomes this statement , as we believe the opposite to be true , namely that promotion of the European model is a major driving force behind competitiveness on our continent .
in fact , we believe that what is needed is a Europe of excellence which attaches priority to investment in research , innovation , employee training , the quality of infrastructures , trans @-@ European networks , public services , the quality of work and social relations .
we agree with you on this issue , and we sometimes detected a slight difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission .
we hope that he will be equally clear in his statements , especially with regard to social issues .
yet the good intentions you have professed to hold will be put to a number of tests .
I should like to mention three such tests , the first of which is the European budget .
we share your view that this debate must not be allowed to get bogged down and that it must progress rapidly .
you intend to act as a motivating and intermediary force , as well as one that accelerates the process , but we do not want the process of reaching a compromise on the Financial Perspectives to be accelerated if this would mean sacrificing a budget that meets the European Union &apos;s needs .
we agree with Mr Barroso on this issue ; we need a budget that enables us to guarantee cohesion , solidarity , investment in the future and in research and investment in the trans @-@ European networks .
the process should not be accelerated at the expense of the final outcome .
the second test will be the directive on services of general interest , which has already been mentioned today by a number of speakers , in particular Mr Turmes .
I believe that you yourself are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us , namely the extended scope of this directive , which poses a threat to a large number of services of general interest .
we are also concerned by the country of origin principle , which poses a threat to the right to work in multiple countries ; I am thinking in particular of the application of collective bargaining agreements .
the third test relates more generally to the European social agenda .
we would particularly like to see a clear commitment on your part in relation to other Council members regarding a review of the Directive on Working Time and a removal of the opt @-@ out clause , and , finally , regarding a proposed review of the Directive on European Works Councils .
Mr President , on 1 January , Luxembourg began its eleventh EU presidency .
the experience it has gained in this field , and the excellent preparations that have been made and which I have seen for myself , will be a great help in dealing with the various challenges that await you , starting with the terrible disaster in Asia .
the latter showed that there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid to be coordinated on the ground , and should encourage us to set up the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps , as provided for by the Constitution , as soon as possible .
there are other issues that you will have to deal with , of which I shall only mention three .
firstly , the Lisbon process has reached its halfway point .
this process needs to be made clearer and it needs targeted priorities ; in short , it will need to be made easier to understand .
I am therefore fully in favour of the three aims you identified .
the second issue will be the Financial Perspective .
it is doubtless to be welcomed that it will be the Luxembourg Presidency that puts the finishing touches to it , but many people are still undecided between 1 % and 1.24 % , to say nothing of 1.14 % - and I could go on - and much money is also hanging in the balance .
finally , the Stability Pact will need to be amended , and the necessary balance found between strictness and flexibility to ensure that stability is not compromised .
Mr President , I very much hope that your success will be equal to the efforts that have been made by so many people .
Mr President , I would like to wish Prime Minister Juncker a positive and productive presidency and am very pleased to see a small , successful , independent country leading the European Union .
Luxembourg is one of the six Member States that is smaller than my own country , Wales , and an example of what an independent Wales could achieve .
the priorities paper tries to maintain the essential balance between economic , social and environmental policies .
I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination , in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gender Institute and on the recast equality directive .
there is no better example of the failure of policies on equality than the pay gap between men and women .
thirty years after legislation was passed on this issue , a report published this week by the GMB trade union in the UK shows that , in Anglesey in my constituency , full @-@ time pay for women is as low as 59 % of that for men .
this is a scandal which must be addressed and I hope equality issues will be given priority .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to express my condolences to Mr Juncker on account of the death of Grand Duchess Josephine @-@ Charlotte .
I wish you and the Luxembourg people strength to bear this loss , and may God be close to you .
the Luxembourg Presidency is facing the weighty task of reforming the Stability Pact and implementing the conclusions of Wim Kok &apos;s report .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to give due consideration to the economic climate in the Stability Pact offers , in my view , a basis for carrying out adequate reforms .
the implementation of the Pact benefits from clear decision @-@ making .
clear sanctions are still needed .
it was in the autumn of 2004 that Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy ; his conclusion is as clear as it is predictable : the Member States must really get down to carrying out structural reforms .
I would therefore like to ask Mr Juncker in what way we can expect your presidency to follow that up .
since Luxembourg has always been a great champion of necessary reforms , I have high hopes .
finally , with regard to the Members &quot; statute , can Parliament expect from the presidency that a decision will finally be made on this subject in the next six months ?
thank you , Mr President .
I wish the Luxembourg presidency every success . it will be in the interests of us all .
you are the second country to hold the presidency of the enlarged twenty @-@ five .
you are a founding state of the European Union and you are also an example of how a small country can set the tempo and dictate the conditions to the big countries .
the President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , drew attention in his speech today to the increased financial pressure on the new Member States , referring to the backward regions .
I should like to point out that these ten Member States also have great wealth .
many of these regions have been deprived of tens and hundreds of young ambitious people , scientists , doctors , who have left in the last fifteen years for the old Europe and they are contributing to their successful economies .
I should like to point out to the Luxembourg presidency that we do not wish to be just the recipients of charity .
I see this as an opportunity for you actively to involve the new ten .
following ratification of the Constitutional Treaty , Europe will build new institutions .
I invite you to take steps to ensure that the east of the European Union is given the right to host an important European institution .
I am convinced that this idea could be a success .
evidence of this faith is the fact that the Bush - Putin meeting is to take place in my little country , Slovakia .
- Mr President , the reform of the Stability Pact and the reform of the financial perspective are two sides of the same coin .
these reforms need to find a common philosophy and a common solution : more growth , more competitiveness and more resources for the Member States .
that all means more affluence and more cohesion .
let me be frank with you , Mr Juncker .
what you have said on the Stability and Growth Pact is thoroughly acceptable , but it is all provided for in the current system of regulation : the automatic stabilising mechanisms , their relationship with growth or recession , the relationship between greater deficit flexibility and the effectiveness of debt dynamics - all that is already provided for .
what the European Union needs now is not that , but perhaps we should be more ambitious .
I say more ambitious , but that does not mean less rigorous , just more mindful of the strategic needs of our Union .
if we really have to re @-@ establish an effective , Europe @-@ wide strategy for investments , infrastructure , research and security - in short , to meet the targets set at the Lisbon Summit - then we have to reach agreement on the kinds of action needed : no hypocrisy , no dirty tricks and no opportunism .
the Pact needs a European golden rule , as one might say , with the appropriate guarantees and controls attached .
the financial perspective needs a stronger , not a weaker Union budget , one that focuses more on the investments required by the Lisbon objectives and less on handouts .
Mr Juncker , Mr Barroso , will we be capable of that ?
it depends on us .
the responsibility rests with us all , but please let us not have any hypocrisy .
Mr Juncker , I would like to focus my brief comments on the financial perspectives , which , of the challenges that have been mentioned today , are perhaps the most difficult facing this Presidency .
in explaining your priorities , you say that you accept the reasons why it is necessary to reach a political agreement on the financial perspectives in June , so that the legislative procedures can be concluded under the British Presidency , reconciling national differences .
we wish you luck , because , on the one hand , there is the enlargement we have just carried out , with ten new Member States whose economic situation mean that we are going to have to make an enormous financial effort with a view to social and economic cohesion , in order to protect the European social model , as you have stressed in your speech .
on the other hand , there are the short @-@ sighted accountants , whose sole aim is not to exceed a certain level of spending .
we hope that , with your experience and with the cooperation of the European Parliament , your Presidency will persuade the Council to take a broader view , and make it see that it is irresponsible to try to create more Europe with less resources - to use once again that well @-@ worn phrase .
but it is also necessary to make the Council see that budgetary policy , Mr Juncker , is facing much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product .
let us continue to build a Europe amongst all of us and with sufficient resources , as laid down in the Treaties , so that we do not disappoint the citizens .
Mr President , the new presidency can be assured that hundreds and thousands of British citizens will fight the proposed European Constitution tooth and nail , and millions of us will vote against it when the time comes !
we have no quarrel with the people of Europe : our quarrel is only with the system of unitary government called the European Union .
the EU is the of the accountable parliamentary democracy that the British invented over 700 years ago .
this attempted reversal of the relationship between the State and the individual has been foisted on us over the last 30 years by deceit , denial and misrepresentation .
but now we understand fully what the EU is really all about .
we may not leave during your presidency , but be in no doubt - leave we shall !
Mr President , the tenor of my speech will be rather different from that of the previous speaker &apos;s .
let me start by thanking the Luxembourg Presidency , not only for the excellent agenda it has presented , but also for the style , content and level of commitment evident in it .
in the coming months , the Luxembourg Presidency will certainly have its work cut out , and we have high hopes .
there are great challenges that require an answer and that Europe has to meet .
I should like to bring up one of those challenges , namely more and better jobs , but also sustainability and social cohesion .
I will therefore repeat to Mr Goebbels and Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit that the Socialists and the Greens do not have sole exhibition rights in this respect .
social cohesion is very much one of the Christian Democrats &quot; principles , and I will always continue to dedicate myself , as I know will our group , to ensure that social cohesion is maintained .
that is why I am pleased that not only the President of the Council , but also the President of the Commission and the chairman of my group mentioned it .
I should like to say a few words about Lisbon , and I want to make a number of points .
first of all , while the objective of what we did in Lisbon was sound , and the result we would like to achieve is excellent , we forgot that , when all those Heads of Government went home , nobody assumed any responsibility or liability for this process .
what matters more than anything else at the moment is , in addition to all the new measures that have to be taken , for people to be made accountable .
it will then be possible to verify national plans at European level .
I should like to finish off with a cry from the heart .
I have noticed that we have made a few agreements about the free market that were subsequently flouted by the Member States and also by the European Commission , as regards qualifications , mobility , and so on .
Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy is so full of grand ideas that we often hear very little - and indeed we have heard very little today - about the simple things , such as improving the quality of our own legislation .
the fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its productivity if its regulatory framework was matched by the best in the world .
we should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxembourg presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consultations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate .
we also need to spend time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for .
often we pass legislation , but do not look at what it has actually achieved .
is existing legislation being properly enforced and implemented ?
it seems to me that , in the European Union of 25 , implementation enforcement should get far higher priority than it has up until now .
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has taken up my suggestion that we should have an own @-@ initiative report looking precisely at these issues .
we have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe , but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to everybody and not simply to those who are in work .
far too many of our citizens are economically inactive , and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work .
if we fail to do that , then we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy .
finally , I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take fresh initiatives in relation to Northern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic regeneration in that part of the country .
Mr President , I should like to begin by wishing Mr Juncker and his country a successful presidency .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , you assume the leadership of the Union at a crucial period .
the ratification process for the Constitution is underway , the Lisbon process is not yet making enough progress and the future of transatlantic relations is a source of concern .
in March , the European Council will conduct the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon process .
it will do it against the backdrop of the Kok report , which was blunt in its assessment of the lack of progress .
I urge the presidency not to be distracted by the siren calls of those who urge that the preservation of the &apos; European model &apos; is the most important political priority .
it is clearly not . it is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in such dire straits .
the United States continues to out @-@ perform us and the competitive challenges from Asia , particularly China and India , are increasing , with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in our Union .
the presidency must be unequivocal in its support for economic reform , for greater labour market flexibility , for more competitive taxation policies , and for reducing barriers to employment growth , particularly the excessive regulation that pervades all our economies .
with high unemployment a factor across Europe , people are waiting for practical ways of getting them back to work .
reform will be difficult and fraught with risk , but as the United Kingdom , under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and Spain under Mr Aznar in the 1990s proved , a resolute approach to economic reform delivers results .
low taxation , flexible labour markets , less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth @-@ creators offers the only way out of a relative economic decline .
these things are naturally anathema to socialists but are good for all our citizens .
we look to the spring Council in March to reverse the failures of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterprise @-@ driven path .
Mr President , the whole issue of children has been invisible in EU policies and programmes .
however , children &apos;s rights are now mentioned in the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
it is important that progress is made towards a horizontal European policy on children .
children cannot defend themselves . thus it is our obligation to do this .
every day we hear about children who are starving , dying or abused in all possible ways .
however , there is no mention in your programme of a full @-@ scale strategy on children &apos;s rights in accordance with the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , which was ratified by most European countries .
children are vulnerable to trafficking .
the recently published report on trafficking in human beings by the Experts Group has a strong human rights dimension .
I urge the Luxembourg presidency to take this forward , including a specific legal instrument to promote and protect the rights of children who have been trafficked .
the Luxembourg presidency has stated that a directive on the return of asylum seekers is a priority .
it is important that there is a specific section to protect the rights of children and that unaccompanied children are not returned to their countries of origin without an assessment of what is in their best interests .
the mainstreaming of children &apos;s rights in European Union development policy has not been achieved .
I urge the Luxembourg presidency to address this failure without delay by calling for a communication on children &apos;s rights and new development cooperation and by supporting references to children &apos;s rights as a priority .
I further urge it to revise the development policy statement .
the implementation of new guidelines to safeguard children in conflict areas remains a concern .
in order to ensure progress , it is essential that the Luxembourg presidency takes this process forward by completing and putting into practice a plan of action .
in conclusion , it is vital that children &apos;s rights are made a priority of the Luxembourg presidency and that children &apos;s rights are included in the presidency conclusions .
Mr President , I have noticed two shortcomings in the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s programme , and I should like to ask two questions with regard to these shortcomings .
the document outlining the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s priorities mentions 27 countries and regions outside the EU by name , yet Eastern Europe and Ukraine are not mentioned once .
to put it another way , the programme lacks an eastern dimension .
it would be somewhat alarming if this reflected the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;s views and intentions with regard to the new European democracy that has emerged before our very eyes and on our very doorstep .
the comments made before this House on Ukraine have been very cautious .
they do not imply that measures will be taken that are equal to the responsibility which Europe bears towards Ukraine , and which poses a moral and political imperative .
if we were to content ourselves with the old Action Plan , which was based on the neighbourhood policy , we would be doing far too little , and we would be making a mistake .
this plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age , before the &apos; Orange Revolution &quot; took place , offering hope and a model for peaceful political transformation .
the events in Ukraine merit a reaction from Europe , not merely words and outdated instruments .
time passes more rapidly , and indeed differently , in Central and Eastern Europe .
we must act now to ensure that democracy is not merely victorious , but that it is long @-@ lasting and a source of hope to others .
what should therefore be done ?
the old Action Plan should be revised and extended beyond the neighbourhood policy , and a fresh offer should be made .
the EU &apos;s relations with Ukraine should be advanced to a new level , and the country should be offered an Association Agreement and the prospect of membership .
we should not thwart Ukraine &apos;s European hopes or trade in our fundamental values , such as freedom , democracy and solidarity , for oil and gas .
by supporting Ukrainian democracy we will also support the democratic ambitions of the citizens of Belarus , Russia and the other countries of the post @-@ Soviet space .
it is an opportunity for political change that will benefit the European Union in every respect .
the era of Yalta , of the Brezhnev Doctrine and of the Berlin Wall has ended .
we need a courageous policy based on our values , not on our financial interests , and promoting democracy , human rights and the right of nations to self @-@ determination .
the forging of more open relations with a democratic Ukraine is both a great challenge and a great responsibility for the Luxembourg Presidency .
I wish it every success .
. Mr President , I can take one of two approaches ; I can either answer the 30 Members who have spoken , and risk being very long @-@ winded , or I can merely answer a few of them , and risk appearing extremely impolite to the others .
I shall therefore try to be brief in order to be polite .
Mr Goebbels , who has been following my progress closely for many years , believes me to be entirely incapable of such a thing , and on this point we agree .
Mr President , several speakers have referred to the Lisbon agenda , in particular the group chairmen and other Members such as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Oomen .
it would appear that we are more or less in agreement on the need to maintain the fundamental synergy on which the Lisbon strategy is based , and which was given a useful boost by the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council .
it has become a habit of Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit &apos;s to refer indiscriminately to authors from both sides of the Rhine , and today he quoted Victor Hugo .
with regard to the Lisbon agenda , I should like to quote Pascal , who said that he liked things that go hand in hand .
this holds true for a number of areas of life , and it also holds true for the Lisbon strategy .
it is impossible to distinguish between the various elements that go towards making the Lisbon strategy so effective - and I am talking here of its theoretical effectiveness , not the enthusiasm with which it is implemented .
a number of you have referred to the much @-@ needed structural reforms that must be carried out in the framework of the Lisbon strategy .
I have been a member of the Ecofin Council since 1989 , I believe .
since then , I have been told week after week and month after month that structural reforms must be carried out , yet it is rare for me to come across anyone who is able to say exactly what these structural reforms should look like .
as a general rule , it is my impression that those who say that structural reforms must be carried out actually mean that the social state must be dismantled .
this is why it is frequently said with regard to structural reforms that labour markets must be reformed and that they need to be more flexible .
I believe this to be true , but I also believe that European employers could be more flexible .
I believe that it would be in the interests of decision @-@ makers , who frequently also take decisions for others , to prove themselves more flexible in adapting the tools we have to modern needs .
I myself do not believe that Europeans should be led to think that it will be enough to reform labour markets , to abolish existing social legislation and to eliminate the buffer zones provided by workers &quot; rights in order to become more competitive .
this would be a very short @-@ term approach , with obvious consequences ; we would not gain competitiveness , but we would lose the support of a large number of Europeans , in particular workers .
I should therefore like to warn you against such simplistic proposals , which will get us nowhere .
several of you stated that your groups would support the Stability Pact , and this made the debate extremely interesting .
I shall explain what I mean by this .
Mr Goebbels , no less , offered the support of his parliamentary group , the Socialists .
if I understood him correctly , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit appears to be moving towards a clear meeting of interests and ideas on this issue .
Mr Poettering promised the support of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party .
five minutes of the Luxembourg Presidency were therefore all that were needed to see the Socialists , the Liberals , the Christian Democrats and all the others agree on the general shape to be taken by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact .
this is something I welcome greatly , and in this respect the Luxembourg Presidency will be straightforward ; this was not something I was aware of before today &apos;s sitting .
I shall turn briefly to the Directive on the liberalisation of services , with regard to which I thought I had made my views clear .
we will not reject this Directive , as it could in fact generate jobs if we draft it in a way that is appropriate to the situation .
I would like us , however , to join forces to remove everything from this Directive which poses a risk of social dumping , and which has crept into the text if one reads between the lines .
I am well aware that our discussion of this directive is bedevilled by confusion , because the potential risks posed by a number of its provisions are not obvious .
I should therefore like to call on the Commission , the Council and Parliament to examine this draft directive line by line , searching for any risk of social dumping .
after all , given that everyone , including Mr Bolkestein , tells me that the aim is not to violate the rules which protect our labour markets , we should be able to eliminate the risk of social dumping - a risk I believe to be very much present as far as this directive is concerned - by means of a common reading , if this is indeed our overall intention .
