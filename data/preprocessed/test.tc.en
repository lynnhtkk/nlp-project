possible aids could be national Lisbon plans , a number of structural indicators , involving national parliaments in monitoring and assessing the process and certainly also a classification of the Member States according to performance .
in addition , we would also urge you to ensure that the essence of the Stability and Growth Pact remains intact .
that is something about which a number of Members have had a lot to say .
finally , we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in services , but in the right way , that is , with the support of the public and of civil society .
we are also expecting proposals aimed at improving the investment climate , including for the medium @-@ sized and small enterprises that are still the driving force of our economic growth .
we all know that without any growth , there are no jobs , and without any jobs , there is no basis for social security , which we are all very keen to see protected .
Mr President , you have an arduous task , all the more so because the Constitution has not yet been approved and the financial perspectives are as yet unknown .
we are , in fact , asking you to serve up a menu without having a kitchen to prepare it and without knowing what budget is available .
however , we are counting on your creativity and on a good team spirit among your people .
if , in January , you propose solid policy and dish up a consistent meal , you will have a lasting ally in the PPE @-@ DE Group .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened to each and every one of you most attentively .
I thank you for your contributions , which reflect a wide variety of views in this Parliament .
I also eagerly await the result of your vote next Thursday .
the resolution that is then adopted will certainly be very important for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union .
at this time I think I might already draw three provisional conclusions .
first , I note that the great majority of speakers agree with the need to define priorities that correspond to the public &apos;s expectations and think it important that the European Union and its institutions should respond to the primary concerns of European citizens .
secondly , the great majority of speakers identified three basic areas for action : the area we can call Lisbon , the Lisbon strategy ( economic reform with a social and environmental dimension ) ; the areas connected with security and justice ; and Europe &apos;s role in the world .
thirdly , I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a proactive cohesion policy , a true solidarity policy in Europe .
I particularly hope that the Member States &quot; Governments have taken careful note of this .
accordingly , I feel that we can conclude that there is consensus regarding Europe &apos;s need for growth and employment .
without growth , without job creation and without greater dynamism in our economy , we shall be unable to maintain the high levels of social protection and the exacting environmental standards that we regard as part of what is normally called the European model .
what is at stake is not , and never has been , the destruction of the European model .
what is truly at stake is the need to adapt and to modernise this European model , and to take account of a number of new challenges that are now making themselves felt across Europe and the world .
the increasing age of our population , the effects of globalisation - all this requires Europe to adapt and change within this more competitive context .
I am pleased to say that I do not believe that concerns for economic efficiency and concerns for social justice are mutually incompatible .
these objectives - greater competitiveness alongside sustainable development and social concern - cannot in any way be incompatible .
we have to work to make them compatible .
these are objectives that define one of our priorities .
I therefore believe we must work towards achieving the broadest possible consensus , but a dynamic consensus and one that is not the result of cancelling out opposing points of view , because we also have to recognise that there are some contradictory priorities here in Parliament .
accordingly , we have to identify the highest common denominator for a dynamic consensus .
I think that one consensus that has clearly emerged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged Europe .
we have a Europe in the process of reunification .
our enlargement is an enlargement that has only just begun .
we have signed the treaties and have ten new Member States among us , but we have to do all we can so that we can soon stop talking about old and new Member States and become a real Union , and for that we need an active cohesion policy .
that is why I keep returning to the idea of a plan of values , and solidarity is certainly a value that can unite us .
that is why I say that now , when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe , I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national , regional and local identities .
European diversity is what truly defines our identity and , if we want to define identity , we must define it in terms of the values enshrined in the European Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , that is , respect for the dignity of the human being , for human rights , for justice , for the rule of law and for the principles of freedom and equality .
these are the values that define our identity .
respect for the principle of non @-@ discrimination and tolerance towards anyone who comes in through our borders .
it is therefore on the basis of these values that we can promote the idea of Europe around the world .
I said in my first speech that it is on the basis of these values that we can best look after our interests .
we are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbourhood policy : a policy for our Eastern or Mediterranean neighbours that promotes stability and peace , as we have been doing in Ukraine , for example .
I should like to underline something that has not always been put into words .
the signals that the European Union has sent out during the current crisis in Ukraine have been highly positive .
without any competition for the limelight , we have had the Council Presidency , the European Council , the European Commission and some Member States all involved in seeking a peaceful , democratic solution for Ukraine .
that reflects very well on our Europe .
we must also , however , have a generous development policy .
as I have already said , Europe cannot be selfish .
the policy must reflect externally what we now do internally , having overcome a great many historical conflicts by means of collaboration between Member States that were very often at war with each other in the past .
that is why I believe we have the duty to advocate effective multilateralism , whereby we work on a platform of equality and respect with our principal partners , we seek to revitalise the transatlantic alliance , and unite all our partners around values such as freedom , peace and democracy .
that is how Europe progresses - by enriching its heritage , by building and renewing a dynamic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qualities that make it so different .
I should like to finish , ladies and gentlemen , by assuring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliament &apos;s positions , so as to incorporate those positions into what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or another , but a strategic vision for all European institutions and for the European Union as a whole throughout the next five years .
at the conclusion of this debate , I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure . ( 1 )
the vote will take place on Thursday .
the debate is closed .
we shall proceed to the formal sitting for the award of the Sakharov Prize to the Association of Journalists of Belarus .
it is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2004 , a prize which the European Parliament is awarding to the Association of Journalists of Belarus , headed by its President , Mrs Zhanna Litvina .
I would like to welcome you in your language : , Mrs Litvina .
I must inform Parliament that the representatives of the Association of Journalists of Belarus include Svetlana Zavadskaya , whose husband has been missing since July 2000 .
we wish to express our sympathy and solidarity with Mrs Zavadskaya and her family at this very difficult time .
this prize recognises a group of professionals who risk their lives on a daily basis to seek out the truth and communicate it to their citizens .
in 2004 , more than 50 journalists have been murdered throughout the world , together with 14 media assistants .
around 200 have been imprisoned and we should remember that two French journalists have been held in Iraq for more than 100 days now .
2004 has not been Belarus &apos;s best year .
the pressure from the authorities on the independent media has increased considerably .
the State has continued to silence critical voices , imposing fines , systematically suspending and closing newspapers , harassing journalists and taking criminal action against them .
freedom is what society has the right to do and know and what the State does not have the right to hinder .
in Belarus , however , it is hindered .
within Belarus &apos;s dictatorial system , the result of elections not recognised by the international community , access to information not filtered by the authorities involves risk , and the Association of Journalists of Belarus and its one thousand members , being awarded this prize today , run that risk every day .
having suffered various methods of traditional censorship , the Association manages , courageously , to broadcast its information via the Internet .
but the authorities continue to pursue you and , nevertheless , you continue to try to keep the public aware of the right to freedom of expression and the need to exercise it .
the attacks suffered by your Association are attacks against fundamental human rights , which are enshrined in the Charter of Rights and in the draft European Constitution .
Madam President , I would like to inform you that we in the European Parliament have decided that our Delegation for Relations with Belarus will not maintain relations with the authorities of the regime , and will only maintain them and promote them with the NGOs and with civil society .
we are all saddened and frustrated to note that , 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , vestiges of that artificial division of Europe still remain .
we are frustrated to know that in Belarus the death penalty is still in force , and it is the only country in this continent which still applies it .
the prize we are awarding today reminds us that there are borders within Europe which restrict the application of our values .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you that our Parliament usually stays in contact with previous winners of the Sakharov prize and that this month it will be 14 years since we awarded this prize to Aung San Suu Kyi , who is still under arrest in Myanmar , and whose immediate release we continue to demand .
Madam President , perhaps I should make it absolutely clear that , when you have returned to your country , we will continue to support you through all of our resources and we call on the Belarusian authorities to respect your rights and freedoms .
I would like to congratulate you on the work you are doing in Belarusian : , Mrs Litvina .
you have the floor .
( 1 ) Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , Ladies and Gentlemen , this is a very emotional moment for me , because this is an extremely important , significant moment for my colleagues and I. The fact that we are receiving this prize as an organisation is a sign of solidarity and support for the entire Belarusian democratic movement and support for the political forces that will finally ensure that in future there will be a link between Belarus and the European Union .
the fact that this prize was initially put forward for two Belarusian organisations - the second organisation was the youth organisation ZUBR - is probably a sign that Belarus is the focus of international attention and that my country , which one of my colleagues has described as a chess piece which has fallen off the chess board , will once again become an independent entity in European politics and will one day take a worthy place among the other nations around the European table .
the prize is such an important signal for us because we understand our problems , but they are not just a matter of upholding our own professional principles .
it is also about defending the rights of all our citizens to receive objective , uncensored information .
it is extremely important that our problems are understood by you and by European politicians .
unfortunately , the Belarusian authorities have managed to create a closed society built on isolation and disdain for democratic values .
they protect their stability and survival by means of total control over the flow of information .
the electronic media are almost totally monopolised by the authorities .
the situation is worse because the work of these monopolised media is directed at discrediting any political adversaries , and the monopolised media try to reinforce stereotypes and myths .
one such widespread myth in Belarus is that nobody in Europe is watching us , nobody expects us to join them and Europe is hostile and aggressive towards us , the only guarantee of stability in our country is the head of state , and so on and so forth .
despite our constitutional provisions , there is only one obligatory ideology that prevails in Belarus now .
in Belarus a process has now been completed - the creation of a new state structure which is known as the ideological &apos; vertical &apos; .
there is total intolerance of criticism and we are not allowed to object or express our views .
my colleagues know that we are subject to use of the criminal code against us if we criticise the President .
two years ago , Paval Mazheika , a young journalist , was given a prison sentence under the criminal code .
during political campaigns there is even more pressure on the non @-@ state press ; the referendum and the recent parliamentary elections are a case in point .
on the eve of the referendum my colleague , Elena Ravbetskaya , the editor of the newspaper published an article in which she said that calling the referendum was &apos; a challenge to society &apos; and that to carry it out required a total lack of conscience and total neglect of public opinion .
my colleague was also tried and fined as a result .
her newspaper has also been punished and has been closed down for three months as a result of that article .
again , two weeks ago , a very well @-@ known person , Garry Pahaniayla , Vice @-@ President of the Belarus Helsinki Committee , was also sentenced for slander against the state .
the reason for this was a cassette taped by a Swedish television journalist , which was confiscated from him at the border .
Mr Pahaniayla had given an interview and mentioned the names of those suspected of involvement in the disappearance of Belarusian opposition politicians .
that was sufficient for them to bring him to trial and he may well be imprisoned for five years as a result .
we are very concerned that , despite the conclusions reached in the report on the disappearances of Belarusian politicians and journalists by Christos Pourgurides , a Council of Europe special rapporteur , and despite the international community &apos;s close attention to this subject , it seems that the Belarusian authorities are still not interested in a full in @-@ depth investigation of these disappearances or in publishing such an investigation .
we still do not know what happened to Dmitry Zavadsky , who disappeared four years ago .
he is a journalist and a member of our organisation and the authorities have never told us what happened to him .
his wife , Svetlana Zavadskaya , is on our delegation .
the issue of the disappeared is still in the newspapers .
three years ago , during the presidential election campaign , we were punished for mentioning this .
there was direct censorship .
at the beginning of this year , in the last campaign for parliamentary elections and the referendum , we saw for the first time the summary closure of newspapers at the behest of the Ministry of Information . there were 19 cases of suspension of the activities of independent media outlets .
our colleague , Andrey Shantarovich , actually went on hunger strike as a result of his paper being shut down .
after the hunger strike he was charged with carrying out an unauthorised protest .
this was absurd .
the information about his hunger strike had been published all around the city and , as a result , he was fined for the hunger strike .
suspending the activities of newspapers is aimed firstly at hitting the newspapers economically .
economic discrimination has become one of the ways of restricting the activities of the independent press .
my colleagues in the press are coming up against major obstacles in the distribution of their newspapers .
the distribution of alternative , accurate information to citizens is one of the major problems facing our society .
if a publication criticises the authorities , this automatically leads to problems with the printing houses .
according to the Ministry of Information , there are hundreds of independent printing presses , but already five independent publications can no longer be printed in our country ; they have to be printed in Smolensk in Russia because they cannot use printing presses on Belarusian territory .
I can say quite categorically that the journalists - my colleagues from the independent press - remain true to the principles of their profession .
the independent press , which still appears in Belarus , is virtually the only institution which exercises any scrutiny over the state and it is the only source of free information to citizens .
it would not be possible for us to survive without the collective support of international and European organisations .
I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Article 19 ; to the International Federation of Journalists ; Reporters without Borders ; the International League for Human Rights ; the Danish organisations ; the Helsinki Committee from Sweden and Norway ; the Centre of Extreme Journalism , as it is called - a Russian organisation ; and the Glasnost Defence Foundation .
all these are partner organisations that are helping us , and our strength lies in this partnership and cooperation .
it is very important for us that European society and the European institutions should not weaken their position with regard to the principles of freedom of speech and human rights .
if there were to be any weakening of those positions , then the repressive machine within Belarus would start to go into overdrive and we would feel even more pressure against us .
recently , at international level , many politicians from eastern European countries have expressed their concerns about the situation in Belarus and are prepared to work towards formulating a strategy towards Belarus at European level .
I would like to express our support for that and the certainty that a common European strategy towards Belarus will emerge and will very much help our situation .
we can only combat a totalitarian regime by creating an open information society ; a society that would encourage debate ; a forum - which is a place for people to receive accurate information .
we have a comprehensive programme which we feel will help to unlock the situation in our country .
we are prepared to discuss that with you .
I will just mention a few of the priorities .
we need support for what is legal and what is still working in Belarus .
basically , what I am referring to is the independent press and the non @-@ governmental organisations that are still operating in our country .
what is also very important for us is the effect of the strengthened presence of the European Union in Belarus - something that we would encourage .
perhaps there is some way of establishing a European Union special representative for Belarus .
we feel it is very important that our people should receive a message from the European Union . its value would be that our return to Europe depends on us , the Belarusian people .
we understand that today , Belarus &apos;s visiting card unfortunately implies the Lukashenko regime .
in fact there are ten million people in our country and at least half of those associate the future of our country with a return to Europe .
I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Members of the European Parliament - especially the members of the delegation to Belarus - to support our proposals with regard to staging hearings on the media situation in Belarus .
such hearings might lead to recommendations on bringing our legislation into line with European standards and would help us to demonopolise the mass media .
once again , I thank you for this award .
ladies and gentlemen , the formal sitting is closed .
Mr President , pursuant to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament , I should like to enquire on what legal basis the miniature national flags were removed from the seats occupied by Polish Members from the League of Polish Families ?
is there any legal basis for removing someone else &apos;s property , and on whose orders were the flags removed ?
we insist they be returned immediately .
as far as we are concerned , they are holy .
in addition , I fail to see how they could be detrimental to the European Parliament .
this is an important issue , ladies and gentlemen .
as you will be aware , we do follow the Charter of Fundamental Rights in absolutely defending the right to property .
this morning , the House &apos;s services were informed that a number of flags that had been in this Chamber were no longer there .
even after painstaking investigations , it has not been possible to determine who removed them and where they are now .
I would ask the indulgence of the Polish and other Members .
we will continue our investigations and hope that the flags will turn up somewhere , but , for the moment , they have simply disappeared .
I must , however , point out , ladies and gentlemen , that it has not hitherto been good practice in this House for individual delegations to use flags to mark where they sit .
let me further point out to you that the Bureau , at the request of one of the Vice @-@ Presidents , considered this issue yesterday and that this issue of flags is on the agenda for the next meeting of the Bureau , which will deal with the matter .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
.
Mr President , in accordance with the Rules , I had asked to make a comment about this report , and I am sorry I was not called before the vote .
I rise not because this is a controversial report for this Parliament - on the contrary , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted it overwhelmingly ; and I am glad that Parliament has done so too , because it is about fairness and ensuring equality of opportunity between all 25 Member States .
all this report does is to permit the 10 new Member States to take advantage of an experimental scheme for applying reduced rates of VAT to labour @-@ intensive services , which 9 of the previous 15 had been doing since 1999 .
the scheme was unexpectedly carried forward and therefore was not included in the enlargement negotiations .
I am very pleased that this vote has carried today .
however , this a controversial matter in the Council .
indeed , unanimity is required even for this report to be implemented by the Council .
I regret to say that my own Member State , the UK , is one of those which has &apos; reservations &apos; about this ; and some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs feared that perhaps the UK or others might torpedo this report .
but , more than that , this Parliament has , since the start of the experiment , wholeheartedly supported the principle .
I hope that this vote today will encourage the Council to ensure fairness across all 25 Member States for the remaining time of the current experiment ; and I also say , with the full support of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mrs Berès , that we should be pressing the Council to make this a permanent feature of our hopes of achieving the Lisbon Strategy .
I hope Parliament will support that .
that concludes the vote .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee - European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD ) .
I consider that the European Economic and Social Committee should be consulted in view of the strategic importance of the common agricultural policy reforms in 2003 and 2004 .
since it has been concluded that the main target of policy reform in the new financial period should be rural development , it must also be underlined that more than half of the EU @-@ 25 population lives in rural areas , which cover 90 % of our territory .
rural development is therefore an important political area , a fact that was reiterated in the conclusions of the Lisbon ( March 2000 ) and Gothenburg ( June 2001 ) European Councils .
I think it is essential , then , that we , together with the various institutional players , should find measures that will help to monitor and to further supplement the CAP reforms and to ensure that they are consistent with first pillar instruments and policies , and that will also contribute to other political priorities of the European Union , such as the sustainable management of natural resources , innovation and competitiveness in rural areas , as well as economic and social cohesion .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions - ERDF , ESF and the Cohesion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund .
I consider that one of the fundamental instruments behind the solidarity that defines the European Union is its cohesion policy - a policy that must be ambitious and able to address the challenges of the latest enlargement and the new prospects for economic growth in Europe .
consultation of the Committee of the Regions is essential in view of the strategic importance of these funds .
the Union &apos;s cohesion policy makes an important contribution towards achieving its growth and cohesion objectives because , by reducing economic and social disparities , the Union is helping to ensure that all regions and social groups can contribute .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions - ERDF on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Regional Development Fund .
I think this consultation is essential in view of the importance of the ERDF in correcting regional imbalances .
regional disparities within the EU have become worse since the recent enlargement , because there has been a huge increase in the number of underdeveloped regions .
I consider the harmonious development of the various regions of Europe to be a constant challenge to which we must respond with clear objectives and firm political decisions .
the development of the Community &apos;s territory , which has increased with enlargement , requires greater territorial cooperation , based on joint local development projects within the context of cross @-@ border cooperation and on measures leading to integrated territorial development , for which we need the participation of all the regional players .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions - Cohesion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund .
the contribution that the Committee of the Regions can make to the Cohesion Fund review process is indispensable , since this is the fund that will help to finance projects in the fields of the environment and trans @-@ European networks on the subject of transport infrastructure .
I believe that this review should retain the basic principles that define this policy and base itself on a global balance between strengthening the strategic dimension on the one hand and simplifying the implementation system on the other , without thereby creating a situation that reduces solidarity among the Member States , which is both a principle and a characteristic of this Union of States .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions - European grouping of cross @-@ border cooperation ( EGCC ) on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European grouping of cross @-@ border cooperation ( EGCC ) .
the Committee of the Regions ought to be consulted in view of the importance of the powers exercised by bodies with local and regional power in their capacity as public authorities .
in view of the serious difficulties encountered by the Member States , regions and local authorities in carrying out and managing cross @-@ border , transnational and interregional cooperation measures in a context of different national laws and procedures , it is essential to adopt adequate measures at Community level to alleviate such difficulties .
this new Community @-@ level cooperation instrument will allow the creation of Community territory of cooperative groupings with their own legal personality , called &apos; European groupings of cross @-@ border cooperation &quot; ( EGCC ) .
the harmonious development of the Community as a whole and the strengthening of economic , social and territorial cohesion require a strengthening of cross @-@ border cooperation and the adoption of measures providing for the removal of obstacles that hinder cross @-@ border cooperation .
.- The full , harmonious integration of the ten new Member States requires the adaptation of all protocols previously confined to the 15 Member States , and it also requires that this adaptation should take place as soon as possible .
.- This proposal is the result of the authorisation granted by the Council of the European Union to the European Commission on 26 January 2004 to undertake and conclude negotiations with Mexico , with a view to the conclusion of an Additional Protocol to the Economic Partnership , Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States , of the one part , and the United Mexican States , of the other part , to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the European Union .
the accession of the above @-@ mentioned new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adaptations so as to place them on an equal footing in the customs , economic and competition fields .
I voted for the proposal .
.- The full , harmonious integration of the ten new Member States requires the adaptation of all protocols previously confined to the 15 Member States , and it also requires that this adaptation should take place as soon as possible .
the accession of these new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adaptations so as to place them on an equal footing in the customs , economic and competition fields . I have voted for the proposal .
.- I voted for the proposal for a Council directive because I believe it has already been afforded sufficient unequivocal scrutiny and appreciation in the Committee on Agriculture , where it gained well @-@ deserved , unanimous approval .
nonetheless , I wonder whether it is worthwhile and necessary for such questions that merely correct or update legislation to have to follow the same procedure ( albeit simplified ) as other reports that deal with significantly more important topics .
in fact , in the case in point , I believe that the change made to Directive 87 / 328 / EEC can only be understood in the light of an excessively positivist interpretation of Community law , since the storage of frozen semen of bovine animals that is provided for at &apos; semen collection centres &quot; ( with own production ) could , by recourse to ordinary rules of legal interpretation , include the &apos; semen storage centres &quot; ( without own production ) without any formal correction being necessary .
it may sound trivial , but sometimes even the ridiculous can be treated seriously , or something serious can seem ridiculous .
.- I welcome the proposal to amend the Council regulation on support for rural development from the EAGGF &apos; in order to prevent any difference in treatment between the Member States &quot; that made up the European Union before enlargement and the current 25 countries .
it should be noted that this measure arises in the context of a debate on the budget in which there will be a real cut in funds compared with the pre @-@ enlargement period .
that means the continuation of a policy whereby support for rural development is used as part of a strategy to contain common agricultural policy costs , to liberalise agricultural markets and to negotiate with the World Trade Organisation .
such measures , however , do not address the need to correct the profound injustices present in the European Union &apos;s agricultural policy and do not help the necessary and urgent drive for economic and social cohesion between its various Member States .
the effective promotion of rural development requires farmers , agricultural production and a model of sustainable human development based on the enhancement of economic , social and cultural specificities and diversities .
the June List &apos;s three members voted against the report , since it is an integral part of the provisions for the common agricultural policy , which we wish to abolish .
the common agricultural policy basically needs to be reformed , and the debate on its reform must begin without delay .
we believe that , as early as 2005 , the EU should begin cutting back on agricultural aid .
as a rule , the members of the June List cannot therefore vote in favour of the various reports within the agricultural sphere that are presented to the European Parliament .
. - We consider it right in principle that the level of participation in programmes supporting rural development by countries which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 should be balanced with that of the existing Member States .
nonetheless , we are impressed by the assurance that this balancing act will be achieved at no financial cost to the Community budget , given that the participation of the ten new countries in the programmes will increase from 80 % to 85 % , and by the fact that it concerns objective 1 regions only , leaving the question of the other regions unclear .
what is ultimately important is not the size of the appropriations and the number of programmes , but their orientation , which is acutely anti @-@ farming and hostile to any real rural development .
.- Since this proposal concerns an amendment to the regulation in order to prevent any difference in treatment between the old Member States and those that acceded during this year &apos;s enlargement , and since there is no budgetary change resulting from that amendment , I am in favour of it .
.- I recognise that the Member States that joined the Community on 1 May 2004 deserve at least the same treatment from its institutions as that granted to the older Member States .
I therefore voted for the proposed amendment , since it aims at preventing a situation of inequality from arising as regards the limit of the financial contributions to be made under Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 1999 , in that it is preferable to apply the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47 ( 2 ) to the new Member States .
.- This is an administrative issue but one that is correct in terms of accounting practice since it puts right a situation that was justified before Austria joined the Union but no longer makes sense .
I am therefore in favour of this report .
.- The milk produced in the Austrian regions of Kleinwalsertal and Jungholz is only accessible to German buyers , since the only access to those areas is by road from Germany .
regulation ( EC ) No 1782 / 2003 , however , which introduced direct payments for the dairy sector , left the administration of the individual reference quantities of the producers in question to the German authorities .
at the same time , it stipulated that the dairy premium should be paid out by the Austrian authorities within the limit of their national reference quantity and their budgetary ceiling .
this resulted in a highly irrational situation , as one might imagine .
it is essential to administer the dairy premium in a fair and balanced way .
it is therefore necessary to convert the German reference quantities of the producers concerned into Austrian reference quantities as from milk quota year 2004 / 2005 .
I voted for the proposal .
.- I voted for the report because I believe it is essential that our legal instruments should be amended following the Council decision of June 2004 , so that the process may take its course and achieve all its objectives , which will only be possible - and truly effective - with the amendments suggested here by the Council .
.- Perhaps because I am a citizen of a Member State that has benefited and still benefits from financial instruments that promote development and cohesion within Europe and because I can see the real improvements that they have brought to my country , I believe I am in a position to understand the crucial importance of access to those instruments by the new Member States and also by candidate countries , as is the case with Croatia .
I therefore think it is beneficial to amend the regulations laid down under those instruments , so as to enable that country to have satisfactory access to them as part of the pre @-@ accession process on which it is embarking .
even during the currency of the present financial perspective , the instruments in question ( PHARE , ISPA , SAPARD ) will be able to contribute to structural improvements in administrative , legal and environmental terms and in the agricultural and transport sectors , preparing Croatia to adopt the unified Instrument for Pre @-@ Accession Assistance ( IPA ) , which will be made available to it from 2007 .
.
it is crucial that statistics are reliable , and for that to happen , agreements must be in place between different countries in order to ensure the validity of the data used as indicators , due to the fact that they are recognised and mutually validated .
in the particular case of the Swiss Confederation , this question takes on greater importance given that country &apos;s proximity .
.
the report before us follows up the Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation in the field of statistics .
as we know , relations between the EU and Switzerland have grown closer over the course of the years , at economic , social and political levels .
the plan here is for those relations to extend into the area of statistical cooperation .
I , personally , fully endorse the proposal before us , which , as far as we are concerned , should have been implemented long ago .
Switzerland was actually a party to the agreement on the European Economic Area - an agreement that covered statistical cooperation - but was unable to ratify it , because of a &apos; no &quot; vote in a national referendum on the issue in 1992 .
accordingly , following various bilateral agreements , some of which were more formal than others , it is time to draw a definitive line under the 1992 reverse , and definitively to conclude the negotiations mandated in 2000 , thereby establishing a complete framework for cooperation with Switzerland extended to the area of statistics .
the purpose of the regulation with which the report is concerned is to employ support measures to improve social conditions , employment and the completion of a free @-@ trade area for the area of Europe and the Mediterranean .
a free trade area is , however , best set up through the EU &apos;s abolishing duties , subsidies and export grants .
it is up to each Member State to decide upon support measures in the form of aid and investments , without making a detour via the EU budget .
the June List cannot therefore vote in favour of the report .
.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gargani ( ) on the proposal for a Council regulation on financial and technical measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership ( MEDA ) ( Codified version ) .
simplifying and clarifying Community legislation are important ways to bring the institutions closer to the citizens .
the dispersed nature of many provisions , and amendments thereto , adversely affects the transparency needed for people to be able to understand Community texts .
codification is laudable work and absolutely necessary .
Europe must be at the service of the Member States and their citizens , and , accordingly , must not produce legislative texts that are cloaked in obfuscation .
.
I voted in favour of this new codification of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1488 / 96 and subsequent amendments thereto , which fully preserves the content of the codified acts .
this satisfies the intention to press ahead with simplifying and clarifying Community legislation , in order to make it easier for everyone to access , to understand and to implement it .
this is an area that I have always believed to be of major importance to the EU &apos;s future : namely , making European legislative mechanisms and regulations easier to understand , raising awareness of them and bringing them closer to Europe &apos;s citizens .
as regards this particular issue , I should also like to point out that various recent European Councils , ( Lisbon , Corfu and Essen ) have noted that the Mediterranean zone is a priority region for the EU and have adopted the aim of establishing a genuine and effective Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership .
.
I voted in favour of the proposal before us aimed at codifying Decision 73 / 391 / EEC and subsequent amendments and additions thereto , on consultation and information procedures in matters of credit insurance , credit guarantees and financial credits .
this is merely a matter of formal amendments required by the codification process .
in this case , codification is all the more important given that the issue is of a special cross @-@ border nature .
one last thing to which I should like to draw your attention , which is consistent with the Economic and Social Committee &apos;s opinion : careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of translations , because any inaccuracies could lead to legal uncertainty and , in turn , to incorrect implementation of the text .
.
the proposal before us simply consists of codifying all existing Community legislation in this area , in order to ensure greater clarity and better understanding of the legislation .
it is important that this should be the case .
there have been many directives regulating the minimum level of crude oil and / or petroleum products .
broadly speaking , all of those directives stress the fundamental importance of such products to the Community &apos;s supply of energy products .
these products come from third countries , and a reduction in their supply might have serious effects on the European Community &apos;s economic activity .
against this backdrop , the proposal before us seeks to help European citizens to be aware of and to understand the rules and , more importantly , seeks to create the necessary conditions to solve any potential shortage of this vital energy source .
I therefore voted in favour .
we believe it is those countries situated around the Baltic Sea that must deal with the issue of the future management of fishing resources in the Baltic .
we believe that the European Communities should not have that competence .
the issue of managing the world &apos;s fishing resources must be dealt with partly via the United Nations and , in the case of the Baltic , between the Baltic countries .
we have therefore chosen to vote against this report .
.
I welcome this report fulfilling the European Parliament &apos;s requirement to verify the credentials of its Members , ( under the terms of Article 12 of the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , as amended by the Council decision of 25 June / 22 September 2002 ) working on an EU and Member State level .
this report highlights the need to update the current provisions of the Rules of Procedure , making them more compatible with the new provisions of the 1976 Act .
in particular , this report emphasises the need to combat certain loopholes arising in the transition from one parliament to the next .
for example , dual parliamentary mandate issues .
.
the issue before us is a Commission proposal on the future management of the fisheries resources of the Baltic Sea and the Belts .
the proposal seeks to reshape the nature of the relationship between the EU and third countries that are party to agreements concluded on the above @-@ mentioned sea areas , following the recent accession to the EU of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland .
currently , and until December 2005 , the future management of fisheries resources of the Baltic Sea and the Belts is regulated by the 1973 agreement , concluded by the European Community , the Baltic States , Poland and Russia , known as the Gdansk Convention .
as a direct result of their accession to the EU , the above @-@ mentioned Member States withdrew from the agreement .
consequently , the agreement now applies solely between the EU and the Russian Federation .
the Commission therefore proposes the Community &apos;s withdrawal from the agreement .
if this does not happen , relations between the EU and Russia would be regulated by an instrument created for multilateral cooperation , and this might have adverse consequences .
I support the rapporteur in that I welcome this proposal and , at the same time , I understand the concerns that the objectives of protecting ...
we believe that the European Convention should be granted discharge for 2003 , because there are no reasons for bringing the economic report into question .
we nonetheless oppose the Convention &apos;s lack of representativeness and undemocratic working methods .
among the Convention &apos;s just over one hundred members , women , young people and critics of the EU were seriously under @-@ represented .
the Convention cannot therefore claim to represent the citizens of Europe .
what is more , the Convention &apos;s President , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , and his Praesidium designed policy as they themselves saw fit .
proposals were introduced that have no basis in the working groups or in plenary .
no votes took place in plenary , and Giscard himself decided how the majorities looked .
we share the analysis made by Gisela Stuart , a British member of the Convention &apos;s Praesidium , in her book &apos; The Making of Europe &apos;s Constitution &quot; ( Fabian Society , 2003 ) .
in her view , the work of the Convention was shaped by an unaccountable political elite that had already decided the final outcome from the outset .
.
given that this expenditure was validated by the Court of Auditors , which felt that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2003 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were , on the whole , legal and regular , I am voting in favour of this recommendation .
.
I share the rapporteur &apos;s conclusion that , in light of the assent given by the Council on 8 July 2004 and by the Commission on 19 October 2004 and the compliance acknowledged by the Court of Auditors on 13 May 2004 , there does not appear to be any justification for Parliament to withhold its assent to the granting of discharge for the financial year 2003 to the Secretary @-@ General of the Convention .
I naturally welcome the transparency and , to use the word of the Court of Auditors , the reliability , of the accounts for the financial year .
I also agree that the residue should be apportioned between the three Institutions that contributed to the Convention &apos;s budget .
I voted in favour .
the members of the June List have chosen to vote against the report because the Committee on Budgets &quot; proposed changes open the way to further EU commitments , without any requirement for coordination with other international financial institutions .
the June List is opposed to the Commission &apos;s proposal and believes that the EIB should not issue the proposed loan guarantee .
the June List recommends instead that those countries that are affected by loan guarantees and that benefit from these should themselves stand as guarantors of those loans or find other players in the free market to do so .
according to the June List , the proposal is not in the Community &apos;s interest but is in danger of becoming an expensive failure if loan guarantees are given without being tested by the market in the usual way .
the June List would ideally have liked to have seen the Commission &apos;s proposal too rejected in the vote but , ironically , finds the Commission &apos;s original proposal less objectionable than the one presented by the Committee on Budgets .
.
on the proposal for a Council decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for certain types of projects in Russia and the Western New Independent States ( WNIS ) .
the EU &apos;s external policy is , in this case , expressed through a &apos; Neighbourhood Policy , &quot; which will enable those countries to continue on the path to economic , social and political development .
it strikes me as important to point out that the EU &apos;s external lending capacity is an important foreign policy development instrument and , in turn , a powerful tool in the overall capacity of the EU to contribute to development and security in our immediate neighbourhood .
.
I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision before us , which falls within the scope of the Commission &apos;s communication of March 2003 entitled &apos; Wider Europe - Neighbourhood : a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours , &quot; which laid down a strategy for creating a &apos; circle of friends &quot; - an area of shared values , stability and prosperity , and one in which it is possible to achieve deeper economic integration .
I welcome the approach that the decision is to cover the activity of the EIB &apos;s loans until the end of January 2007 , earmarked for areas such as the environment , transport , telecommunications and energy infrastructure .
a further reason to welcome this proposal is that it is duly consistent with the EU @-@ Russia Summit held in the Hague on 25 November 2004 , aimed at promoting strategic partnerships and deepening what are referred to as the &apos; Four Common Spaces , &quot; namely , a common economic space ; a common space of freedom , security and justice ; a common space in the field of external security ; and a common space of research , education and culture .
.
the issue before us is the third readmission agreement between the European Community and a third country , which forms part of the so @-@ called &apos; fight against illegal immigration . &quot;
the rapporteur points out , and I quote , that &apos; negotiations of readmission agreements are moving forward with difficulty , in particular because of the problems the European Union has in offering anything in exchange for the agreements . &quot;
this essentially boils down to expelling all workers , who , eager for a new life , emigrate to another country , but who find themselves faced with human resources &apos; management , &quot; which sifts them and removes those it deems surplus to requirements , and this is something that we have repeatedly condemned .
this process forms part of a tendency towards &apos; globally &quot; exploiting the workforce , and these agreements are no more than one of the visible faces of that tendency .
hence our vote against .
the readmission agreement with Sri Lanka is part and parcel of the introduction of a common immigration policy .
the June List does not , however , wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe .
measures concerning illegal immigration and residence , including the repatriation of illegal immigrants , should be an issue for the Member States &quot; national parliaments .
consequently , we are voting against the report .
.
agreements of this kind , which have been signed with various countries , are of major importance in the fight against illegal immigration .
they are also concerned with safeguarding respect for human rights , given that we must remain vigilant to ensure that the law is being strictly complied with .
I am therefore in favour of their adoption .
.
on the subject of the management of migratory flows , based on the Amsterdam Treaty , the Tampere Summit called for &apos; assistance to countries of origin and transit to be developed in order to promote voluntary return as well as to help the authorities of those countries to strengthen their ability to combat effectively trafficking in human beings and to cope with their readmission obligations towards the Union and the Member States &quot; ( IV.26. ) .
the purpose of the proposal for a decision before us is to regulate the conditions under which the EU and the Sri Lankan authorities will readmit people who do not have legal residence in each other &apos;s territory , a practice that the Community would like to see included in all future agreements with third countries ; and rightly so in my view .
notwithstanding the need for strict controls on access to the Community area , which must be kept up , I share the Foreign Affairs Committee &apos;s desire to ensure that the need to respect human rights is never overlooked .
I voted in favour .
.
the Commission did not manage to obtain a unanimous decision in the Council on its proposal for a directive on simplifying and streamlining reduced VAT rates .
consequently , the period of application of Directive 1999 / 85 / EU , authorising Member States to apply , on an experimental basis , a reduced VAT rate on labour @-@ intensive services , has been repeatedly extended , and now comes to an end on 31 December 2005 .
the purpose of this recasting of the Directive is to make it possible for the new Member States , following enlargement , to apply it , and this is something that we welcome .
whilst the Commission &apos;s assessment report says that the effects of this measure are negligible and that the cost / benefit ratio is unfavourable , the Commission &apos;s main objective revolves around the difficulty of harmonising VAT , although it does state that this measure does not prejudice the rules of the internal market .
although we have certain reservations about this measure , and taking account of the fact that the measure will not solve the problems of high unemployment in the EU , we feel that this authorisation should be maintained for Member States that wish to apply it permanently .
this will contribute further towards creating jobs and towards combating the parallel economy .
we hope that the new Member States will make their contribution towards achieving this aim .
.
the adoption by the Council , on 22 October 1999 , of Directive 1999 / 85 / EC amending Directive 77 / 88 / EEC , was intended to foster the experimental scheme of reduced VAT rates for labour intensive services , thereby enabling those Member States wishing to do so to test the effects of reduced VAT on those sectors in terms of creating jobs and combating the parallel economy .
the experiment was eventually the subject of an assessment report that revealed that it is not possible to establish a direct correlation between reducing VAT rates and combating unemployment and the parallel economy .
reducing VAT rates does not strike me as the best or most appropriate way of boosting the labour market and reducing the parallel economy .
given that nothing , however , was laid down - the experiment was due to finish definitively on 31 December 2003 - regarding the possibility of the new Member States applying reduced rates , the situation had become unfair .
as I feel that the new Member States should be entitled to the same opportunity , I voted in favour .
.
I am delighted to indicate my support for this Report and for the extension of the PEACE Programme .
this programme has made an original and essential contribution to reconciliation , rebuilding trust between neighbours and bringing communities together from both sides of the border .
the PEACE projects have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations and I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 .
there is not doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross @-@ border and North @-@ South initiatives funded under this programme .
we have voted against this report .
we believe that those Member States that wish to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland must do so by deciding in their respective national parliaments to give such contributions .
the Member States must fund these contributions directly out of their respective state budgets , and the money should not need to take a detour via the EU budget .
.
on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( 2005 @-@ 2006 ) .
this fund still has major importance in rebuilding areas devastated by the instability caused by decades of terrorism .
its objectives continue to be pressing objectives and at this historic time of negotiations on lasting peace , the EU must show solidarity with the Irish people .
.
the International Fund for Ireland , which was set up in 1986 , with the aim of helping to implement the Anglo @-@ Irish Agreement , of promoting economic and social advances and of encouraging contact , dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland , has done extremely useful and positive work in promoting economic and social development towards peace and reconciliation in the region .
the process of consolidating peace in Northern Ireland and in the Irish border region is now , once again , encircled by threats and uncertainty .
indeed , the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended .
against this backdrop , the promotion of peace through economic and social development in the regions of both parts of Ireland takes on extra significance .
it is a process that , at grassroots level , has been carried out in exemplary fashion by the International Fund for Ireland .
I therefore feel that the Commission should adopt the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland .
I am , consequently , voting in favour .
.
a key element in the running of a representative democratic institution is compliance with the principles governing - appropriately - the rules of parliamentary immunity .
consequently , the decision to waive the parliamentary immunity of a Member of this House must be greeted with due caution .
the case before us concerns the judicial process relating to behaviour that bears no relation to political activity .
accordingly , and given the content of the report , I voted in favour .
.
this is a sensible arrangement for the bilateral management of the Baltic Sea fishery resources , integrating the existing bilateral agreements between the Russian Federation and Estonia , Finland , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Sweden within a single bilateral agreement .
of course it is important place a high priority on maintaining stocks of fish .
it should also be kept in mind that the greatest threat to living resources in the Baltic Sea comes from land and not from the sea , and the best way to limit the pollution of the sea is to integrate environmental protection requirements into the fisheries policy .
this aspect should be one of the top priorities while negotiating a bilateral agreement with the Community and the Russian Federation .
.
the issue before us is the creation of an instrument to facilitate the &apos; mobility &quot; of workers in Europe and , in the rapporteur &apos;s words , &apos; to help achieve the Lisbon 2000 strategic objectives . &quot;
as we have said before , the key question here is the purpose of such an instrument ; will it serve to regenerate a country &apos;s human resources or will it merely help the most economically developed countries to exploit other countries &quot; human resources , by increasing workers &quot; &apos; mobility &quot; ?
we fear , and with good reason , that it will serve to raise the number of technical or scientific staff emigrating to the most economically developed countries , and that , to this end , the aim is to create a European labour market , or even a European &apos; stock exchange &quot; of specialised staff .
let me state , once again , that the proposed documents already exist as a result of cooperation with the Council and / or UNESCO .
hence our vote in favour , albeit with criticisms of the attempts to contaminate apparently positive aims .
we do not believe it necessary for the EU to create a standard document portfolio that EU citizens will be able to use in job applications .
the EU institutions can , of course , have a standard document portfolio for those seeking employment with these institutions .
such a document portfolio should not , however , be turned into a compulsory standard requirement .
instead , this is an area in which the Member States themselves must be able to take decisions .
.
I congratulate Mrs Novak on her excellent work on the establishment of a single Community framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences - Europass .
the aim of this proposal is to create a uniform &apos; portfolio &quot; of documents that will enable citizens applying for a job or a course of study to set out their personal qualifications in a manner that is comparable throughout the EU .
Europass will facilitate professional mobility and encourage learning in Europe , and this will help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy .
I endorse the creation of Europass because mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in reducing the skills shortfall in the European labour market .
I am convinced that it will provide the necessary impetus to break down the barriers that European citizens come up against in this field .
I should also like to underline the need to avoid prolonging the legislative process , and therefore voted in favour of Europass , which will enable it to enter into force as early as January 2005 .
.
in line with the aim of greater coordination , streamlining and transparency of qualifications and skills , we must promote the integration of measures in the area of the certification of qualifications into a single framework .
this is not an issue of recognising diplomas , but of simplifying the processes for setting out qualifications and skills .
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation .
.
the legislative proposal before us aims to create a single &apos; portfolio &quot; of documents , which will enable citizens to set out their abilities , skills and qualifications and will facilitate the recognition in the labour market of training courses and work experience undertaken abroad .
it will therefore foster professional and educational mobility in Europe .
in addition to making qualifications and skills comparable , the proposal before us also helps to achieve the Lisbon 2000 objectives , to turn Europe into the &apos; most dynamic and competitive area in the world &quot; by 2010 .
accordingly , Europass - which comprises documents referring to training courses in different countries , to higher education , to knowledge of languages and to professional training - will make a major contribution not only to these objectives , but also to an increase in the quality of general and professional education in Europe .
this is a welcome and highly important measure for young people .
as such , it must enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
I voted in favour .
. - The Europass is yet another lever to replace systematic and integrated education with fragmented skills and outdated training adapted to current market demands , in the aim of exploiting workers and in full harmonisation with the Lisbon strategy .
it makes employers alone responsible for the evaluation of educational and vocational qualifications , so that they can select the most &apos; convenient &apos; worker for their exploitative requirements , depriving the education system of this role .
the Europass is open to renewal and the inclusion of more new demands by employers ; it will also tend to be converted into a tool for keeping records on workers , with descriptions not only of their skills and knowledge , but also of their views , persuasions and conduct .
talk of facilitating educational and professional mobility is a smoke screen .
the policy of &apos; lifelong learning &apos; and of interchangeable individual training modules obstructs rather than facilitates mobility and marks &apos; the absolute availability of man to the alternating demands of labour &apos; .
we call for the Europass to be abolished and for the adoption of : 1 ) a single , free , state education system which will create an integrated educational foundation and fundamental vocational training which will result in full professional sufficiency and 2 ) a high standard of living and equal employment , education and living conditions for workers on the move .

- the report ( A6 @-@ 0069 / 2004 ) by Mr Reimer Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument according to point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 &#91; COM ( 2004 ) 0402 - C6 @-@ 0213 / 2004 - 2004 / 2087 ( ACI ) &#93;
.
Mr President , despite the temptation every year to try to fund Parliament &apos;s interests and blame the Council for everything else , I believe we are presenting a good agreement today .
the annual budgetary procedure is a perfect example of how interinstitutional cooperation should be .
I have been a member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years and I have never believed that interinstitutional confrontation is the right way to resolve budgetary priorities .
I believe that time has proven those of us who prefer agreement to be right .
the best conclusion for this 2005 draft budget would be for the three institutions to be moderately satisfied with the final result .
it would be ridiculous to present this agreement as a victory for one institution over another , because I believe that Europe is made up of the three institutions .
it has been a very complicated year from a budgetary point of view .
we began with a reduction in the ceilings for categories 3 , 4 and 5 , which has made it very difficult to comply with this Parliament &apos;s priorities .
the Member States have applied budgetary rigour , as a consequence of the Stability Pact , and that must continue in the future .
we have had European elections : new MEPs , a new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , who has worked very well and I congratulate him on that ; a new Commission and a new Commissioner , who has also worked very well and I congratulate her on that as well , and I also congratulate former Commissioner Schreyer .
ladies and gentlemen , since September of this year , I have been advocating the following budgetary strategy : to defend the European Parliament &apos;s priorities with regard to the Lisbon objectives , information policy and the areas of security and justice .
we defend these priorities because we are a political Parliament and we have promised our citizens a Europe with economic growth , job creation , better information on the present and the future of the Union , better control of migratory flows and greater security against crime and terrorism .
our contribution to the creation of a genuine Community response to terrorism is this Parliament &apos;s best possible tribute to the almost 200 Europeans murdered in Madrid on 11 March .
I would like to thank all of you for your support .
it was fundamental to our strategy that the European agencies should not be funded unilaterally , at the expense of Parliament &apos;s other priorities .
if we want more agencies , we must provide new resources .
that was our position and I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that this Parliament has achieved almost 100 % of the strategy we established .
we have managed to mobilise the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 185 million and this is a new resource , which is greater than the ceiling of the financial perspectives .
and with these new resources we have funded EUR 40 million of the decentralised agencies , which means that , for the first time , the Council recognises the need to provide new resources to comply with the new commitments .
we have also used EUR 100 million from the flexibility instrument to fund the reconstruction of Iraq , thereby leaving sufficient budgetary margin to fund Latin America , Asia , the Mediterranean policy , the fight against disease and poverty and the democracy and human rights initiative , amongst other things .
we are still concerned about the issue of payments , despite the fact that we have a statement by the three institutions on the commitment to present an amending budget in 2005 if necessary .
the rigour and austerity we all apply - the three institutions - is one thing , but the indiscriminate saving of payment appropriations , which could jeopardise budgetary execution in 2005 , is quite another .
this Parliament will be particularly vigilant next year .
budgetary savings should never be at the expense of the Union &apos;s needs .
the Council has cut payments in agriculture by EUR 1 billion , which , from a budgetary point of view , is unusual , and we await further explanations from the Council .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , we thank the Dutch Presidency for its pragmatism in the negotiation , which we expected , and its great willingness to reach consensus with Parliament , which has been a surprise .
in any event , thank you , Minister , for the role you have played ; thank you , Commissioner , for your mediation .
I hope to cooperate closely with you during 2005 .
thank you to the coordinators , the MEPs , the members of the Budgets secretariat and my own personal assistant .
it has been a pleasure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget , which I hope can be voted for on Thursday without too many problems .
Mr President , administrative expenditure has not of course been the most difficult aspect of this year &apos;s budget negotiations , especially since employees &quot; salary increases were clearly to remain below 1 % this year instead of 2.6 % , as originally foreseen .
with the figures from Parliament &apos;s first reading , there is thus a suitable margin below the ceiling for administrative expenditure .
to this , we can add that certain institutions have been able to expedite their payments this year and have thus brought about the possibility of savings on the 2005 budget .
all in all , it has therefore been successfully ensured that the other institutions - that is to say , apart from Parliament and the Council , the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor - are able to make the planned staff appointments resulting from enlargement , staffing reforms and the reform of financial administration .
in practice , the savings due to the lower salary increases will now be implemented with the help of an amending budget in the course of 2005 .
it was that agreement into which we entered with the Council .
we are not therefore voting on these savings at Parliament &apos;s second reading but , by making savings by means of a second amending budget , we are also making savings on the Council &apos;s and Parliament &apos;s budgets , which have of course been drawn up in the light of the conciliation entered into with the Council at first reading .
so far , so good .
it is important for all the institutions continually to ensure that the administration is as efficient and inexpensive as possible .
it is especially important , moreover , that we obtain financial gains through cooperation between the institutions .
that is also why I think it important that , early next year - and before 1 April - we obtain an updated report from the secretaries @-@ general on how the appointments are going .
we have seen the delays there have been in recruiting staff following enlargement , and I think it important that we closely follow up how these matters are proceeding so that we might see if there are likely to be problems .
in other areas , too , there is a real need for the institutions to cooperate in their deliberations .
I should like at this point to restrict the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliament &apos;s leadership .
one practical example is the Committee of the Regions &quot; desire to be able to use Parliament &apos;s meeting rooms in Brussels for its meetings .
it makes good sense for us to make facilities available as long as , by doing so , we are not interfering with Parliament &apos;s working arrangements .
that is a decision that Parliament &apos;s leadership must make .
it must be a decision that fits in with our work , but also one that is remunerative .
Parliament &apos;s budget stands at 20 % of administrative expenditure and appears reasonable in relation to needs .
I would , however , emphasise - as I have done in the past - that in recent years we have been able to deploy major expenditure on paying for buildings under this 20 % budget , and we shall thus save on rent in the budgets for the next few years .
this will also happen in the current year when more than EUR 130 million will be paid out on the two new buildings - D4 and D5 - in Brussels .
when all is said and done , there will be some room for manoeuvre in Parliament &apos;s budget for 2005 , and I would therefore call upon Parliament &apos;s leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs , for example regarding translation and legal assistance .
we often have to make compromises , including ones that are perhaps not always satisfactory , for example on the linguistic front .
with enlargement and increasing legislative activity , we need access to advice , as well as to studies , consultations and analyses .
it is now Parliament that is people &apos;s window onto joint legislation , and we must therefore demand conditions that ensure we can do legislative work of the proper quality .
the 2005 budget appropriates EUR 17.5 million to an increase in MEPs &quot; remuneration for the purpose of appointing staff .
MEPs are experiencing an increasing burden of work as a result not only of the increasing legislative work but also of enlargement .
the legislation on which we work is very often technically complicated environmental and commercial legislation , and we therefore require support in our work .
that is why it is also only fair that MEPs be given higher remuneration so that we can appoint staff and , equally to the point , do so under reasonable working conditions .
the amount concerned has been placed in reserve while we awaited a decision .
the decision has now been made ; clear rules in a number of areas have been adopted ; and the Committee on Budgets will thus be able next year to adopt a position on removing the reserve in the light of a request by Parliament &apos;s President .
finally , I should like to say thank you for your constructive cooperation on this budget procedure .
I would particularly thank Mrs Grybauskaite , our Commissioner , who was very active in bringing about a compromise on the budget .
I would also thank the Council &apos;s negotiator , Mr Nicolaï , and the rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , who I think have made fantastic contributions to the budget procedure .
last but not least , I would thank my colleagues , the coordinators , for their constructive cooperation on the budget .
. Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this year &apos;s mobilisation of the flexibility instrument is closely connected with the success of the Budget consultations and the agreement that we concluded - as we indeed needed to - between the institutions .
let me say , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , in retrospect , how good it is that at that time , in 1999 , Parliament secured this flexibility instrument following laborious negotiations , for it has been very much to the benefit of the Council &apos;s priorities when implementing past years &quot; Budgets .
let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument , the annual upper limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EUR 200 million , is intended to deal with unforeseen eventualities , and also that heading 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that , as a rule , this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two successive financial years .
before this flexibility instrument is made use of , there does of course have to be a motion to that effect , and there has to be examination of whether new unforeseen measures are to be funded within a heading or , where this is impossible , by shifts between one heading and another , which is to be followed by discussion of whether the flexibility instrument is to be applied .
we go through this procedure almost every year , and what we have actually learned from the experience is that the interpretation put on this flexibility has sometimes placed it under some considerable strain .
I would draw attention to this year &apos;s result , which is that we have EUR 185 million at our disposal , EUR 45 million for the Peace II programme , EUR 40 million for the agencies - which are obviously among the Council &apos;s really important priorities and are always threatening to displace important programmes in heading III , which yield added value for Europe - and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq .
it is with specific reference to this that I want to point out that , in the current 2004 Budget , out of a total of EUR 90 million for Iraq , EUR 74 million have - as I recall - already been funded in 2004 with the aid of the flexibility instrument .
that manifestly borders on the indefensible . as a rule , that should not be done .
for that reason , I believe we would be very well advised , in the debate on the new Financial Perspective and the flexibility it calls for , to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibility instrument over the past years .
let me take this opportunity to say that we are talking here , overall , in terms of payments from the 2005 Budget of EUR 106.3 billion and EUR 200 million allowed for flexibility .
what is interesting about this year is that , for the first time , not only does heading IV - foreign policy - benefit from the use of the flexibility instrument , but also headings II and III necessarily benefit from what we have negotiated .
the ultimate result of this , and what might be called an additional result , is that the Agreement has also made it possible - in a sort of legal / budgetary emergency operation - to incorporate EUR 120 million worth of funding for Northern Cyprus under heading VII and to add EUR 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy , bringing it up to EUR 62.5 million .
.
Mr President , I am pleased that our two institutions reached a global agreement on the budget of the Union for next year during the conciliation meeting on 25 November .
following your deliberations today , allow me to make a few remarks in this context .
as you know , the Council had not initially foreseen the use of the flexibility instrument .
in our global compromise the Council had to accept its use for a substantial amount - EUR 185 million - and this was not greeted with enthusiasm by all Member States .
because of budgetary discipline , the Council is of the opinion that choices have to be made , just as , at national level , one cannot simply add up all priorities and expect the bill to be paid .
having said that , in preparation for the conciliation meeting , the Council listened carefully to Parliament &apos;s arguments .
Parliament made it clear from the start that it would not be able to finance its traditional priorities and its new priorities in Headings 3 and 4 , Internal and External Policies , under the existing ceilings .
with the agreements on the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 3 , Parliament is in the position to restore the funding for the agencies .
at the same time Parliament has secured sufficient funding for its priorities .
as regards the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 4 , I can agree with the draftsman of the opinion of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Foreign Affairs that the outcome can be seen as quite positive for Parliament .
I also want to mention the peace process in Northern Ireland .
I am pleased that we were able to agree on the financing of the Peace II programme for 2005 @-@ 06 .
we are making a valuable contribution to a long @-@ term solution .
finally , the Parliament &apos;s delegation made it possible to reach agreement by moderating the demands on payment appropriations .
we have a balanced result , which the Commission says is workable .
I look forward to the signing ceremony on Thursday .
.
Mr President , I am very pleased to speak to you today , the first encounter for the new Commission in this very important exercise , starting on 22 November , which directly concerns the negotiations on the 2005 budget : a very important issue for Parliament and for Europe .
after fairly tough negotiations on 25 November , when both branches of the budgetary authority showed skill and flexibility , we reached a final agreement on a tight budget for 2005 .
Parliament &apos;s solidarity and determination allowed it to achieve all the important goals it had set itself .
the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lewandowski ; the budget rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo ; Mrs Jensen , the rapporteur on the flexibility instrument ; Mr Böge , and other members of the Committee on Budgets who participated very closely in all @-@ day and all @-@ night negotiations deserve thanks from all of us for the hard @-@ won results .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Nicolaï , also deserves our praise for having encouraged Member States to accept the agreement : not an easy task .
in the final agreement there will , of course , be some risk that not all compulsory expenditure is covered in what was decided in the package .
according to updated estimates from the Committee on Agriculture , for example , some expenditure was ignored by the Council : extra calls for payments for the structural funds or actions during the year could be necessary .
but I am satisfied that we agreed a joint declaration on payment appropriations for structural actions that can allow a rapid single @-@ reading decision on a possible amending budget for extra payments if the Commission identifies the need in mid @-@ 2005 .
I call on both budgetary authorities to react quickly if there appears to be a need to propose this .
the same will also apply to compulsory expenditure on agriculture .
we also want to emphasise that , as mentioned before , for the first time the flexibility instrument is being used above the ceilings in three headings and we agreed to use the total amount of EUR 185 million for this instrument .
I am not going to emphasise the details of the overall package , which has been very well described , or the main agreements we reached .
I would like to draw attention to what is important for us and is always important for Parliament , namely improving delivery .
each year Parliament seeks to use the budget process to support the Commission &apos;s efforts to improve delivery , which we are happy to accept .
the Commission &apos;s letter on implementability has the same intent .
we have fulfilled the request made at first reading and you consequently released many of the reserves .
I thank you for that .
Parliament is concerned about the way non @-@ state actors and international organisations are using European Union funds .
the Commission will produce a report by April 2005 examining these issues .
you have maintained a reserve for the financing of 50 new posts from the several hundred requested .
I hope to introduce a transfer request in January to lift the reserve on these posts , since I believe the conditions have been fulfilled .
you ask for the rules to be changed on the financial regulation .
I undertake that the Commission will bring forward proposals to modify the financial regulation by spring 2005 , and the Commission has already introduced proposals to modify the implementing rules .
the Council is ready to give its opinion . we await Parliament &apos;s views .
I will look again at your request for support for events and pilot actions .
not all of them are feasible , but the new political situation may provide new openings and I will communicate my thoughts on that to you in January .
the Commission thanks you once again for your fair and firm negotiations and for your willingness to seek a compromise .
I congratulate you all on the great success that you have achieved .
I take this opportunity to wish you the compliments of the season and look forward to the final vote on Thursday .
I thank the Commissioner and would like to take this opportunity to wish her all the best in her work as part of the Commission .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the creation of a real European area of freedom , security and justice quite clearly constitutes one of the fundamental political priorities of the European Union and a major preoccupation for all European citizens .
this is why I wish first of all to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets , and in particular our general rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , for supporting and putting to the vote in this House most of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
of these , several are aimed specifically at strengthening the European Union &apos;s capacity to combat terrorism .
this involves , , an increase in Eurojust &apos;s operating appropriations and the inclusion of a pilot project in the budget intended to enhance coordination , throughout the EU , of the resources and activities for preventing and combating terrorist threats .
we have also proposed measures to strengthen the ways in which all Europeans show solidarity with the victims of terrorist acts .
of the other priorities , I should like once again to highlight two of them , which are in our view of particular significance .
we propose , Commissioner , to hold in reserve the bulk of the appropriations requested on passengers &quot; rights .
we are aware of the disagreement between Parliament and the Commission as regards the level of protection for the personal data that the airlines have to provide to the American customs authorities .
if we vote for the proposed amendment , the appropriations will remain frozen for as long as the Commission fails to propose an active rather than passive system for the transmission of data , as it has undertaken to do several times and as Parliament has asked it to do .
secondly , and I particularly address these remarks to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , we propose to hold in reserve all of the appropriations earmarked for the External Borders Agency .
in order to be operational and effective , Mr President , this Agency needs headquarters - permanent headquarters .
we ask the Council to establish such headquarters urgently and preferably before the end of this year .
Mr President , you have already settled many problems and I think you are capable of settling this one before leaving office .
thank you in advance .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking our three rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done , in which I also include the Chairman of our Committee and , of course , the staff of the Committee &apos;s secretariat , who have provided us Members with the information we needed to stand our ground against a shrewd Council .
our negotiations , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , have of course left an aftertaste , and about that I would like to speak in very plain terms .
it goes without saying that the European Union needs to save money .
we have to draw up a tight budget , and we have to be responsible in our handling of the money that the public have paid in tax , but the question forming itself in my mind is whether it is one of the tasks of the annual Budget procedure to put forward ever more recondite proposals for a Budget when you know already that there will be a supplementary Budget next year ?
such is not a credible approach .
in none of the 25 Member States - let me make this abundantly clear - would the national parliament tolerate such a way of going about things .
secondly , I ask you to try to rein in your fellow ministers in the foreign affairs departments and in all the other specialisms .
I am anticipating the negotiations to which Mr Böge has referred when I say that there is no pleasure in laying down upper limits by way of the Financial Perspective when it is apparent to everyone involved that the figures are notional and will never - it is to be hoped - be reached .
there I would ask you to be more honest .
almost EUR 5 billion separates us from the upper limit of Agenda 2000 - in the wrong direction !
so please let us , when considering agricultural policy , talk about how much money we really need , rather than - as the Commissioner has just said that she will need a supplementary and amending Budget - laying down the amounts via the Budget procedure .
let us not promise ourselves anything where the ten new countries are concerned , and then , if we want the 1.0 % Budget that we obsess about , we will be able to save .
that is not only what I ask for , but also the lesson that I have learned from these negotiations .
although we have achieved much together , all these negotiations now need to be addressed with a bit more seriousness .
.
Commissioner , Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , it is now my turn to thank all those involved in the budget on which we shall be voting in two days &quot; time : Mrs Jensen , Mr Garriga , Mr Böge and also all those who have been working with us .
once again , I wish to express how baffled I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially , for this second reading , at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November .
it is true that we have reached an agreement and achieved results , but did it really need twelve hours to arrive at what should have been achievable by means of real methods of dialogue rather than a set of people who did real damage to the content of the budget ?
we have now reached payment appropriations of 1.05 % of GDP , which is above the milestone of 1 % .
in return , however , we have obtained an unhoped @-@ for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on Heading 2 .
we actually feel that obtaining this result was extremely important , albeit highly unsatisfactory in the long run .
at a time when we are negotiating the next financial perspectives , we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European policies and the Council &apos;s reticence during these negotiations leads me to believe that , if we speak of a ceiling in the negotiations , Parliament should also provide for the concept of a floor beneath which a European budget makes no sense .
setting payment appropriations in stone while moving away from commitment appropriations is a usual strategy of the Council , but this is a strange course of action at a time when everyone - whether in the private sector or the public sector - is being asked to ensure transparency , reliability and truth when reading the budget figures .
this cannot continue and the Union must be as strict with itself as it is with others .
this situation enabled us to release the investments that we wanted in the very short term and my colleagues will speak to you about this .
we also hope - and I am addressing the Commission at this point - that we shall see very good budget implementation this year , especially in the field of information and communication with the citizens .
like you , Commissioner , I hope that this year we shall make progress on the problem of setting up and implementing pilot projects , so that we are better able to meet our society &apos;s expectations .
finally , I am going to take a few minutes to say that one budget heading perplexed us .
I turn this time towards my colleagues to say that , when we agreed to vote for the package on special events , we were entirely in agreement that the concept of European secularism should be fully implemented .
you gave us your word that World Youth Day in Cologne is to be characterised by respect for other cultures and philosophies and that European money is to be used in an entirely secular way ; you know , as I do , that we shall be watching carefully .
the adoption of the other institutions &quot; budgets , which took place without any problems , leads me simply to say that we must review our expenditure here because , by imposing severe restrictions on our expenditure , we have ended up imposing limitations on ourselves and denied ourselves resources for working and exercising our power and our privileges with respect to the other institutions .
in conclusion , I should like simply to say that this budget will certainly be implemented without any great problem in 2005 , but that it is a transitional budget , which does not provide any real means of ensuring continuity and this is what is worrying us greatly .
nonetheless , I think that Mr Pittella will be able to take up the gauntlet even though this method cannot last and might hinder us in the future from achieving budgets to match our political projects .
.
Mr President , the EU budget for 2005 is now at second reading in Parliament .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Salvador Garriga Polledo and Anne Jensen , for their excellent work .
I wish , likewise , to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lewandowski , for his sterling leadership of the committee and Commissioner Grybauskaitė and Mr Nicolaï , representing the Council , for their constructive cooperation .
the EU budget for 2005 may well meet next year &apos;s needs , but there are question marks over it .
there was much wrangling over payment appropriations , which looked as if they were going to be too small .
outstanding commitments at present are about to reach the EUR 100 billion mark , of which approximately EUR 70 billion represents the Structural Funds .
the poor levels of implementation of the budget in recent years have now created a backlog .
right to the end , the Council wanted to limit payment appropriations .
it took much effort to bring payments up to the level of EUR 106.3 billion , which is still EUR 7.9 billion below the financial perspective .
that , however , is EUR 500 billion , or more than 1 % of the EU &apos;s GDP .
this budget ceiling proposed by six Member States thus haunted the conciliation meeting .
even the Council , however , doubted the adequacy of the financing by adopting the joint resolution which proposed that any supplementary budget relating to the Structural Funds should , if possible , be adopted at one reading .
the statement runs contrary to good budgetary policy as the budget has to include all known expenditure for the financial year .
it should be mentioned that at the same conciliation meeting it was agreed to increase the payment appropriations in the Structural Funds this year by EUR 3.7 billion , because funds have run out .
of this , EUR 2 billion was new money .
in the budget debate , the issue of the rapid rise in the number of Agencies in the European Union was raised .
next year there will be 23 of them , of which five will be new .
EUR 40 million from the flexibility instrument had to be spent to meet their administrative costs , or else there would have been no financing available .
in recent times , a lot of Agencies have been set up as a result of trade between Member States .
in 2000 there were still only seven Agencies .
we should therefore take prompt action to discover whether the Agencies are the most effective way to develop the EU &apos;s administration .
it might be that this way we are establishing units that are hard to monitor and which are partially responsible for creating nothing more than a double layer of bureaucracy .
another question is presented by the various associations and organisations that are granted appropriations directly out of the budget .
these earmarked sums are actually against the financial regulation .
we believe the system to be based on favouritism , which muddies the grounds for financial support , making them unclear .
Parliament should remain a legislative body and leave implementation tasks to the Commission , which would be the best way of monitoring impartiality .
. Mr President , Commissioner Grybauskaitė , Mr Nicolaï , ladies and gentlemen , we may , today , be discussing the agreement with the Council about the 2005 Budget , but we are , of course , already looking to see how things will progress with the 2006 Budget and what is to be expected in the coming years in relation to the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
so I will tell you in plain language that my political evaluation of the result we have achieved for 2005 makes me both laugh and cry .
what I see as positive is the flexibility instrument .
I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr Böge , who made it very clear that we have succeeded in making these funds available now - not only for internal policy and the agencies , but also for foreign policy , above all for supporting the elections in Iraq .
that is a success , and it was one that we in this House saw as urgently necessary if we were to be equal to all the tasks set us .
I see it as indispensable that we were able to uphold as part of the Lisbon strategy our priority of upgrading information policy , enabling us better to reach the citizens and voters in Europe .
we Greens also see it as important progress that the LIFE programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have been prevented from falling by the wayside .
I would , however , like to say with equal clarity that what I see in a negative light is the shape taken by the payments for 2005 .
we do , admittedly , conclude that this round of negotiations did not offer more room for manoeuvre ; that is why we will vote in favour of this Budget .
I am right behind Mr Ferber in his criticisms of the Council and in his statement describing the 1 % criterion as misguided fetishism on the part of the Council .
I want to make that very plain to you , as I was very pleased to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr Ferber and I are of one mind .
the fact is that I do believe - and here I am addressing you , Mr Nicolaï - that you stated , not only in the course of our negotiations during the conciliation procedure , but also in this House today , that this House , in exactly the same way as the national governments , must be willing to decide on priorities .
that is indeed so .
my fellow MEPs have also already said that we all have a great interest in budgetary discipline and a serious approach to the Budget .
in the same way , though , you cannot evade our question , for if we have to set priorities , the same must also be said of the national governments .
your belief that you have to make unilateral cuts in which European policy loses out I regard as the wrong approach .
politics risks being renationalised , and , for an enlarged Europe - for , for the first time , we are dealing with a Budget for 25 Member States - with new tasks and new challenges , that would be a mistake .
if you want to fashion a truly European policy , you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that .
I do not at present see that in the position of the net contributing countries and in the obsession with 1 % . that I regard as a mistake in political terms .
if we want to join together in further developing our wonderful continent , if we want to do more for economic renewal , for spending on education , youth and new talents , then jointly , and together with you , the Council and the net contributor countries - and this is where I am critical of the red / green government in Germany - we must get moving in order to achieve more for Europe &apos;s benefit .
let me express , by way of conclusion , my gratitude to all the staff and members of the Committee on Budgets .
I hope that we will continue to work together with such powerful effect over the years to come in order to achieve much for Europe .
.
Mr President , my group has submitted a motion to reject the 2005 budget and I should like to explain the reasons for this initiative .
my group has never argued in favour of a rash increase in the Union &apos;s budget .
we are committed to the rigorous management of public funds and , above all , we do not consider the budget to be the only instrument available to the Union to realise its ambitions .
in this respect , we wish to highlight , for example , the need for a fundamental reorientation of the missions and operation of the European Central Bank .
it remains true , however , that the Union &apos;s budget reflects a political will .
the stated objectives must be matched by sufficient financial resources , otherwise the EU &apos;s very credibility is at risk .
following the increasing pressure being exerted to reduce public expenditure at all cost in accordance with the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact , we have already had , in 2004 , the lowest budget relative to gross national revenue since 1987 .
year after year , Parliament has criticised this restrictive tendency , along with the laborious budgetary gymnastics that accompany it ; such as the increasing numbers of transfers and amending budgets ; the reduction in essential appropriations , such as those intended for developing countries , to be able to finance new demands , for example the contribution to financing for the reconstruction of countries severely affected by war , such as the Balkans , Afghanistan and Iraq ; and the misuse of the flexibility instrument .
every year , Parliament criticises this trend and we have again just heard Mr Ferber , Mrs Guy @-@ Quint and Mrs Trüpel echo this dissatisfaction .
I propose quite simply that this should be reflected , this year , not only in words , but also in clear and visible action .
to indicate that we finally wish to put an end to this systematically restrictive and short @-@ sighted policy on the part of the Council is the first reason for submitting our motion to reject the 2005 budget .
the second reason for our decision is that next year will be the first full year of the Union of 25 .
the success of this enlargement assumes , in our view , that we provide a budget sufficient to take on the unavoidable costs of interdependence associated with this great project , whilst ensuring that this does not involve abandoning regions or populations in difficulty in the old Member States .
I should add that the new efforts , the need for which is accepted by everyone , to support employment , education , training , research and the environment require commensurate funding , unless it is considered that such new efforts are to be limited to just a few profitable niches and a privileged elite .
successful enlargement without bringing the populations of the new and old Member States into competition with one another - that is the second reason why we tabled our motion to reject a poor draft budget .
finally , 2005 will be the decisive year in the attempt to reach agreement between the 25 on the financial perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
as has already been stated several times , a heavy millstone is currently weighing these negotiations down : the need of the six countries which are net contributors to the Union &apos;s budget to have this limited in the future to 1 % or 0.9 % of gross national revenue .
the Commission has drawn attention , quite rightly , to the fact that this would actually mean a swingeing cut of more than EUR 9 billion in the 2007 budget in relation to the preceding financial year .
where would such drastic reductions fall ?
on the great works announced with grand pomp and ceremony ?
on the Structural Funds ?
a little bit everywhere ?
are we going to be ready for action when faced with such irresponsible perspectives ?
if we were to accept without a fight a 2005 budget set at 1 % of gross national revenue , would we not be , in some ways , falling in line with the mindset of the Letter of the Six ?
the third reason why we tabled our motion to reject the 2005 budget was to adopt a combative stance in Parliament before it is too late , on the eve of the decisive negotiations on the financial perspectives for the years to come .
.
Mr President , in EU countries about one fortieth of tax revenue is spent by EU institutions .
in Britain , we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the EU has brought us .
however , we are beginning to recognise , as kindly confirmed by ex @-@ Commissioner Kinnock , that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and cooperate with EU countries and that our prosperity might well be higher if we were not in the EU .
they also tell us that the EU budget is small in comparison with national budgets .
however , national budgets pay for some useful things , such as defence , education , health care and pensions .
the EU budget pays for subsidies to agriculture - subsidies that agriculture would function better without .
it pays for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered worthwhile .
it pays for poorly targeted overseas development aid .
it pays for auditors to find out that 93 % of reported spending was unsafe or riddled with errors .
it pays for this Parliament .
let us stop arguing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda .
let us look at the broader picture .
as the last speaker has just said , several countries with their own budget problems want a limit of one per cent of GNI .
the Commission rightly points out that it must be much larger if the expectations of the new accession countries are to be fulfilled .
how much larger - two per cent , four per cent ?
if the EU were genuinely concentrating on the ideals it keeps proclaiming - peace , prosperity , strong economies - it would be acting very differently .
it would not be looking at these various projects : it would be opening its markets properly , internally and externally ; it would cease killing off our businesses with thousands of ill @-@ judged prescriptive rules , and its budget could be a small fraction of one per cent of GDP .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , work on the Union &apos;s 2005 budget is almost at an end .
the Commission proposed a budget amounting to EUR 109 billion , the Council proposed a figure of EUR 105 billion and Parliament proposed EUR 111 billion .
the final figure is EUR 106 billion .
the rapporteurs must of course be thanked for their work , but the question arises as to whether this amounts to success and an appropriate compromise .
in fact that is not the most crucial issue at stake .
what is much more important is that the outcome is below expectations .
I can see other Members of this House share my view .
the policy of cuts won the day , despite enlargement of the Union to take in ten new Member States .
wishful thinking prevailed , namely that it is possible to have a larger Union for less money .
the agreed level of expenditure may impact on the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 , and this is even more worrying .
the Union for Europe of the Nations Group &apos;s attitude to the 2005 budget is that it is something that cannot currently be opposed , but we see no reason for rejoicing .
this is also an opportunity for broader reflection .
George Kennan observed in the past that Soviet expansion came about because of an inability to solve internal problems .
I trust the same will not be true of the European Union .
unfortunately , there are some worrying similarities regarding two issues , the first of which is economic policy .
to date , the Union has pursued a policy of cohesion and economic solidarity , helping the less @-@ developed countries so as to promote the development of the Member States as a whole .
at present , the concept of cohesion and economic solidarity is being written out of Union agreements .
weakening cohesion policy or doing away with it altogether may lead to differences becoming even more entrenched in the future .
this is especially likely if the Lisbon strategy comes to mean giving up on economic policy , that is , achieving the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost , to the benefit of social policy in the more developed countries .
I refer to protecting jobs in those countries burdened with excessively high social costs .
the second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own identity .
events concerning Mr Buttiglione and the failure to integrate Islamic communities in Western Europe , as referred to recently in , are both relevant examplesas is the question of the text of the preambleto the Constitution .
at the same time , we are continuing to debate enlargement to include Turkey , without taking any account of the fundamental issues dividing the Union from Turkey .
the former include social , economic , political and cultural problems .
the response to the conflict between the theory of universal standards and particular ones has been to do away with standards of all kinds .
those determined to go to any lengths to achieve a federal Europe without borders , lacking ideological identity and cohesion policy , are acting to the detriment of the Union .
they are working slowly but more surely against it than those who currently wish to harm the Union with extremist language .
there can only be one conclusion , namely that in future , the Union must come up with a broader ideological identity and make more resources available , so as to implement cohesion and solidarity policy effectively .
( SK ) Thank you .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please allow me to pick up on my colleague Mr Roszkowski &apos;s words and present a few facts and figures .
for the year 2005 the Commission has come up with a draft level of payments of EUR 109 billion , in its first reading the Council has come up with EUR 105 billion , and Parliament has calculated payments at EUR 111 billion .
this creates an impression of competent activity .
in the second round the Council has come to us with a draft level of payments again at EUR 105.3 billion while Parliament proposes EUR 106.3 billion , which is about 5 billion less than in the first round .
it is totally obvious who is taking the lead in this game of budgetary ping @-@ pong , but it is also clear that the budgetary procedures are still not precisely defined .
if the proposed level of payments is passed by Parliament it will represent an increase of 6.5 % compared to 2004 .
in comparison with the projected level of inflation in the Eurozone , this is a modest rise , but when set alongside the need to finance the political goals and priorities of the European Union there seem to be fewer reasons for optimism .
as long as the quality criterion for the budgetary process of the European Union is the bringing together of the levels of contributions and payments , it is rather a reason for pessimism .
a couple of days ago , the European Parliament approved the annual report of the Court of Auditors for the financial year 2003 .
in the parliamentary discussion about this report there was agreement about one of the key conclusions , namely that the draw @-@ down level of credit payments or the implementation of the payments was rather low and for a long period has hovered between 80 and 90 % .
in this respect the draft budget for the year 2005 does not bring any turnaround as it suggests an implementation level for payments of 90 % .
as far as the structural funds are concerned , the levers for implementing budgetary resources in the form of the payments are in the hands of the governments of the EU Member States .
it is therefore an important role of Parliament to use its political instruments and to gain the support of the media in exerting appropriate pressure on the governments and the Council in order to make fuller and more effective use of the disposable resources to finance the common policies of the European Union .
if this does not happen , the parliamentary budgetary procedure will continue to be more a test of the loyality of Members of the European Parliament to the governments of their home countries rather than a test of the effectiveness and competitiveness of the budgetary process and the use of European Union resources .
thank you .
we will now hear the other speakers on today &apos;s list , with Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra to speak first .
I would like to apologise to him for a small error in the order of speaking , which we managed to put right with his help and that of Mr Lewandowski .
.
Mr President , I believe that , in fact , Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure establish that , following the rapporteurs of the committee responsible for the main report , it is normally the draftsmen of the opinions of the relevant committees who take the floor .
having said that , Mr President , I would like to thank you for your courtesy and congratulate the general rapporteur for the budget , Mr Garriga Polledo , on the excellent work he has done and also on the way he has handled the negotiations with the Council and the Commission .
with regard to heading 4 , we have faced the problems that traditionally arise in that chapter , this year with the EUR 200 million for Iraq , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has pointed out .
we have been able to find a satisfactory solution , but in any event , we believe that the solution proposed by the Commission would have been better because that would have saved us cuts in heading 4 in the sum of EUR 15 million .
I believe that Mr Böge &apos;s comments are absolutely right , that is to say , we cannot take on new commitments every year at the expense of the European Union &apos;s traditional external action priorities .
we must rationalise the use of the flexibility instrument , which is governed by certain rules which must be respected for the sake of the credibility of our European Union project ; in terms of the review of the coming financial perspectives , surely we will be able to reach an agreement on the solution to this issue .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development , Mr Wijkman , for his excellent cooperation and his willingness at all times to find solutions which are compatible with the priorities of his committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Commissioner luck in her duties and ask her to facilitate our work by not taking on commitments which have no budgetary support , because I believe that , by taking that approach , we will be able to cooperate more effectively in relation to the objective that inspires us all .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , difficult negotiations have concluded with a creditable result .
for this we should thank the rapporteurs , Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen , all the political groups and the new Commissioner , who has given us valuable help and whose good wishes I gladly reciprocate .
the agreement can be seen as satisfactory to Parliament because it brings with it many positive outcomes .
it has been a difficult passage , but we have got through it , and have obtained funding for reconstruction in Iraq , the maintenance of traditional geographical policies , funds for SMEs , information and research as well as resources for the agencies .
also entered in the budget are resources for the structural funds and pilot projects , some of which are very interesting , such as Erasmus for apprentices and the pilot projects on conflict prevention and on small arms reduction .
we cannot , however , pronounce ourselves satisfied with the way in which the chapter on payment appropriations was concluded .
I am well aware that this is not the fault of either Parliament or the Commission , which in fact helped us and pressed as hard as it could .
however , the stone @-@ cold inflexibility with which the Council stuck by the 1 % is worthy of a better cause and does not augur well either for negotiations on the Financial Perspective or for the next budget , for which I hope that it will be possible to achieve more ambitious and gratifying goals , as Mrs Guy @-@ Quint also said .
we have gone a little beyond the 1 % mark .
it was right to give this signal , as Parliament will not accept a Financial Perspective which forces the Union to forsake its own tasks and duties , which are enshrined in the treaties .
peculiar ideas are circulating and sometimes a kind of psychological bullying is also used towards the new Member States to make them maintain the so @-@ called rigorous line .
ladies and gentlemen , rigour consists in transparent , effective and efficient administration , but it does not mean refusing to act with the leadership expected by European citizens .
Article 158 of the Treaty affirms that economic and social cohesion policy is one of Europe &apos;s main tasks .
anyone thinking of pared @-@ down budgets , of reducing and concentrating the structural funds on certain areas only , of renationalising the cohesion policy and depriving the Lisbon strategy of the requisite resources should be aware right now that they will be met with the firm opposition of this Parliament .
Mr President , as the representative of my political group , I have been following the budget debate in the Committee on Budgets since the spring .
I am sure that both rapporteurs have done their very best , but , despite that , my group is proposing the budget be rejected for the reasons of policy that our Chairman , Francis Wurtz , mentioned at the start of the sitting .
the problem from Parliament &apos;s point of view is budgetary discipline , which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent .
stringent budgetary discipline is supplemented by an interinstitutional agreement , which was smuggled through the European Parliament in May , 1999 .
the previous Parliament was unable , as is the current one , to have an influence on the ceilings for appropriations determined in the interinstitutional agreement .
the only way to create more flexibility would have been to terminate the interinstitutional agreement that came about in such strange circumstances , but Parliament has not been prepared to do that , in spite of the fact that the inflexibility of the budget has been common knowledge .
this lack of flexibility is in the Council &apos;s interests , but not Parliament &apos;s .
I would , however , like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , and the rapporteurs and coordinators , for their excellent levels of cooperation , even though my group has decided to propose that the budget be rejected .
Mr President , in my speech I would like to touch upon the issue of the budget allocated for the requirements of the common foreign and security policy .
a couple of decades ago there were already predictions that the twenty @-@ first century would be a time of increased risks and threats .
against this background the European Union &apos;s wish to promote stability not only in Europe , but also to achieve greater influence more generally in world security processes is very important .
this is confirmed by the European Union &apos;s declared wish and growing ability to be able to participate in conflict prevention and crisis management activities - and of course the challenges are not decreasing .
it is anticipated that in the near future the number of civil crisis management operations will double .
specialists are discussing possible operations in Iraq , Sudan and the Congo .
maintaining a stable situation in the European Union &apos;s neighbouring countries is no less important .
it is worth mentioning Georgia and the operations in the countries of the Balkan region .
let us not forget that threats of terrorism inside the European Union are a real possibility .
measures to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction are still important .
Europe &apos;s institutional capacities in the sphere of crisis management need to be developed .
therefore , it is very clear that the trend of the activities of the European Union &apos;s common foreign and security policy is inevitably upwards .
seeing the amount of resources allocated for these measures in the budget for 2005 , however , gives cause for concern about the discrepancy between Europe &apos;s political ambitions and the financial resources available to fulfil these ambitions .
the insufficiency of resources needed to successfully achieve Europe &apos;s security strategy is often discussed amongst specialists in the institution within the relevant fields .
certainly , one should welcome the fact that at second reading the European Parliament has allotted 10 million more for needs than at first reading .
however , even then it is not possible to understand the tactical reasons which led Parliament &apos;s Budgetary Control Committee to allocate EUR 10 million less at first reading for the needs of coordinating these important goals .
unfortunately , in order to prevent this erroneous approach by the European Parliament , it was necessary to put the conciliation procedure into effect .
Mr President , listen in on this debate , and you hear the cry of &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more &quot; on every side .
I , too , am in favour of &apos; more , &quot; but of more efficiency and transparency , whether we are talking about the Lisbon strategy or security policy .
after all , we would have the money if we were , once and for all , to tackle the huge sacred cows that lurk in the Parliamentary budget and , of course , particularly in this enormous Budget , which runs to hundreds of billions of euros .
let me just make two points about it .
transparency would also mean making it plain how the political parties are now to be funded , a question to which first reading provided no unambiguous answer .
transparency would also mean another vote on the secretarial allowance , which is now again to be surreptitiously increased .
unfortunately , though , there is not going to be one .
so you cannot be surprised at the perception that the Budget is about haggling , and that you , Commissioner , are described as someone who had conceded a billion euros an hour .
no proper budget can be drawn up in this fashion ; what is needed is explanation and change .
Mr President , I have learnt something very useful in the Committee on Budgets and something which has made life much easier for me , namely that it is best to begin by thanking the relevant individuals , in order to have ample time to do so .
I should therefore like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo , the rapporteur , and also Mrs Jensen .
it is worth remembering that the coordinators and Vice @-@ Chairmen are responsible for the climate of cooperation characterising work on the budget in the European Parliament .
this contrasts with similar work in national parliaments .
thanks are therefore due to Mr Ferber , Mrs Guy @-@ Quint , Mrs Trüpel , Mr Seppänen , Mr Roszkowski and to Mr Walter , Mr Böge and Mr Mulder , the Vice @-@ Chairmen .
I trust the same climate of cooperation will prevail on Thursday , when we dot the i &apos;s on the 2005 Budget .
the final version of this budget resulted from very difficult negotiations with the Council .
we appreciate the wish to cooperate and reach a compromise displayed by the Dutch Presidency , and in particular by Mr Nicolaï , and also by Commissioner Grybauskaitė , who acted as moderator during the tense hours of the meeting .
it is certainly true that Parliament defended its priorities .
it resorted to the flexibility instrument , especially in the areas of internal policy and foreign policy that are very important to us .
nonetheless , those who spoke in the House today emphasised that the situation will get worse .
if we project ourselves into the future , into the next multi @-@ annual Financial Perspective , things look bleaker .
I am sure that slimming down the Structural Funds , together with a tripartite declaration to anticipate an amendment to the budget , cannot be described as sound financial programming .
as regards the budget procedure , 2005 was a year of new beginnings .
consequently , the quality of administration was particularly important .
I should therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fialho , Mr De Feo and the whole team .
they are genuine civil servants of the kind still sorely lacking in post @-@ Communist Europe .
they augur well for the success of future work on the budget .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , investment conditions in the countries of the European Union are favourable at the present time .
we have low interest rates , there are no inflationary pressures , and we have sufficient reserves .
if we compare the economy of the European Union with the economy of the United States , however , we have to say that investors achieve a greater profit and a quicker return on their investment in the United States with the same level of investment .
the European Union must therefore orientate itself towards structural reforms at all levels and in all its institutions .
it is not appropriate to measure the effectiveness of the financial resources invested in particular areas and industries only on the basis of their scale .
in the absence of feedback enabling us to evaluate quantitative indicators , we must integrate and advance the measurement of quality and the measurement of added value .
this also goes for science and research , as Herr Wurtz has said today .
the Member States must be engaged in this process .
each one of them should draft their own Lisbon Strategy , their own financial perspectives and base their revenues and costs on them .
we all know that the main battleground for the Lisbon targets is the implementation of reforms at a national level .
I mention all of this because when we talk about the annual budgets , financial perspectives and the Lisbon Strategy , we always talk about collective pots .
we have finally reached a compromise in our discussions on the budget for 2005 .
I believe that we can approve the budget collectively .
I would like to thank all the members of the Budgetary Committee for their constructive approach .
we all know that the 2005 budget is a transitional budget .
the drafting of new financial perspectives lies ahead of us .
with the help of these we will have a chance of making a better start on the Lisbon Strategy , which would then take on a different quality .
I should like first of all to thank our rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , even though he cannot be here , since it is clearly a mammoth task to examine the budget .
last year , Mr President of the Council , Commissioner , the budget passed through the symbolic barrier of EUR 100 billion .
this year , there is a feeling that the novelty has worn off .
we have reached the end of two great budgetary cycles and the end , perhaps , of two political worlds .
first of all , clearly , we have reached the end of the Prodi cycle , of the planning for 2000 @-@ 2006 and already , with a temporary Commission , we have been and are still working on the 2007 @-@ 2013 cycle .
at the same time , however , we have also reached the end of the cycle of European budgetary modesty . the European budget , in fact , even at EUR 106 billion , is less than Spain &apos;s ( EUR 117 billion for Spain ) .
everyone realises that , with the arrival of Turkey , it is not just EUR 277 million which will have to be added , at pre @-@ accession stage , but EUR 33 billion every year .
ten years from now , consequently , the European budget will have doubled and the question of European taxation will have to be addressed .
we shall no longer be talking about 1 % or 1.24 % of gross national revenue .
we shall then have reached the end of two political worlds .
first of all , the world of Parliament @-@ Council relations , since , in 2009 , the distinction between compulsory and non @-@ compulsory expenditure will have disappeared and the anti @-@ farming majority in this Parliament will rule against the agricultural world and the rural world .
this will at the same time be the end of a second world , which is already happening now , since , in the 2005 budget , the agricultural appropriations have been cut by a billion euro and , subsequently , these appropriations are to be plundered in order to finance other things on the pretext of rural development .
however , the disappearance from villages of post offices , railway stations , public revenue offices and public services clearly shows where we are heading .
this is why I would have liked us , with the assistance of our rapporteur and the assistance of our colleagues , to be able , in the 2006 budget , to create a European public holiday in honour of rural mayors in order to pay homage to the work of the 90.000 rural mayors of the villages of Europe .
otherwise , our 2005 budget already belongs to the cosy little world of a Europe with worldwide ambitions and a provincial budget .
Mr Martinez , I did not realise myself that we were looking at all these things together in this budget discussion .
perhaps Mr Dombrovskis will say something different .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the PPE @-@ DE Group stands for transparency and maximum appropriate use of EU budget resources .
the PPE @-@ DE Group expresses regret that the majority of the European Parliament has rejected our group &apos;s proposal concerning the reduction of the European Parliament &apos;s expenditure below the traditional 20 % of total administrative expenditure .
it has to be acknowledged that this year we channelled approximately EUR 150 million of unspent funds towards advance payments for next year &apos;s expenditure .
this clearly shows how well @-@ founded the PPE @-@ DE Group &apos;s proposal was .
in relation to other institutions , even before the first reading the European Parliament had evaluated the additional budget requests of the EU institutions and it supported at first reading those requests , which were acknowledged to be justified .
one should recall that the majority of requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions are related to the enlargement of the EU , as well as with the new EU financial and staff regulations .
therefore , at second reading we principly renewed the requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions that the European Parliament had endorsed , but which the European Council of Ministers had rejected .
in order to ensure greater EU budget transparency and appropriate use of budget resources , the European Parliament has come up with two new initiatives .
firstly , we invite the Commission , when it submits its annual draft EU budget proposal , to submit information at the same time , on official posts that are vacant or have been reorganised during the year .
this will allow the European Parliament to better assess the justification for requesting new official posts .
secondly , in order to ensure more appropriate use of EU budget resources as regards the need for extra rooms , chiefly in connection with the enlargement of the EU , we invite all the EU institutions to work together and to allow their rooms to be used for the requirements of other institutions .
this will make it possible to guarantee the rooms necessary for various meetings and other events without unnecessary additional expenditure on building or renting rooms .
finally , a few words on regional policy .
the European Parliament welcomes the improvements in 2004 for the acquisition of structural funds and does not understand stance in reducing expenditure appropriations for 2005 .
the European Parliament considers it necessary to pay the commitments set out in the Financial Perspective in due time , and not to defer payments to the last year of the Financial Perspective .
Mr President , these people have got a nerve and I am amazed they have the temerity to turn up here .
they have not had their accounts signed off for the last ten years and they want more money to waste , to neglect , to give in fraud and corruption .
had they been running a small company in my country , they would not only have been prosecuted , they would probably have been jailed !
why should I vote for this ? tell me !
why should any of my constituents ? why should any of my countrymen ?
in my country , there are 2.6 million pensioners living in poverty on means @-@ tested benefits ; there are 3.6 million children below the poverty level ; there are 3.9 million childless adults living in poverty ; and we are a rich country !
we are the fourth @-@ largest economy in the world .
why are so many of my constituents living in poverty ?
because you lot get the money !
because 19 billion pounds of it goes to the inefficient common agricultural policy to support inefficient French , Italian and Greek farmers .
why should my constituents suffer for their fraud , their corruption , and their inefficiency ?
they should not .
just taking back our money from the common agricultural policy would increase pensions by 30 pounds a week .
were my constituents asked to give the money to France , Italy and Greece ?
no !
were they consulted ?
no !
were they given a vote ?
no !
and would they have voted for it had they been ?
no , they would not ; and neither will I .
you can put your gavel down now , Mr President , because I have finished on time .
absolutely , I also regret it because we should have liked you to continue .
in fact , I do not know what you were talking about , whether it was really about the European Union , but there is no doubt that the budget was the subject .
Mr President , it may be that the best thing one can do for democracy is to remain objective about things with which one disagrees , and that is what I shall try to do , as the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not in agreement with every aspect of the proposals .
there were two that it highlighted : the first had to do with the trans @-@ European networks , where , in a desire to send a signal about enlargement , the commitment appropriations were increased .
I see that as a positive sign for , after all , the expenditure must be commensurate with the projects .
the second point of disagreement concerned agencies , where the situation is , as we see it , far more difficult , for , whether in relation to safety , or to transport by road , air , sea or rail , there are many areas in which a political agreement has been reached between the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
when , though , it comes to allocating the necessary funding , this does not - astonishingly enough - always apply . for that reason , where these agencies are concerned , the question arises in our minds as to whether personnel costs really belong there , because they eat into the operational appropriations , or whether the personnel appropriations ought to go somewhere else .
I do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now .
the other point I would make deals with very important areas .
of course we are glad that , in the area of measures to combat marine pollution , which was envisaged and proposed by the Council to be a zero entry , a token entry , there are now some funds available after all , so that we can at least explain to the outside world that we now have not only the political will , but also the means , to intervene in that area .
it will be for the future to show whether the EUR 17 million will be enough , after we proposed far in excess of EUR 20 million .
the same applies in the case of rail and air transport .
there is evidence from these agencies that they cannot do the job properly with the funds allocated to them , and so the warning from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that we cannot wait for the next disaster before adjusting the resources in line with the facts of the situation .
Mr President , I wish to refer to two aspects of this debate .
the first is the references to agencies and to bioterrorism , and I link those two because part of the bioterrorism work is done through the new Centre for Disease Control which has now been established in Sweden .
one of the complaints of this paper is that these have not been adequately funded , so that there is uncertainty about how they are to operate .
our citizens believe that Europe is very often engaged in spending money on activities that are less than necessary .
there are some activities which they believe are fundamentally necessary .
their safety is at the heart of that and it is in our interests and our responsibility to ensure that they are properly funded .
therefore , I hope that in future the Commission and my colleagues in this House will ensure that agencies dealing with issues such as food safety , medicines control and evaluation and disease control and prevention are properly dealt with .
the second aspect relates to the work which lies ahead on vaccines and support for developing countries .
we know how important they are - I myself have produced a report on the health threats to the countries of the developing world .
we know that vaccination campaigns have been effective , but much more that can be done .
in the last four years some 35 million children have been vaccinated - for example against hepatitis B - but millions of children are at risk and dying because adequate funds are not available .
I very much welcome what is being done to put money into the vaccine funds , and I hope we can continue in that direction , because that , again , makes a difference of which we can be proud .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo , for the excellent cooperation .
even though I am only moderately pleased with the end result , I do think he has done what he can in order to put the position of Parliament , but even more so the position of the European countryside , in perspective .
I feel the same way about the Dutch Presidency , and this brings me directly to my major disappointment about this Budget .
with this agreement , we are ultimately nearly one billion under the correct estimate and the Commission proposal about what is needed .
I know that the Dutch Presidency has played a positive role in itself in order to prevent this in part , but I am disappointed greatly with the rest of the Council , where the last Commission proposal was eventually not followed .
which surprises me if I consider the position of Europe &apos;s countryside , if I consider the major agricultural reform that has now started and which will result in sometimes drastic drops in income , but it also surprises me if I consider the enormous programme for rural development that we need to introduce as yet in the ten new Member States .
given these circumstances , economising to that extent is unacceptable , certainly if we realise that agricultural spending will be around 0.4 % of the GNP next year .
that is exceptionally little if we see that European agriculture and horticulture meet the world &apos;s strictest standards in terms of the environment , animal welfare , landscape protection , food security and food safety .
anyone who wants a cheap ride could get a nasty surprise .
we cannot go on like this .
I hope that this will not lead to further cuts in the agricultural budget , but that we will continue to fight for competitive agriculture , even in Europe .
in that respect , I should like to say two things to the UK Independence Party Members and Non @-@ attached Members in response to their expressions of blame directed towards European agricultural policy .
I can tell them that the United Kingdom receives a disproportionately large share from the agricultural budget .
my own country represents 7 % of production and only receives 2 % of the money .
in the United Kingdom , the exact reverse is true .
without this Parliament , the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom would not have reached a satisfactory conclusion .
if these gentlemen can do nothing but make disparaging remarks , they have failed to get the message , including in the British countryside , and they are leaving the British countryside firmly out in the cold .
in any event , Parliament , and the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are keeping an eye on the British countryside .
the citizens of Europe are the judges of our actions .
I believe that this budget compromise allows us to confidently look them in the eye , as it provides us with the means to reach our goals .
but will the resources described in budget 2005 be sufficient for the long term ?
we understand that a state budget deficit makes governments try to minimise expenditure .
however , if expenditure falls below a certain level , it becomes pointless : if goals remain dreams , then every euro spent will just be thrown down the drain .
the current budget is not like this yet , but we should put a lot more effort into certain areas in order for our enterprises to be competitive on a worldwide scale and in order to help cohesion countries to catch up with other states sooner .
we must pay attention to the fact that this compromise , which I support , expends a lot less money than what was planned at the 1990 budgetary cycle .
the question arises now at the time of planning a new cycle : what is the point in setting goals for the distant future , or giving numbers for several years ahead , if we do not fulfil them ?
we , who lived under Soviet domination , lived and experienced what it meant to construct five @-@ year plans from gratuitous numbers .
I would like to see the Union avoiding these pitfalls , I have faith it will , and I support next year &apos;s budget .
Mr President , I would like to apologise yet again for not being at the conciliation meeting , which was a very lengthy and hard @-@ fought affair .
I pay tribute to the new Commissioner , and particularly the minister , who was in charge .
I heard reports that the Council of Ministers was at one in its stance on what the level of spending should be .
as someone from the United Kingdom - although not of the same political party as the government - I very much welcome its statement , together with that of five other countries , that there should be no level of spending above one per cent of GNI or GDP .
I am delighted that the outcome of this conciliation was exactly that .
as regards the agencies , more thought needs to be given to the question of their income in the future .
I welcome the move away from in @-@ house activity , away from the Commission and into arms @-@ length agencies ; but these have mushroomed , which is a sign of their success .
we now need to look at how much more income they can achieve from outside sources instead of just being given grant @-@ in @-@ aid or subsidies from this Parliament .
I speak here as someone who was chief executive of the National Building Agency in the United Kingdom .
we had to turn around very quickly from being 85 per cent supported by grants or subsidies to being wholly self @-@ supporting .
it can be done .
however , I am not saying the change needs to be that vicious .
finally , with regard to structural funding , the very sensible agreement that was reached , namely , to reduce the spend in 2005 but to have an arrangement in readiness agreed by all parties that a supplementary and amending budget could be brought in at any time , means both that we have control over what is happening in 2005 and that reasons have to be shown why we need real spend in 2006 .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion for the report of the Committee on Agriculture , I regret the arbitrary cuts decided on by the Council of Ministers in spending on common agricultural policy subsidies for 2005 .
this is a cut of no more and no less than EUR 1 billion , compared to the European Commission &apos;s preliminary draft budget , an unprecedented decision , taken , furthermore , within the key context of the debate on the European Union &apos;s future financial perspectives .
I condemn the flippancy with which the Council of Ministers has adopted this decision because it jeopardises the funding of agricultural subsidies for next year , which are the consequence of a formal commitment by the Member States to the European Union &apos;s farmers .
the Council &apos;s decision leaves the management of common agricultural policy subsidies in a precarious situation , and this will oblige the Commission to apply spending discipline which could lead it to commit more than one injustice .
there has been mention of the possibility of later on introducing the amending budget to patch up the holes in the 2005 agriculture budget , although so far we do not know where those necessary resources are going to come from .
it is clear that the countries in favour of reducing the contributions to the Community budget have won the first battle , because the Council of Ministers has unanimously supported this cut .
this unanimity also included my country .
nobody has dared to question this decision , which , furthermore , takes no account of the opinion of this House .
at first reading the European Parliament re @-@ established the European Commission &apos;s preliminary draft budget , an initiative which has been completely ignored by the Council of Ministers , the only body with decision @-@ making powers with regard to obligatory spending .
the cut in agricultural spending for 2005 is simply a forerunner of what could happen from 2007 , when the European Commission will have to present a report to assess whether or not it is necessary to introduce cuts in the unit sums of the direct aid received by European farmers .
unfortunately , the European Parliament &apos;s voice has not been taken into account on this occasion .
I would , therefore , like to call on this House to try to prevent this situation from recurring next year .
Mr President , just like Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra , I am somewhat confused about the speaking arrangements .
I am speaking in this House as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development on the Budget and should in fairness have been allowed to speak at the beginning .
I wish to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on his very skilful work , for his considerable sensitivity to views from the various committees and , in general , for his efficient handling of our deliberations .
as current representative of the Committee on Development , I am delighted with the result .
by making full use of the flexibility mechanism , we have been able to avoid significantly cutting back on long @-@ term development programmes in order to make room for Iraq .
I genuinely agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra that we must find a long @-@ term solution to the problem that , in general , arises every year in connection with major disasters and crises .
we must protect our long @-@ term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the millennium objectives .
when it comes to the specific focus in heading 4 , I am very pleased to have gained a hearing for the demand that the budget be more clearly oriented towards poverty alleviation .
this is happening through the increase of EUR 30 million in the appropriation to efforts within Asia , where the vast majority of the world &apos;s poor live .
it is also happening through the increase in efforts in the area of health .
more resources are being earmarked for the work on reducing the spread of HIV , malaria and TB .
as Mr Bowis emphasised just now , a new programme to the tune of EUR 10 million is also being set up to combat other poverty @-@ related diseases , with a special emphasis on vaccinations for young children .
far greater resources are needed in the area of health , especially in Africa .
the contributions we are now deciding upon mean that we are continuing single @-@ mindedly to work with a view to increasing support for the health sector within the sphere of aid , and that is an entirely proper road to go down .
. Mr President , let me start by thanking Members of Parliament for their interesting remarks .
my first remark is in response to what Mrs Trüpel and Mr Wurtz said .
it is absolutely clear that I am speaking here not on behalf of the net contributors , the &apos; one per cent group &apos; , or the government of the Netherlands , but on behalf of the Council .
the Council was unanimously in favour of budgetary discipline .
it was also unanimously in favour of only a slight increase in payment appropriations , taking into account the needs of an enlarged Union .
this brings me to concerns expressed by Mr Ferber , Mr Wurtz and Mr Maat about the level of payment appropriations not being enough for all the needs in 2005 .
the Council &apos;s second reading is based on the principle of budgetary discipline .
the Council was united in believing that the level of payment appropriations was of prime importance . this is why the Council showed an example by reducing compulsory expenditure in the field of agriculture .
in our global agreement , the payment appropriations are EUR 1 billion higher than the Council &apos;s estimate of what is necessary to fulfil the obligations in 2005 .
according to the Commission , which has to implement the budget , the agreed maximum amount is sufficient .
equally important is the fact that the Council will take up its responsibility if it turns out that payment appropriations are insufficient .
the Council has proved that this is not a hollow phrase : it provided additional payments for structural measures this year , as you know .
we have committed ourselves to doing this in just one reading for any additional funding needed , as Commissioner Grybauskaitė mentioned .
it was interesting to hear Mr Ferber &apos;s question on the results in conciliation with regard to the additional funds for 2005 .
he forgot to mention the EUR 10 billion that we got back unspent in 2003 .
in conclusion , I agree with Commissioner Grybauskaitė that they were tough negotiations .
I would like to thank her , the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets for their constructive role in the negotiations .
the result is what counts , and it is a good compromise .
I very much agree with Mr Garriga Polledo , who said it is not a win @-@ lose situation , it is a win @-@ win situation : there is room for both budgetary discipline and political priorities .
at the end of the day it is a win @-@ win situation for European citizens .
- I do not think that the Commission wishes to intervene again .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m .
-the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Borrell Fontelles , on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union , on the preparation of the next financial framework .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Prodi Commission left us with two communications : one on the general framework for the 2007 @-@ 2015 budget and another on the legal bases for the policies which must be funded .
the Council of Ministers has already begun working on an committee , as its representative , Mr Nicolaï , has told us , and we in the European Parliament have created a temporary committee , which it is my honour to chair , which has already produced a series of documents and within which our rapporteur , Mr Böge , is doing very considerable work on making Parliament &apos;s position coherent .
we are all , therefore , aware of the importance of this task , which must serve to establish the political priorities and define the budgetary resources available to the Union during 2007 @-@ 2013 .
everybody knows - though I must remind you of it - that without the agreement of Parliament there will be no financial perspectives .
without the agreement of Parliament it will not be possible to reach an interinstitutional agreement which does not appear in the Treaty .
Parliament wishes to reach an agreement within the time limit laid down in the timetable , but it wants a good agreement , and in order to achieve one , certain issues must be clarified straightaway .
firstly , we need to know whether the current Commission officially accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission .
it is true that you , Commissioner , have already told us in the meeting of the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means , that the Commission headed by Mr Barroso directly accepts the proposals of the outgoing Commission .
shortly afterwards , however , leaks and comments have appeared in the media suggesting that the Commission intends , or at least accepts , not going as far as the proposals produced by the Prodi Commission .
this is the time for you , Commissioner , here in Parliament , in the absence of the President of the Commission , formally to tell us , in your opinion , the level of resources Europe needs in order to fulfil its ambitions .
it would also be good if you could explain to us which income structures you believe are most appropriate in order for the Union to be able to confront its current and future needs .
secondly , it would also be a good thing for us to explore what would happen in the event that certain Member States prevent an agreement from being reached within the relevant time limit .
would the Commission then be prepared to provide for the transitional provisions necessary to ensure the continuity of multi @-@ annual programmes in the absence of a framework agreement on the financial perspectives ?
as you know , Parliament has already expressed its preference with regard to the duration of these financial perspectives .
we believe that five years is preferable since it is more in line with the duration of the terms in office of Parliament and of the Commission .
Commissioner , Mr President , by creating a Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means and appointing its own President as chairman of that committee , which is not normal , this Parliament wished to give a clear demonstration of its interest and political commitment to a process which is so sensitive and essential to the future of Europe .
we know that we are facing some very important challenges .
how to fund the enlargement we have just carried out .
how to confront the enlargements which are on the horizon and which will undoubtedly take place within the framework of the future financial perspectives .
how to ensure that Europe &apos;s increasing role in the world is backed up with sufficient economic resources .
how to realise the policies which will make Europe what we always call , when speaking of Lisbon , the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world .
all of this must be included in the budget , because what is not in the budget does not exist , as Finance Ministers say .
the expression may be somewhat of an exaggeration , but we know that , in order for certain things to exist , they must first appear in the budgets .
Commissioner , Mr President , the Barroso Commission has been confirmed by means of a very broad vote of confidence from this House .
this is the time for you to demonstrate that you are not simply mediators between Parliament and the Council , but that you are able to show strong political leadership .
the financial perspectives offer a great opportunity to demonstrate this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we set to work on the basis of the Communication and the proposals from the Commission .
in order to be able to press on with our work , we do of course need answers to the questions that this House &apos;s President has just addressed .
in fact , Commissioner , there are plenty of discussions and rumours afoot , and perhaps today &apos;s debate will help clarify matters .
for example , you told a meeting of the Temporary Committee that the agriculture policy was a relic of the nineteenth century .
if that is the case , why is there no proposal from the Commission to change it ?
or does it not after all contribute something to the Lisbon strategy and to sustainability , in view of the current state of play where decisions on agricultural reform are concerned ?
Commissioner Verheugen has said that , in order to make a success of Lisbon , we need more responsibility and greater commitment from the Member States , but we see it as also involving the question of added value for Europe , of whether Lisbon is meant to implement the Budget more vigorously , particularly in connection with the programmes that bring Europe added value , in research and the multiannual education programmes .
then , we hear reports of internal discussions even at this early stage about the possibility of moving away from the 1.14 % , and then someone puts forward the idea that 1.06 % , or 1.07 % , would be a workable compromise , so let me , as rapporteur , make it perfectly clear that nobody in the other institutions should imagine that Parliament is prepared to negotiate below the margins set as a network by Article 272 of the Treaty .
let me add that this is without taking account of the European Development Fund , which adds another 0.03 % and has , for the first time , been included in the figure of 1.14 % in the Commission proposal and hence also in the Budget .
Commissioner , you described a crisis situation featuring all the things that can happen if agreement fails to be achieved .
we want agreement , and that is why , yet again today , we insist on a monthly trilogue capable of ensuring that difficult chapters are not left to be dealt with at the end of the procedure , but rather that issues of flexibility , duration of the Financial Perspective and many points of substance can be discussed in good time and considered jointly as part of a permanent dialogue between the institutions .
. Mr President , I am supposed to say that officially I am responding on behalf of the Commission to four questions from Parliament , but I received a lot more .
I will try to answer them as well as giving the &apos; official &apos; response .
I must say at the outset that in the Commission there are no internal discussions on ceilings other than the official proposal that was presented to you and to the Council .
despite media rumours , this is not a subject for discussion in the Commission .
now the &apos; official &apos; response to the first question : does the new Commission endorse the structure of the new financial perspective ?
yes , the enlarged European Union faces new challenges and needs to meet new expectations .
we need to update the structure of our financial perspectives to better reflect these new priorities .
this entails a new classification of expenditure to give a new profile for the Union &apos;s finances .
this more limited number of expenditure headings reflects the Union &apos;s main priorities , making them more visible to European citizens and rationalising expenditure accordingly .
this Commission endorses the same priorities , i.e. transforming the European Union into a dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy , pursuing greater cohesion in the context of the enlargement of the European Union , preserving and managing the European Union &apos;s natural resources - including agriculture , fisheries and the environment - and developing the area of freedom , security and justice and the role of the Union as a global partner .
the proposals before us reflect the needs of the Union , firstly because these priorities identify and represent a common consensus about where Europe must intensify its actions .
secondly , the proposed structure also offers a real step towards simplification and rationalisation , which was welcomed by Parliament in its resolution of 22 April .
finally , the proposals have already allowed both the Council and Parliament to have substantial discussions and prepare the ground for an agreement next year .
the second question : does the new Commission endorse the duration of the financial programmes which will commit the next Commission and the next European Parliament ?
let me assure you that the Commission is fully aware of Parliament &apos;s position - which was also expressed in the resolution of 22 April - in which it calls for a financial framework to be established for a period of only five years .
however , we looked into this question and concluded that for the next programming period , seven years would be the best solution because the ceiling for market @-@ related expenditure and direct payments - in agriculture , for example - has already been fixed by the European Council until 2013 .
a seven @-@ year timetable also maximises the benefits of long @-@ term planning , in particular in cohesion policies .
the third question : does the new Commission endorse all the proposals in what is known as the &apos; Prodi package &apos; , or does it consider that it should be readjusted and , if so , on which issues ?
as I said earlier , we endorse all the proposals .
the Commission stands by the package proposed earlier this year .
we do not call it by that name : it is the Commission &apos;s proposal and we endorse that proposal , namely the proposed financial framework , complemented by a series of legislative and non @-@ legislative proposals adopted between February and September 2004 .
they have been submitted to the Council and to various committees of this Parliament .
the Commission foresees the adoption of the remaining necessary proposals early next year .
the political project which underpins the financial perspectives is based on a number of well @-@ established priorities on which a consensus already exists between the European institutions on the number of commitments already made , for example on agriculture , enlargement , Lisbon , etc .
building on this , the Commission is now also preparing its five @-@ year strategic objectives , which will be presented to Parliament by the end of January 2005 .
the Commission believes that the proposals constitute a good basis for an agreement for the next financial perspective .
to reach such an agreement the Commission will be taking an active part in the discussions and negotiations that will take place with the European Parliament and the Council .
in this context , the Commission will take fully into account the key points of the discussion and will strive to reach a political agreement by the end of June 2005 .
the fourth question : is the Commission ready to take account of other institutions &apos; priorities ?
the answer is yes .
the Commission will of course take careful account of Parliament &apos;s position in relation to the initiatives already proposed and in view of those that will arrive in 2005 .
the package is already based on a very broad consensus about where actions are required , in the light of European Parliament resolutions , European Council conclusions and , indeed , discussions within the Commission .
the forthcoming discussions on the Commission &apos;s strategic objectives are directly linked to this , and the Commission attaches considerable importance to the establishment of common priorities .
the Constitution will mean a codified multiannual financial framework , and I would like a common vision for the next programming period to be our first step on this path .
I would like to make two brief points in finalising the official answer to the question tabled .
first , I wish to remind you of what President Barroso has said in this House : the European Union needs to match its political ambition with its financial resources .
increased spending has been proposed because , with enlargement and with a demand for action in new areas , it was inevitable .
we cannot have a larger European Union with less money .
secondly , I underline the Commission &apos;s strong commitment to the need to respect the target of a political agreement by June 2005 and the adoption of legislative proposals by the end of that year .
the Irish and Netherlands presidencies have achieved considerable progress during their respective terms in the Council .
we all need to sustain the momentum and actively support the efforts of the Luxembourg presidency to achieve political agreement by the end of its term .
the Commission wishes the presidency well in the task of achieving the goals which will be useful for all European citizens .
. thank you , Mr President , thank you , Commissioner , for the first response you have just given us .
in so doing , you have confirmed what you said to our Temporary Committee and the Committee on Budgets .
in short , I have to say that your response does not altogether satisfy us since it amounts to saying that the new Commission is adopting the previous Commission &apos;s proposals without examining them in detail , and that it believes that the ball is now in Parliament &apos;s and the European Council &apos;s courts .
we are in fact looking to the Commission to show not the passive attitude of a mediator but the leadership of a political executive strong in the confidence massively expressed by Parliament scarcely a month ago , to quote President Borrell .
it is all the more necessary and urgent that the new Commission should adopt a strong position now that initial soundings of all concerned in the Council have revealed that , for the first time , some Member States are proposing to cut the relative amount of the present budget , as Mr Böge said .
thus , the Commissioner for industry is saying publicly that there are currently 27 priorities for the Lisbon strategy and that they should be combined into one .
will that not be reflected in the budget ?
you say there has been no debate in the Commission over the proposed amount for the ceiling of own resources .
when will that debate take place ?
in what areas would financial sacrifices be inescapable for the Commission if this resources ceiling were not obtained ?
can the proposals made by Mr Prodi reasonably be financed on the basis of the present system of European Union financing , or does the Commission believe that negotiations should cover income as well as expenditure ?
finally , what provisional measures should be taken , and when , if , as seems highly likely , the Council fails to reach a consensus before the process of ratifying the Constitution is completed ?
as you have reminded us , President Barroso says we cannot have more Europe for less money .
how much money does the policy proposed by President Barroso require ?
. Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking today in my capacity as my group &apos;s coordinator in the Committee on Regional Development , which has the second largest individual budget to deal with , as the budget for cohesion and structural policy , with a 35 % share , is second only in size to the budget for agriculture .
alongside the tasks we have to perform in dealing with the Financial Perspective , the specialist committees and most especially the Committee on Regional Development have the task of preparing the relevant Regulations for each Fund for the new financial period of 2007 to 2013 .
I see the anchoring of this cohesion and structural policy , including in our Constitution , on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions , as creating very modern political approaches to the implementation of a European policy for the public &apos;s benefit .
what we in the Committee on Regional Development need for our work is a reliable statement and foundation , and both I and my group believe that only the Prodi proposal can fulfil that role .
I will permit myself the aside that I get the impression that regional policy appears to be used by everyone as a sort of piggy bank .
the Council does it by attempting to get a percentage accepted while a majority of its members want to make cuts because agriculture has already ground to a halt .
having seen the way you , Commissioner , deal with the Committee on Budgets and the temporary committee on the political challenges and Budget resources for the enlarged EU between 2007 and 2013 , I can say that the Commission does too , calling ever more frequently for a Financial Perspective .
I get the impression that the second half of that sentence is missing : &apos; whether that Perspective be good or bad . &quot;
that is something we cannot afford .
the attempt is made ever more frequently to use structural policy measures to fund other things ; the example I would give is the way in which the funding of Natura 2000 is being removed from the environmental sector and moved to structural policy .
let me also say , though , that regional policy was necessary in the old EU of 15 Member States , and it is necessary in the new one , with its 25 .
we need efficiency , but we cannot afford it to happen that drastic cuts in this area punish a large part of the population for something that we all wanted and that the European Union always has made tangible and accessible to millions of citizens .
Commissioner , you said that the newspapers report only failures .
in Germany , we have a saying to the effect that there is no smoke without fire .
that is why debates about 1.05 % or 1.06 % are not helpful .
let me remind you that the European Union has always worked well when the Commission has strengthened Parliament and vice versa .
we can negotiate well together , whether the Council is on the same side or our opponent .
Mr President , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were very pleased to see that the Prodi Commission attached such great importance to the Lisbon objectives when it presented its draft financial estimates .
we also note that improved competitiveness and increased growth in Europe are among the things that are genuinely high on the Barroso Commission &apos;s agenda and have been so right from the start .
that is something we have also seen following the clear observations made by Mr Barroso today here in plenary .
I therefore think it only natural to ask the Commission whether it will face the implications of its sharp focus on the Lisbon objectives and amend the Prodi Commission &apos;s proposal .
is there anywhere it will allocate more resources to improve competitiveness and to create increased growth and more jobs ?
are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework ?
is there to be more focus upon growth @-@ oriented policy areas ?
are there things to be dispensed with ?
what we have here is a large complex of legislation and proposals .
I appreciate that what exists at present forms the point of departure , but it might however be interesting to hear whether there is anything to which more weight is to be given and whether there are any negative priorities .
if there are to be priorities , where are the cutbacks to be made first ?
when we in Parliament debate the financial estimates , we do not focus upon an expenditure ceiling , as some countries in the Council do .
we do not wish to become tied up in the Council &apos;s blinkered discussions of 1 % or whatever .
I am pleased that , in this House today , you have said that percentages are not being discussed in the Commission either - at any rate , not at the moment .
we must not talk about quantity , but quality .
Parliament must therefore call upon the Commission to preserve a stoical calm and first of all discuss the content of EU policy .
we can discuss budget ceilings subsequently .
we now have a unique opportunity to consider what we want , as well as what we want the future EU to look like between 2007 and 2013 , and that is an opportunity we must not waste .
as far as my own group is concerned , it is important to have the focus on research , to strengthen the common research programmes and perhaps even to consider creating a fund for basic research that can strengthen research in future technologies such as nanotechnology , allowing the EU also to be a key player .
we must consider obtaining increased benchmarking of our universities in Europe in terms of a fair comparison of who does what best on a cross @-@ border basis , and we must create healthy competition .
we must look at our training programmes and see whether they take account of needs in the new Member States where , for example , many students cannot afford to travel and learn new things .
again , it may be asked : &apos; have we obtained the correct focus in what we now have ? &quot;
this , clearly , is the debate in which we in Parliament shall engage and on which we shall work .
that being said , the big battle will clearly centre upon regional policy .
it is regional policy that is the difficult area .
when you attended the hearings here in Parliament , you were courageous enough to express the view that some of the new countries were probably able to absorb more than 4 % of gross domestic product .
I shall be interested to hear whether you still hold that view , Mrs Grybauskaite , once you are Commissioner .
in this area too , we shall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to create quality rather than just look to quantity .
what we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is therefore crucial , and we appreciate , of course , that this is quite a difficult subject , including for the Council .
I hope that we can obtain a constructive dialogue and a monthly trialogue , for it is important for us to go on discussing these matters .
it is quite a package that we have here .
. Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance regards the Commission proposals as a sound basis for negotiations between Parliament and the Council .
I understand that you now want to refer to it as the Barroso package instead of the Prodi package .
that is fine with me . after all , I am concerned with content .
I very much welcome 1.14 % of the GDP for investments in the Lisbon strategy , for money for an economic incentive in the poorer regions and for reinforcing the EU &apos;s role in the world .
my group is also critical of your plans , though .
after all , the future generations , our children , appear to be getting a rough deal .
investments in renewable , sustainable energy sources are inadequate , which is detrimental to the environment and is also feeding dependency on all kinds of dubious regimes in countries where oil flows in abundance .
there is no separate fund for Natura 2000 , there are insufficient resources for improving the reception of refugees in the region and the increase in funds for culture and exchange programmes for young people is too small .
we would like to promote Europe a little less and ensure that people experience Europe a little more .
so , it is 1.14 % &apos; plus , &quot; as far as my group is concerned .
that is , indeed , quite different from what many Member States say .
some of those Member States still apply the 1 % mantra .
meanwhile , they have sneakily become more radical , because I noticed that they are meanwhile applying 1 % in the commitment appropriations instead of in the payments , which have traditionally always been somewhat lower .
that would mean that up to 2013 , we would have a budget that is lower than we have at present , while the European Union has enlarged .
all the while , we are busy making lists of ambitions .
the Member States do not all follow the same view .
the cuts in agriculture and the structural funds are , in fact , very controversial .
a child will therefore realise that those will mainly remain intact in the major negotiations .
where will the cuts be made ?
in the funds for research , development , human rights , the environment , external policy and culture .
precisely those areas that are close to people &apos;s hearts and that are given a visible added value if they are implemented at European level .
a budget that is borne out of euroscepticism will only feed that euroscepticism even more .
in that way , we will retain a Europe that is mainly focused on the market and the currency , and that is heading absolutely the wrong way .
I agree with Mr Lamassoure , who states that we need more active leadership from the Commission .
if we really want - and that is what we uphold , after all - that Europe is a Europe that is united in diversity , we will need to actively invest in this .
I would also like to call on the Commission to use us , because they do not know our position yet .
we may be arguing in favour of 1.5 % , because we are far more ambitious than the Member States .
with 1.14 % , the Commission will therefore be treading a middle path .
I therefore hope that you will gain the strategic insight to dispel all the smoke that is continuously being created and which we think may be indicative of a small fire - you may have dropped 1.07 % somewhere in secret after all .
we urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe .
show your leadership .
prove it in the negotiations , for that is the only way of creating a Europe that is not the old Europe of the market and of the currency , but a Europe that takes people and the environment to heart .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the Union &apos;s Financial Perspective ought to be a debate on the future of Europe .
the decade 2004 @-@ 2013 will be characterised by the accession of 12 new countries .
the Union needs to decide whether it is going to promote the unification of Europe and equality of opportunity , or whether it is to create divisions and heighten inequalities .
research establishmentscivic society , entrepreneurs and others ought to contribute to the debate on the future of Europe , not just politicians .
unfortunately , the Union is not in favour of a public debate of this kind .
instead , the future of Europe is being decided in remote offices .
bureaucrats and politicians are taking the decisions on tasks and resources , and they also decide how to allocate funds and on the amounts involved .
in the meantime , Parliament is busy debating minor issues together with the possibility of broadening its competences .
even if Parliament &apos;s competences were to be increased , there will be no time to prepare our own draft budget tackling two major issues , namely how to speed up the pace of economic development and how to reduce the differences between richer and poorer regions of Europe .
a new budget is required , however , as the Commission &apos;s draft runs counter to the notion of solidarity and is not conducive to speeding up the development of Europe .
this is true both of the proposals and the sums referred to therein .
the best example I could mention is the fact that the countries of the old Fifteen , which are all rich , are to receive in excess of EUR 194 billion from the Cohesion Fund , whilst the ten new Member States and Romania and Bulgaria are only due to receive EUR 180 billion .
it is also worth remembering that a significant proportion of the second sum will end up in the richer countries , in the form of order and of payments to advisers and experts .
in our view , the European Parliament ought to come up with its own draft budget .
this should either be undertaken in opposition to the Commission and the Council , or in cooperation with them .
this budget would be based on three principles .
the first of these is that the greater the Union , the greater the budget .
the second is that the greater the differences in development , the more funding should go to less @-@ developed regions and Member States .
the third principle is that tax and investment concessions are required , as are other appropriate measures for the benefit of less @-@ developed regions and countries .
Mr President , if you perhaps try to explain what this is all about to a young female citizen of the European Union and to a middle @-@ aged male one , do you not inevitably end up making comparisons with the Soviet Union and telling them that we are dealing with a seven @-@ year plan rather than a five @-@ year one ?
is it not the case that the decision @-@ making machinery is very much comparable to that which then operated in Moscow , with the difference that lobbyists are now involved ?
and if you turn it around and tell them that you understand the European public &apos;s need for money , and then consider the priorities and say : right , I really do want to double the education budget ; I do want to double the research budget - how , then , my dear Commissioner , do you make that transparent ?
how do you set it out ?
if you do not manage to make it clear what we need all this money for , public support will certainly be denied to you , and Europe will slide even closer to the brink of disaster .
the President of the European Commission made certain comments last week - and a colleague has pointed this out today - to the effect that more Europe cannot be created with less money .
today , Commissioner , you have confirmed that the current Commission is maintaining the proposal of the previous Commission .
I would add - to those people who are constantly claiming to be Europeanists - that less money means the renationalisation of the cohesion policy , which is equivalent to less Europe .
nevertheless , the Commission will probably soon propose amendments depending on how the negotiations develop .
and I am sure that the Commission &apos;s proposals will be based on the principle of balance .
I would , therefore , like to ask the European Commission to review the aspects of its proposal which could lead to unfair results because of their lack of balance , Commissioner .
because I believe that to a certain extent that is what is happening at this point in the negotiations .
in order to provide material for this debate - either endorsing it or rejecting it - I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the information available to it on the impact on the fifteen Member States of the costs of enlargement - which , of course , is absolutely essential - because the intention to pay for the convergence requirements of our new partners at the expense of solidarity with the countries and regions of the existing States would be profoundly anti @-@ European and harmful to our shared future .
I shall end by expressing my support for the European Commission , provided that it maintains the Cohesion Policy as a fundamental pillar of European integration .
Mr President , the Prodi multiannual financial package is now referred to as the Barroso multiannual financial package , as long as it is based on 1.14 % , although to me , 1 % , 1.14 % , 1.24 % ... is not of the essence .
the real debate is about the question whether we are prepared to actually pay for the political priorities included in the new European Constitution .
it is a case of putting your money where your mouth is , therefore .
it is precisely in that area that our citizens have seen European leadership fail too often .
I have six observations to make .
the first is that Europe must be a social Europe , but in most countries , private and public investments in education and research are trailing behind .
the cuts are harsh at 3 % , but there is not enough room for extra investments in research and education .
the golden rule is not an option in the Stability Pact .
secondly , we are not prepared to make the real switch from agricultural subsidy to rural and environmental policy for the sake of internal social cohesion and our priority , which is knowledge .
this would create actual room for knowledge innovation in the countryside and in the urban areas , with priority being given to the ten new acceding countries .
in Europe , we say in the Constitution that we want Europe to have a central role in the world .
at present , one in five people across the globe have no access to education or health care .
we talk about millennium objectives and about 2015 , but what we see are , in fact , levels of spending by the EU Member States and by the EU itself that are far below par in this respect , despite resolutions by this House .
we want the Commission &apos;s new plans and the Commission communication about development policy to be given priority in January , with broad backing from Parliament , for these millennium objectives in Heading 4 : 35 % for the millennium objectives and 20 % for basic education and basic health care .
Mr Borrell was right in saying that if it is not in the budget , then it does not exist .
that , then , is why we want it .
the fourth is that bad European leadership is at its most prominent in external policy , with major decisions , but no funding .
we want a Middle East policy overnight , and we get the funding from the budget to fight poverty in Africa .
we want a new neighbourhood policy .
all well and good , but the money is once again taken from the budget to fight poverty in Asia and Central America .
each objective deserves its own budget .
we should not have to shift funding around .
the fifth is that we want national fraud and accountant certification bureaus in order to guarantee swift and fraud @-@ proof implementation and subsequent approval in each country .
we are still far too vulnerable on that score .
sixthly and finally , the public wants to see that each country makes a fair contribution to the combined European budget according to its own capacity .
if that is 1 % or 1.15 % , so be it ; as long as it is done according to the capacity and the means of each country . equal shares .
that applies to the Netherlands as well as to other countries .
only then will we receive the support of our European citizens for a truly serious policy .
Mr President , the European Union &apos;s new financial framework is probably the biggest issue that Parliament has to resolve this term .
it is not just the volume of EU funding that is at issue , but what future action is to consist of in general .
the first serious disagreement among the Member States concerns the extent of financing .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is based on the payment appropriations , which on average would amount to 1.14 % of GDP .
the proposal by six countries for a ceiling on expenditure of 1 % is a stringent one .
it does not even reflect the extent of next year &apos;s budget , although the transition phase for the new Member States is only just starting .
a call has now been made for joint liability .
will it end when it is a matter of money ?
another problem is the call for a rebate on contributions by the largest net contributors , known as the &apos; generalised correction mechanism . &quot;
that does not seem fair , as these same Member States also benefit most from the single market .
the Commission &apos;s proposal puts great emphasis on improving employment and competitiveness .
in my opinion , that is absolutely the right focus .
there have already been enough resolutions .
industry and enterprise cannot succeed if there is no serious research and development work .
on the other hand , research is so expensive that no Member State on its own can compete , for example , with the United States of America or Japan .
for that reason , European cooperation is needed .
we already have examples of this in the fields of space technology and particle research .
the creation of new research programmes must be based on the premise that they will focus on projects that call for Europe @-@ wide cooperation .
they must not be allowed to become bureaucratic Structural Funds programmes , the like of which we have now .
there must also be more substantial production of training courses in connection with programmes of research .
it is very important that we should agree on the future financial framework next year .
then we would avoid the sort of mess we saw at the start of the Agenda 2000 programme , which was delayed , resulting in serious delays in the drafting of several programmes .
Mr President , in my one minute of speaking time I shall focus on regional policy and specifically the risk that there may not be a regional policy for some states after the conclusion of the negotiations on the financial perspectives .
Commissioner , I welcome your commitment to the original Commission proposals , although we have heard from other sources that the Commission - somewhere - is preparing for alternative outcomes .
I would ask you to consider publishing what analysis you have carried out of alternative outcomes of the financial perspectives .
that would be particularly helpful to the debate within our own nation @-@ states .
my own country , the UK - as opposed to my own nation , Scotland - is putting forward a position that is as unconstructive as it is unclear .
an objective analysis of what the UK position would mean in terms of numbers and political ramifications would be a hugely helpful contribution to the debate .
the UK contribution to the debate thus far , with its position on the UK rebate , the statistical effect , the nationalisation of structural funds and the limiting of the EU budget to one per cent of GNI is nothing less than a cumulative act of vandalism .
an objective analysis of this contribution from the Commission would be a very helpful debating tool for us in the United Kingdom .
Madam President , the long @-@ term financial perspective is an important document .
it will place a restriction on the annual budgets right up until 2013 .
this will be crucial to choices of areas and to how great a commitment the EU can assume during the next seven to eight years .
in recent days , the Commission has presented its view of the long @-@ term budget .
the new Commission has taken over the old Commission &apos;s proposal , or what is known as the Prodi package .
this means a significant rise in expenditure .
in the case of some countries , it is a question of a 50 % real increase .
that is something I find unacceptable .
my view is that the new Commission should have listened more closely to the views of the six largest net contributors .
they demanded that the financial perspective should include an expenditure ceiling of 1 % of gross national income .
there should be a ceiling not only for payments , but also for commitments .
it is not acceptable , as the Commission proposes , to allow the commitments to proliferate to 1.27 % of gross national income .
that is the upper limit that the Members have undertaken to pay .
after 2013 , there will be no way of expanding over and above general economic growth unless all the countries agree to give up their right of veto .
that is not something I believe they will do .
the Commission therefore proposes that the EU introduce some form of EU tax .
we are definitely and strongly opposed to the EU &apos;s being given its own right of taxation .
without monitoring by the individual Member States , there is no limit upon the EU &apos;s ambition to grow into a federal superstate .
each Member State should allow its parliament to vote on the EU &apos;s financial perspective before the Council of Ministers takes its decision so that the decision is not taken secretly but openly and clearly , with people aware of the financial commitments they will assume .
so that the national parliaments might be provided with a sound basis for their decisions , the Commission should prepare a draft alternative perspective contained within the 1 % expenditure ceiling we have proposed .
there is otherwise a palpable risk of the Commission &apos;s ultimately being forced into ill thought @-@ out cutbacks in expenditure and commitments , instead of having properly considered prioritising that makes it possible to keep the promises made to the new countries .
the debate will now be suspended and will resume at 9 p.m .
the next item is Question Time , with questions to the Commission ( B6 @-@ 136 / 2004 ) .
.
the recent case of contamination demonstrated that the European Community already has the necessary integrated legislation to manage such situations in a suitable manner .
that is why the question of additional measures is not being raised , at least not for the moment , the question being the need to apply existing measures correctly .
programmes for monitoring dioxins and PCBs in food and feedingstuffs are applied throughout the European Union .
Τhese programmes have allowed the Dutch authorities to identify the contamination and take suitable measures to exterminate its source .
there are monitoring and identification systems for identifying the undertakings and livestock units which may have been contaminated .
in order to prevent the introduction of possibly contaminated food and feedingstuffs into the food chain , the necessary containment measures have been taken for these installations .
the early warning system for food and feedingstuffs operated with particular efficiency as regards the exchange of information between the competent authorities .
the adoption by the European Union of upper limits for dioxins played a primary role in the management of this case of contamination .
it is indeed a legal tool for taking decisions which safeguard the protection of public health .
however , we must admit that it is not possible to totally exclude the possibility of contamination of the food chain .
the risk will always remain , which is why we have adopted the measures needed for us to identify and combat such risks .
it is , however , of immense importance to the protection of public health that contamination be identified in the early stages through monitoring and for us to have rules which prevent and avert further contamination of the food chain .
current Community legislation already includes such provisions .
nonetheless , the case of contamination which we are discussing today demonstrates the need to evaluate the safety not only of the ingredients of food and feedingstuffs , but also of the products which are used directly or indirectly in the preparation of food and feedingstuffs .
food safety legislation stipulates that food and feedingstuff manufacturers are responsible for product safety .
the Commission will continue to emphasise this obligation to manufacturers and to monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent national agencies in order to safeguard compliance with current requirements .
finally , as far as landfills are concerned , Community legislation has been adopted in order to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way which does not jeopardise human health or the environment .
- Madam President , Commissioner , the necessary tools for managing risks and safeguarding public health are , on the one hand , the adoption of maximum limits for dioxins in feedingstuff substances , feedingstuffs and food at strict but feasible levels which will become stricter as time goes by and , on the other hand , the apportionment of responsibility at all stages of the food chain at which dioxins are identified .
however , the weak link in the chain for the success of this endeavour are the control mechanisms , especially in the feedingstuffs sector , where the link with public health is not directly perceived by citizens and awareness at production level is lower than with food .
this has also been proven by the fact that the root cause of recent major food problems has been dioxins in feedingstuffs .
what action do you intend to take to strengthen and fortify the existing model of feedingstuff control mechanisms so that controls at both European level and at the level of Member States are more efficient ?
.
I should like to add that , as far as upper limits on dioxins are concerned , they have already been set and there are strict standards .
at the same time , emphasis has been placed throughout the food chain not only on the final product of feedingstuffs , but also on the production mechanism and , for this reason , the instruments used for production will also be controlled .
I should also like to inform the honourable Member that we shall soon be adopting a regulation on feedingstuff hygiene with the objective of laying down strict rules and the critical steps in the production process at which all hygiene rules will need to be adopted and I think that this will address the honourable Member &apos;s concerns .
. Madam President , the Emissions Trading Directive does not contain any provisions relating to administrative charges .
the application and level of such charges are therefore matters for the national governments .
we know that Member States have adopted different approaches to charging for the issue of permits under Directive 96 / 61 / EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control .
the authorities responsible for issuing permits incur costs , and each Member State is able to decide how it wants to finance those costs .
the Commission does not therefore have any estimates of the total level of administrative charges imposed on CO2 emitters .
I would also like to say that I am standing in for Mr Dimas , who sends his apologies because he is attending the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change .
as you know , it is a very important conference and he has asked me to stand in for him .
thank you , Commissioner .
would you not agree , though , that differing administrative charges considerably distort the internal market , and that this leads to varying competition conditions in individual Member States ?
would you also agree that , in certain Member States , the administrative charges are significantly higher than the administrative expenditure actually incurred , and that it may be necessary for the Commission to make improvements here to safeguard the internal market ?
. these charges may vary between Member States and be absent in some cases .
but this is no different from other taxes and charges that vary between Member States and have implications for companies .
in the end , it is a political decision for each Member State to take as to whether it wants to finance administrative cuts like this through the general budget , or via direct charges .
since the question of charges for issuing greenhouse gas emission permits is not within the Commission &apos;s competence , the Commission has no overview of how much each Member State currently charges for issuing greenhouse gas emission permits under the Emissions Trading Directive .
the review of the Emissions Trading Directive will start early in 2005 .
it will be a major stakeholder survey and will cover a broad range of issues , including the effect of the scheme on the extra @-@ Community competitiveness of European companies .
Commissioner , emission trading certificates are a very important aspect of the European Union &apos;s meeting its Kyoto objectives .
it seems to me very unsatisfactory that you are not able to inform the Member of the current state of play as regards each individual Member State .
will the Commission , in moving towards a review in 2005 , survey the 25 Member States to establish what is the existing practice and ensure that a level playing field is created post @-@ 2005 ?
. as I said , the review of the emissions trading directive will start at the beginning of 2005 .
it will be a major stakeholder survey and will cover a broad range of issues .
I can forward your question to my colleagues and perhaps ask them to carry out a study so that we can compare the situation in each country .
it seems reasonable to me to have this information but I repeat that taxation and charges are not the competence of our Commission .
it is up to each Member State to decide the level of charges and taxation , as is the case for other products .
. the Commission is well aware of the problem of piracy , particularly in its most recent and exacerbated form via the Internet .
I fully share the honourable Member &apos;s view that this phenomenon is very damaging to the cultural industries and I am determined to do the utmost to get piracy levels as low as possible .
the Commission established a high @-@ level group on digital rights management systems in March 2004 , as part of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan .
the high @-@ level group &apos;s final report , presented on 8 July , reflects a consensus on basic principles and recommendations for future actions in three areas , one of which is the migration to legitimate services .
encouraging consumers to use legitimate online services is fundamental to the creation of a thriving e @-@ content market .
the digital rights management systems will play an essential part , enabling new business models and preventing unauthorised use .
recommendations included actively promoting awareness among consumers of legitimate alternative offerings and the need to create consumer confidence .
regarding the situation outside the EU borders , also addressed by the honourable Member , on 10 November 2004 the Commission adopted a strategy for the enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries .
this strategy sets the guidelines for the coming years towards a reduction of the level of intellectual property rights violations taking place beyond the EU borders .
over and above technical cooperation and assistance , enforcement , regulatory implementation and bilateral and multilateral monitoring , the Commission will foster awareness @-@ raising of users and consumers in third countries and support the creation of public @-@ private partnerships for enforcement .
there are a number of programmes that also cover intellectual property rights and include awareness and education : for example , ECAP , which is an intellectual property programme for the ASEAN countries ; the Cotonou Agreement for the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , and the CARDS programme for the countries of the Balkans .
thank you , Commissioner , for that answer .
the point is that all those measures are perfectly valid and , as you explained , deal with all the different aspects of protecting intellectual property .
the specific problem I tried to raise is whether the Commission will focus particularly on the area where Member States have fewer instruments to deal with this , showing what is behind the protection of intellectual property and raising awareness among citizens .
this is probably one of the few cases where criminal codes are violated by citizens without them knowing that they are doing so , and even thinking that it is something positive to do .
so what do you intend to do to show , through general campaigns or whatever , that this is a very important matter and that the future of the audiovisual industry in Europe is at stake ?
. the Commission will continue monitoring what is going on in individual Member States .
various Member States such as the United Kingdom , France and Germany have already put in place large @-@ scale education and awareness programmes .
the Commission does not have more resources than Member States .
it is a matter primarily for Member States to ensure that the point you have validly raised is more widely known , along with the problems that arise from unlicensed and illegal copying .
I am informed that the black market value of illegal CDs and DVDs is three times that of cannabis , and the profit margins are eight @-@ fold .
therefore it is a much more profitable activity , with lower risks of being caught and lower penalties .
it is thus in the interests of the Member States to ensure that awareness measures are in place in an effort to stop this activity .
. first of all I would like to say that the question of the seat of the European Parliament is covered by Protocol No 8 on the establishment of the seats of the institutions , specific organisations and services of the European Communities such as Europol , and is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
the question of the location of the institutions has had a very high priority and concerns a high level of decision @-@ making , relating not only to the location of our institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg , but also to Luxembourg .
this concerns a very high @-@ level political decision .
for the Commission the total cost of missions of officials to Strasbourg amounted to EUR 1.7 million in 2003 .
this includes all the costs of missions , including those of Commission officials and members of Commissioners &apos; offices .
so this is not a large amount of money .
a slightly higher amount is forecast for the future .
you asked about all the costs for the Union .
we do not have a very precise overview of all costs , but we know that for the European Parliament the costs are much higher .
according to the March 2004 report by Mr van Hulten , MEP , the total cost of having part @-@ sessions in both Brussels and Strasbourg amounts to about EUR 200 million annually .
Mr van Hulten favoured Brussels as the single seat of Parliament and he was supported by Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgetary Control .
the Commission is not in a position to judge the functioning of the European Parliament .
Madam President , Commissioner , I appreciate the difficulties with the figures because there are so many of us who have to be moved between these two seats .
it is not only a cost in terms of money but also a cost to the environment , which I think is incredibly important .
I find it extremely difficult to defend these journeys to people in Europe and Sweden when they ask questions about this issue .
we are concerned here with a lot of money , which we could spend on many other important issues within the EU .
I think this issue is important , and we should raise it as often as possible until we are able to have a single seat for our work , hopefully in Brussels .
. that is your opinion .
as I said , the location of the European institutions was decided in 1957 and it has continued to be a very high level of political decision @-@ making .
the Commission is ready to discuss all these issues .
it is very difficult to estimate the costs to the environment , but the amount of money in our budget for 2003 was EUR 1.7 million .
Madam President , Commissioner , do you agree with me that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament , that it is only by way of a concession in order to reduce bureaucracy in its cooperation with the other European institutions that it migrates to Brussels , and that its principal seat is here in Strasbourg ?
do you also agree with me that the figure of EUR 200 million that you have given for annual expenditure refers not to the extra costs , but to the total costs of running this House ?
. the location of European institutions cannot be considered only from the viewpoint of the costs involved .
this is a very important political matter .
in his report , Mr van Hulten put these costs at about EUR 200 million , most of which were incurred as a result of travel between Brussels and Strasbourg and vice versa .
I do not have more precise figures , but the overall costs of Parliament , as can been seen in the budget , are higher .
yes , Madam President , Commissioner , this question has obviously come up repeatedly since we have been in this magnificent Chamber , and I believe we would all like to have a single place of work , that is true .
we all want to cut costs , we all want to cut waste , we all want to cut pollution , but I think the question today is the location of the seat of the European Parliament .
today it is in Strasbourg , and I think France and the citizens of Strasbourg are happy to welcome it and are doing all they can to make us feel at home .
for my part , I would like to know whether a study has been carried out to find out whether there really is a difference , because any journey to Brussels or Strasbourg represents a cost , which is the same for everyone .
whether Members travel to Strasbourg or to Brussels , I do not therefore believe it is really worth making a fuss about this seat every time .
it is really a political question for our political authorities .
. this is a political question and I have no comments on it .
this was decided in 1957 .
I can assure you that the Commission has no intention of proposing any changes on this complicated matter .
. I am very happy to reply to this question , because immediately after I was designated as the Commissioner responsible for several areas , including OLAF , I was approached and asked how to go ahead with various projects and proposals on the future of OLAF , including possible management decisions .
several different options were proposed . one was to fill this post through an open competition .
I promised that I would express my opinion after the formalities were over .
the formalities were completed on 22 November and immediately after the new Commission started we made the decision to advertise this post and fill it through an open competition .
today we received the final opinion of the legal services about some nuances concerning the announcement .
a few days ago I received the first version of the job description , so the post will be advertised very soon .
there will then be an open competition .
I would like to know how the new time schedule looks now , and what time has been allocated to Parliament to hear the candidates .
. the Commission realises clearly that this is a specific post and that Parliament and Council must be consulted on the appointment of the Director .
the deadline is 1 March , which is when the term expires .
if we publish it now , the competition procedure will be quite short .
I hope that at the beginning of next year we will have enough time to consult with the relevant parliamentary committee and the Council about proposed candidates .
we will try to select candidates as soon as possible and then start the consultation with Parliament .
the Commission has no intention of reducing Parliament &apos;s role in this very sensitive matter .
in the absence of the Member who put it , Question 37 lapses .
. the honourable Member &apos;s question covered two areas : firstly cultural diversity , pluralism and independence and secondly achieving a knowledge @-@ based economy .
cultural diversity is enshrined in Community law , mainly in the Amsterdam Protocol .
the second aspect is an innovation @-@ encouraging and technology @-@ welcoming strategy .
both these objectives have a vital role to play in the future EU .
Community law does not exclude the possibility of defining new media services as a public service .
however , new technologies must be embraced by all actors - both public and private - for a successful information society for all .
this means that appropriate public service obligations may be needed and imposed in the environment of these new technologies .
the Commission communication of 2001 on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting confirms that the Member States are responsible for the financing and definition of public service broadcasting .
in that communication the Commission does not exclude the possibility that certain on @-@ line activities could be performed as a public service .
thus Member States may take appropriate actions to achieve the objectives mentioned .
however , I should like to remind you that other media players - both existing operators and new entrants - have a role to play in contributing to pluralism , cultural diversity , innovation , competitiveness and consumer choice .
Madam President , thank you very much for your answer .
my question is based on the fact that there are many who would limit the opportunities for public service to operate .
limiting public service by banning the use of certain technology is just one way of doing this .
there are also those who see the new TV directive , as well as the proposed services directive , as a way of limiting public service .
how is the Commission to ensure that these directives in particular do not encroach upon the right of the Member States themselves to define what public service is and what conditions shall apply to the public service companies ?
. Madam President , there is a hierarchy of directives , and the directive concerned with television is the Television without Frontiers Directive .
the Treaty is also important , and the Amsterdam Protocol is very clear on the matter .
that is why , in order to emphasise legal certainty , the Commission published its communication on state aid to public television in 2001 , and why it expressly included the option for Member States of affording the Internet , among other things , the same treatment as public television , provided the Internet is part of the public sector and subject to the same obligations .
. Madam President , I must also say in this connection that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties , and that it has always done what is necessary to ensure compliance with the competition rules , in particular the provisions concerning State aid in the field of broadcasting .
still on this question , I would like to add that the 2001 communication on State aid to public service broadcasting clarifies the way in which the relevant rules must be applied .
it explains clearly , should there still be any need to do so , that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defining its remit , and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be .
the Commission looks only at whether the definition of the remit and the financing correspond to the reality on the ground .
the important thing in the eyes of the Commission is therefore that the remit be defined as clearly and precisely as possible , and that if a public service goes beyond its public remit it should keep separate accounts for commercial activities such as the sale of advertising space , for example .
thank you for your reply , Mrs Reding .
thank you for clarifying so precisely what we already know to be laid down in Community legislation .
the purpose of my question , Commissioner , was to try to go a little further .
in all the countries of the European Union , we often note that , in accordance with that interpretation of our rules , which you have clarified so well , there is often - shall we say - perverse behaviour that transgresses free competition .
do you believe that we could seek to produce a new formulation , a new text , which is able to bring together the public service criteria in a clearer manner ?
. the honourable Member is well aware that the Commission cannot go beyond the existing texts .
however , as talks are currently being held with the industry about a possible revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive , this is the time to put another definition on the table , if need be .
I am therefore waiting to see what the public and private sectors have to say on the matter .
I would also like to say to the honourable Member that if the private sector files a complaint for unfair competition , the Commission takes up that complaint , examines whether the public sector is right or wrong and grants or rejects the requests made .
one might mention a number of interesting authorisations which are cases in point ; for example , State aid to and to was allowed , as was aid to and other programmes of the same kind , because they were compatible with the rules .
others were amended or rejected .
we still have cases that are being examined , and you can be sure , Mr Herrero @-@ Tejedor , that the Commission tries to apply the rules every time , and to ensure that there can be free competition between a public sector and a private sector which must not be stifled .
. the honourable Member raised the issue of the provision of subtitling and audio description last year in Parliament &apos;s resolution on television without frontiers .
it is certain that digital broadcasting offers improved subtitling and audio description when compared with the analogue system .
there are already standards for these services .
I see the switchover to digital television as an opportunity for enhanced services of this type .
it is not a threat .
as I told Parliament at my hearing in September , I believe that the development of new technologies must be to the benefit of citizens and of their welfare .
that is why my services will shortly publish a call for tenders , launching a study on accessibility to digital television .
this study will focus on developing policy models in order to help Member States implement assistive services .
I would also like to say that there is no requirement in European law for broadcasters in Member States to provide subtitling and audio descriptions .
provision of assistive service is handled under the subsidiarity principle , but there are of course some areas coordinated at Community level by the Television Without Frontiers Directive .
within the framework of this directive , I have called on the contact committee to provide information on the measures taken by the Member States in order to enhance the opportunities for access of visually- and hearing @-@ impaired people to television programmes .
we are now in the process of collecting and analysing the Member States &apos; replies .
our aim is to promote best practice among regulators and industry groups and we will work with Member States to promote availability of assistive services and to foster an economically viable market for equipment that addresses accessibility needs .
the Commissioner will not be surprised that with a new Commission we raise these issues once again .
in fact , she would probably be surprised if we did not .
I accept what she says in relation to the Television without Frontiers Directive , but I would ask her to keep a very close eye on this issue .
subsidiarity is a fine thing , but she will know that the European Union has been funding conferences on subtitling for some 20 years and more , and that the actual increase in its incidence among broadcasters is very limited indeed .
will she , for example , ensure that a benchmarking process takes place so that we see a gradual increase year by year ?
can she today comment on when she will bring forward the results of the analysis that she has undertaken in relation to the contact group and in what form she will do so ; and can she give hope to blind and deaf people throughout Europe that better television services will prevail ?
. I would like to assure the honourable Member that I remember his letter of 25 November 2003 on the subject very well .
now that I am responsible not only for the Television without Frontiers Directive but also for the new media in general , I will certainly put even more weight on this question than I did before .
the answer to the honourable Member &apos;s question is that the study on the policy models will start at the beginning of 2005 and will finish roughly one year later , between the beginning and middle of 2006 .
as for the Contact Committee , its work is continuing and the results will be published on the web in early 2005 .
the Commissioner will be aware that I have been raising with her the question of the broadcasting of the English Premiership on television .
the Commissioner has replied that broadband Internet may be a possibility for broadcasting this without restriction .
if broadband Internet is to be used as a new way of providing more widespread communication , could I ask the Commissioner if she would also consider introducing provisions in the new proposals she is putting forward to ensure that broadband Internet broadcasting arrangements also include some suitable subtitling for the kind of people mentioned in the question ?
. Madam President , the Commission is obviously required to be neutral in matters of technology .
what is true for one technology must be true for another , and we must show persons who have difficulties in participating fully in the information society the same respect regardless of the technology .
in substance , therefore , it does not change anything , but in form , of course , it does , and where we are encouraging broadband technology , persons with sight or hearing problems must obviously be assisted .
incidentally , we are seeing , for example , that third @-@ generation telephones really do allow us to meet these persons &quot; needs ; they enable the hard of hearing to use the telephone by transmitting an image of the lips .
. Madam President , I would like to say to Mr Ebner that the Television without Frontiers Directive lays down the principle that television advertising and teleshopping must be kept separate from other parts of the programme by optical and acoustic means .
the Directive also states that surreptitious advertising and teleshopping are prohibited .
as I have already said in answer to previous questions , the Directive is being reviewed , and the public consultation held in 2003 allowed the various parties concerned to express their views .
some operators are in fact in favour of making the rule on advertising more flexible to take account of changing technology by allowing split screens , for example , or the marketing of equipment that would enable viewers to avoid advertising messages .
however , in 2003 there was a consensus that advertising should be clearly identified so as to avoid misleading the public .
that consultation did not identify any development in Europe of product placement advertising practices that would violate the terms of the Directive .
that is why this point was clarified in the Commission &apos;s 2003 interpretative communication on certain aspects of the provisions on televised advertising .
I am of course prepared to go over all these matters again in connection with a possible revision of the Directive , which I intend to present in 2005 .
thank you , Madam President .
I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that she will give priority to consumer protection in this case if there is to be a change of opinion in 2005 .
the fact is that existing practice has not been particularly satisfactory , with approaches having been taken that do not protect the consumer , and something must be done about that .
. Madam President , I shall , then , try to set an equally good example and to keep it brief .
consumer protection is of course high up on the agenda and we will take due account of it ; the Commission is prepared , in revising this Directive , to cooperate closely not only with the MEPs who concern themselves with consumer protection , but also with consumer protection organisations .
. the honourable Member asked if the Commissioner agrees with the adjusted interpretation of paragraph 14 of the United Kingdom Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations , 2003 , which deals with the use of location data .
since this question is related to an interpretation of national law , I would refer the honourable Member to Mr Richard Thomas , the Information Commissioner in the United Kingdom , who is responsible for enforcing these privacy and electronic communication regulations .
the regulations transpose the European directive on privacy and economic communication - the ePrivacy Directive .
as the member of the Commission responsible for this directive , I am pleased to indicate the following elements for the benefit of any national interpretation exercise .
this EU ePrivacy Directive provides that location data may be used , but only with the consent of the subscriber or user .
prior to that consent , the user or subscriber has to be informed of the types of data processed , the purpose and duration of the processing , and whether the data will be passed on to third parties for the purpose of the service .
however , the Commission is not of the view that the directive requires the user or subscriber to be informed of or consent to the location prior to every single attempt by the locator to locate him .
nevertheless , the directive requires that subscribers and users , even if they have subscribed to a location @-@ based service , be able to temporarily block the locating facility .
thank you , Commissioner .
I will take on board your comments about referring this back to the UK .
however , I want to follow this up .
under the current provisions , although permission should be sought , there are no guarantees that it will be .
if somebody can be tracked without their knowing it , that has very serious implications .
for the person being tracked , their personal security is violated ; they may be , for instance , under the threat of violence .
there is a whole range of very serious civil liberties issues here .
I urge you to take this very seriously .
I will take it up in the UK and hope that you will pursue it here .
. I would say to the honourable Member that if there were a problem of that sort , or if information were not made available to the consumers , then making a complaint to the national responsible body would be the right thing to do .
. Madam President , the European Commission is of course extremely concerned at the many human rights violations , including mass rapes , taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo in consequence of a long period of conflict .
the Commission has in fact made support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic transition part of its 2003 @-@ 2007 strategy for cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo .
this support is a differentiated and complementary response to the problem of mass rapes in that country .
Community cooperation experience in the health sector goes back a long way , with EUR 70 million having been spent on support programmes since 1992 .
these programmes encourage access to basic health care and the supply of medicines at prices appropriate to the situation on the ground .
a new health support programme amounting to around EUR 70 million will be put in place to consolidate what has been achieved by the earlier programmes , and to extend their activities to other areas relating to health .
in its global plan for 2005 , ECHO confirms its support for areas with a high incidence of sexual violence , in particular in the Kivus and Maniema .
projects designed to restore the rule of law and promote women &apos;s rights are also being funded by the European initiative for democracy and human rights .
the Commission is also very active in the field of institutional support .
since the beginning of this year it has in fact been assisting the Bunia court of first instance in Ituri , which deals with cases of rape .
the purpose of this support is to combat impunity and to pacify the region .
on a more structural level , the Commission is putting in place a mechanism for partnership and support for the Congolese Government with a view to reforming the justice system .
this will ultimately enable the national courts to deal effectively with cases involving actions for rape .
finally , envelope B , to which the honourable Member refers in his question , is providing around EUR 27 million for urgent rehabilitation work in Congo &apos;s eastern provinces , which are the most seriously affected by the conflict and hence by human rights violations .
Madam President , grateful though I am to the Commissioner for his detailed reply , I still have the feeling that we are fighting a running battle in some ways .
only a few weeks ago , the Presidents of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo concluded a new peace agreement , only to be at each other &apos;s throats again a few days later .
my own sources in that country - a number of Catholic priests - have reported to me that there have been many gang rapes .
once again , thousands to tens of thousands of women have been raped .
the Commission is indeed funding a programme in the region , but should we not look into the real roots of the conflict ?
we all know that there are massive gains to be made from the mineral resources - diamonds , coltan and gold .
together with the Council and its presidency , should the Commission not be taking action about this ?
this has been going on for years .
I do indeed believe , Commissioner , that everyone expects you , with your personal dedication and your personal knowledge of the region , together with your colleague , Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner , to have a stronger and more effective presence in that region , and I should like to hear your view on this .
. Madam President , I very much agree with the honourable Member .
as you well know , I am very sensitive to and very concerned at the situation in the Great Lakes countries and , more especially , by what is happening in eastern Congo .
that is why , when I leave you tomorrow morning , I shall be flying out there to make a repeat visit to all those countries and to review the situation with their leaders .
I am also aware of the renewed abuses and renewed and extremely serious acts of violence that the region is again witnessing .
the problem is not only the ex @-@ FAR / Interahamwe , there are also groups of what are really organised criminals and others who are really living off the backs of the population and are behind what can only be described as atrocities .
I shall therefore be touring the capitals between 15 and 20 December .
I shall be meeting with those countries &quot; presidents and various people in positions of responsibility , including United Nations officials , to see what the international community can really do and , in particular , what the international community is in the end prepared to do .
we are well aware that the problem will not be solved by the Congolese army and police .
they are not , at this present time , in a position to do so and it would be better to give the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( MONUC ) another mandate : it needs more resources in terms of ability to act on the ground .
as you are also aware , its present mandate does not allow it to disarm people by force , for example , but only to collect weapons from those who are willing to hand them over .
there is therefore a principle of voluntarism involved and I shall be trying to convince the people with whom I have talks .
first of all , I am going to try and persuade the Rwandans and the Congolese to keep calm and not to act in haste and risk reopening a conflict when the transition process is in full swing .
I am therefore first going to try to convince them of the necessity of preserving the transition process .
then I shall be doing my utmost to persuade the international community , which is represented in the country by bodies like the United Nations , of the need to take the necessary decisions to settle this matter once and for all , because , as you so rightly said , the rule of law is no longer truly a reality in that part of the world .
having said that , the proof that I am in total agreement with you is that I am leaving to tour the area again tomorrow , and to take stock of the situation on the ground .
there is the question of elections in Congo , of the timetable for those elections , and the legislation that still has to be passed by the parliament for those elections to be held .
you are aware , since I have already said so publicly , that I believe the election timetable should be left unchanged so as to keep up the pressure on the authorities .
I am also going to argue in Kigali that there should be no incursions of Kigali troops into foreign territory .
as you see , I am therefore planning to make another complete review of the situation .
unfortunately , Mr Staes , it is beyond my power to resolve the problem myself , and I can only hope that my powers of persuasion will have an effect this time .
at any rate , believe me , I shall be voicing your concerns because they are my own .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , over the last few decades , humanitarian aid workers have operated in insecure and unpredictable conditions .
I am sure we are all aware that the risks they run in order to provide aid in unstable situations have increased considerably .
take the examples of Iraq , Côte d &apos;Ivoire and Darfur in particular .
relief workers have very often , too often in fact , come under attack from the armed forces and militias .
given the difficult conditions in which the Commission , through ECHO , the Humanitarian Aid Office , and its partners , is working , it is becoming increasingly difficult to get material aid and assistance to those who are suffering .
it also has to be said that the growing involvement in humanitarian activities of players who are not strictly humanitarian , such as the military , has sometimes resulted in roles becoming confused , with the consequent risks for the safety of relief workers .
in order to preserve the existence of a humanitarian space and , consequently , to ensure that aid and equipment reaches the victims , the Commission &apos;s decisions are based on humanitarian values and principles and on a desire to provide quality assistance through its partnership with humanitarian organisations .
in accordance with the Council &apos;s rules on humanitarian aid , the Commission &apos;s decisions are therefore dictated solely by basic humanitarian needs and principles , namely neutrality , impartiality and independence .
observance of these principles should help to protect relief workers and give them access to victims in cases of conflict .
in order to maintain the distinction between the roles of the military and of relief workers , the Commission supports the key role of civilian organisations when implementing humanitarian measures in situations where military capacity and resources are used .
to do so , it maintains that such recourse must comply with the guidelines for the use of army and civil defence resources in complex emergency humanitarian aid operations conducted by the United Nations .
ECHO is not an operational organisation .
its task is to finance the coordinated provision of humanitarian aid through partner organisations , for example international NGOs , other international organisations or the United Nations .
the quality and effectiveness of ECHO &apos;s aid depend very much on its partners &quot; professional abilities .
all organisations signing the partnership agreement by virtue of which they work with ECHO therefore commit themselves to upholding the fundamental humanitarian values and principles I have just mentioned .
the basic objective of humanitarian aid is neither to prevent nor to resolve conflicts , but to alleviate the human suffering they cause .
in consultation with other sponsors and partners , ECHO is actively looking for ways of tackling the growing problems of access to victims and the safety of relief workers , with the aim of improving the situation in that regard .
governments , armed forces and non @-@ state players need to be made more aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law .
that law states that the parties to a conflict must facilitate the passage of aid convoys and the provision of neutral assistance to civilians affected by a conflict .
to give a real @-@ life example of this principle , when I went to Sudan , to Darfur to be more precise , I reminded the government authorities and the rebels that it was absolutely essential that they allow international humanitarian organisations free access to the victims and the people in need of help .
that is a fundamental principle and , in quoting that example , I am also stressing the importance of the political dialogue between the Commission and those countries &quot; authorities .
- Madam President , I should like to thank Commissioner Louis Michel for being so very analytical on this entire , highly important issue , especially when , very recently in the Ivory Coast , there have also been forces belonging to a country of the European Union .
however , my question is a supplementary question : has your Commission thought of cutting humanitarian aid when it is not clear or certain that it will be used by those in need and there is a possibility of its ending up in the hands of the rebels ?
I raise this in the light of the civil wars which go on for years and make it impossible to get this financial and material aid to civilians , especially medical and pharmaceutical aid for young children and the elderly .
. if it is absolutely certain that the aid will not get through , it goes without saying that we ask for it to be cut off .
having said that , I admit that it is extremely difficult because we need real @-@ time information .
we generally get that information from the operators on the ground , either NGOs or international organisations , etc .
that all happens in extremely tricky and extremely sensitive circumstances .
we therefore have to carry out a proper analysis before cutting off humanitarian aid or stopping sending or trying to send it .
you mention Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
we also have to avoid throwing the population into disarray and total destitution if humanitarian aid is cut off .
obviously , each case is assessed individually on the basis of information from our own delegations .
I have to say that the high level of decentralisation we have today helps a lot .
information reaches us more reliably and more quickly , and on the basis of that information we can either continue our work , negotiate to try and get the aid where it is needed , or quite simply break it off .
but I could not give my backing to any action that did not take all these things into account .
I nevertheless repeat that all this is extremely difficult , extremely delicate and extremely fragile and , we therefore have to look at each case individually every time .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in all fields of activity the Commission is constantly stepping up protection for the European Union &apos;s financial interests , especially the prevention of fraud .
development aid is no exception , and it should be noted that the Court of Auditors has given a positive statement of assurance concerning the management of the European Development Fund for 2003 .
as the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed , the risks relate not to the regularity of the transactions managed by the delegation &apos;s services but very often to the transactions managed by the implementing agencies , be they local associations in the developing countries , non @-@ governmental organisations or project management structures .
that is why , in 2003 , the Commission adopted a much more rigorous approach involving procedural simplification and external audit , so that such transactions can be monitored better .
so far as the part played by national interests in development aid is concerned , tendering procedures are the best guarantee of transparency and competition , and therefore also of reasonable prices .
moreover , the European Union &apos;s development policy is defined by the Council and Commission joint declaration of November 2000 and by partnership agreements with different regions and countries , such as the Cotonou Agreement , and , finally , by international commitments like the Millennium Declaration or the Monterrey Consensus , for example .
that is the framework for the European Union &apos;s development policy , and there is no question of any Member State &apos;s specific national interests .
on the contrary , that is the comparative advantage of a development policy conducted by the Community : it represents European values , principles and objectives , it is perceived by our partners to be neutral with respect to national policies and it is based on a genuine concept of partnership with those countries which is genuinely implemented .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to have practical proposals for measures .
recently , OLAF revealed that economic aid for Lesotho did not get through and that the resources were thus not used for the purpose intended .
I want to hear more practical proposals from the Commissioner .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , forgive me , but it seems to me that the mechanisms being used at the moment are sufficient .
the proof is that you refer to a case that was in fact brought to our notice by our delegation .
I think , therefore , that all the necessary procedures were set in motion immediately ; complaints were lodged , etc .
the whole mechanism responded as it should .
of course , everything possible should be done to prevent fraud .
but everything must also be done to prevent our entire system grinding to a halt in the process .
I think the controls we have today are adequate and the financial rules are sufficiently precise and restrictive .
I do not question them .
obviously we are in favour , I am in favour , of zero tolerance , but , if you will forgive me , there is , on the other hand , no such thing as zero risk .
neither can we keep on increasing the number of controls , evaluations and audits over and over again , only to find in the end that no more projects are being implemented .
both humanitarian and development emergencies arise .
you ask me for concrete measures , but you know what measures are deployed and , on the basis of the information I have , I am not in favour of creating additional measures .
the OLAF mechanism is completely independent and works well .
our delegations on the ground send back extremely important information , and even if we only have mere rumours , a rapid alert mechanism is put in place immediately .
I think it would be difficult to do more .
what we could still do , if you want a concrete measure , would be to keep our delegations well informed and to train them well , so that they are able to respond very quickly , be on constant alert and make the most of any information they may receive .
there you are ; I am of course willing to discuss the matter and to revise my opinion , but I think there are already enough controls , especially so far as my portfolio is concerned .
all these controls , evaluations , audits and obstacle courses seem to me to be amply sufficient and I am therefore rather reluctant to invent anything else .
.
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in political terms the year 2003 in Mauritania was marked by two major events .
the first was an attempted on 8 and 9 June , and the second was the presidential election of 7 November , which saw the re @-@ election of the incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid &apos;Ahmed Taya , who has been in power since 1984 .
this latest presidential election was preceded and followed by arrests , most probably somewhat arbitrary , of leading political figures .
given the restrictions on the exercise of civil liberties in the context of the war on terrorism , and the measures taken in the aftermath of the attempted , 2003 may be regarded as a year of regression on the democracy front .
the deterioration does not seem to have gathered pace in 2004 .
nevertheless , Mauritania remains a country where dialogue is possible among the various components of the power structure , even if that dialogue is invariably fraught with tension .
the Commission is aware of the fragility of this situation .
this is why , in the ninth European Development Fund , an amount of EUR ten million , or in other words 10 % of the total appropriation , was allocated to the tasks of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law .
the Commission considers it essential , of course , to remain vigilant .
it seems to me , however , that the setback in the democratisation process does not yet warrant a vigorous initiative to secure a negotiated solution to the Mauritanian crisis .
let me add that the Mauritanian Government was informed that its allocation under the ninth EDF was to be reduced by EUR ten million , chiefly to take account of inadequate sectoral performance in those very areas of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law , as identified in 2004 &quot; s mid @-@ term review .
although the reduction in funding has more to do with absorption capacity than with the political situation , it should signal to the Mauritanian authorities how imperative it is to bolster the rule of law .
in any case , the European Union is conducting an intensified political dialogue with the Mauritanian authorities , and is keeping a very close eye on developments .
moreover , I shall be making personal contact with the President &apos;s office and with a number of our connections in Mauritania to discuss the situation .
the primary purpose of this dialogue is to promote good political and economic governance .
to this end , it seeks to support the pursuit of the democratisation process that began with the elections in 2001 by highlighting the need to respect the rule of law and its instruments .
to sum up my reply to your question , I do not think there are sufficient grounds for embarking in the immediate future on a vigorous initiative designed to secure a negotiated solution to the crisis in Mauritania .
this does not appear to be justified at the present time .
thank you , Commissioner , for your reply , which shows that you recognise how the situation deteriorated in 2003 and acknowledge that Mauritania has indeed been in crisis .
it is true that few people know much about Mauritania .
indeed , it is virtually a forgotten country .
we are not too sure whether it will be part of the Cotonou Agreements with the ACP countries , or whether it will enter into the Euro @-@ Mediterranean framework .
ultimately , now that the European Union is one of Mauritania &apos;s main donors , we should like to know whether the country will depend on ACP funding or on the new delegation that has been created .
on the same subject , may I ask you to provide for closer monitoring .
in fact , in the light of current events , and if we focus only on what has been allocated to Mauritania in the fisheries sector , we must conclude that proper monitoring and control are desirable and that we ought to be able to ensure that this control is exercised .
. I naturally share your concern .
the problem that existed in 2003 has certainly not become any more acute in 2004 .
I can only promise to ensure that the political dialogue with the authorities will be quickly relaunched , and that it will focus on the concerns which you have clearly expressed and which I share .
in the coming weeks , at the beginning of the new year , I shall establish more regular contact with the authorities - whom I know well , incidentally .
indeed , in my previous life as a Foreign Minister , I visited Mauritania and was struck by the fact that , although the majority of its population are Muslims , Mauritania is one of the only Muslim countries that maintains relations with Israel and therefore tries to be even @-@ handed .
I admired Mauritania for that , because the ability of a Muslim country to adopt an even @-@ handed approach to a conflict such as that in the Middle East seemed to me to indicate intelligence and a desire to avoid exposing the country &apos;s political life to fundamentalism or excesses of any kind .
for this reason , I do not think I shall have any difficulty in relaunching this political dialogue .
you can certainly count on me to relaunch it at the start of the new year .
thank you , Commissioner .
questions 48 to 87 will be answered in writing .
the debate will now resume , with a continuation of the discussion on the preparation of the next Financial Perspective .
Mr Silva Peneda has the floor for two minutes .
Mr President , Mrs Grybauskaitė , a seven @-@ year period is a long time in the world in which we live .
since the last Financial Perspectives , the EU has undertaken the biggest enlargement in its history and has become even more integrated with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and the signing of the Constitutional Treaty .
in the last seven years , the world has become more globalised and societies have become more complex and diversified .
attitudes , customs , behaviour and even values have changed .
the Financial Perspectives must therefore be adaptable to the current political context and to the new realities of the world in which we live .
with the decision on the Financial Perspectives , we have a unique opportunity to show that we have a more ambitious vision for Europe , a winning vision , which I think is shared by the Commission .
we must therefore prevent , at all costs , any lowering of the objectives of the Financial Perspectives or any simple act of budgetary consolidation , which some people would appear to want .
in this context , I should like to ask Mrs Grybauskaitė kindly to comment on the three essential prerequisites on which , to my mind , the Financial Perspectives ought to be based .
the first of these is credibility .
the political priorities of stepping up the competitiveness of both the economy and European cohesion must go hand in hand .
secondly , there must be a clear break from previous practices , by which I mean we need to set about reforming the EU &apos;s own resources .
thirdly , imaginative solutions must be created , such as ensuring that funds earmarked in the EU &apos;s budgets also act as a tool for mobilising other financial sector resources , be they from the public or private sector .
Mr President , the new financial framework will be the first following EU enlargement .
it must be possible for it to be adopted by everyone , both new and old Member States .
this also applies to states that are quite well off .
in northern Europe , onerous special conditions apply that have not disappeared .
it cannot be fair to allow permanently disadvantaged areas , for example those with cold climates and long distances , to pay , as it were , for the fact that , statistically , they appear to be rich .
there is also an expectation that certain projects not directly linked to the EU budget are to be turned into a reality .
in the Baltic region , for example , there is universal support for improving water quality in the Baltic .
this means , among other things , that it needs to be possible for all waste water , including that from Saint Petersburg , to be cleaned .
the research priorities must support development of whole regions that have lived apart for historical reasons , such as the Baltic region and Central Europe .
finally , I would state that there are high expectations of greater clarity in the EU &apos;s foreign policy .
we face challenges in Ukraine , Caucasus , Belarus and perhaps also Russia .
Mr President , I would like to return to this afternoon &apos;s debate .
it is a great pity that the Council is not present now to listen to our debate on the problems we face with the Financial Perspective , for , speaking as a regional politician - and as one who works in this House &apos;s Committee on Regional Development - it is clear to me that we need the security to plan ahead .
that means that we need agreement , and need it very soon , as 2005 is the final deadline if the planning stage is not to prove insufficient for the local authorities .
what that also means is that the loss is borne by the local stakeholders who want to get involved in planning , because the planning rules will be implemented at this level far too late .
I also endorse what the Commissioner said about it making sense , in this first year with ten new Member States , to extend the period to seven years , in order to have a long planning stage where the Structural Funds are concerned .
that makes sense in practical terms .
I also want to stress that the Structural Funds must not be turned into a piggy bank , for cohesion is at the heart of the European Union .
in the country I know best , this throws up contradictions when politicians appeal to the masses with speeches about the 1 % issue , only then to go to Brussels and ask for money to sort out the structural problems in their region .
we want a truly European policy , and that is not it !
Mr President , on the future of European Parliament funding and financing , I accept that it is very important that the Commission and the Council of Ministers , and indeed Parliament , try after the first seven years to think about rationalising during the five years of Parliament &apos;s term .
we have the advantage of a fixed term , we ought to use that for future financial perspective periods .
I very much agreed this afternoon with Mr van den Berg when he said that we must do something in the nation @-@ states to tighten up on accountability .
that leads me on to our philosophy in the British Conservative group , which is that we should try to do what we can in Europe and do it effectively and efficiently .
if that means doing less , then let us do it better .
too often we try to increase the powers in Europe and increase our coverage of all sorts of items .
that does not just cost money , it leads to further dilution of concentration , of accountability , and that is extremely important .
the other point I wish to raise is about own resources .
we need to consider the method of own resources .
we have a perfectly acceptable method that works quite well and we should not make fundamental changes to it .
I would not ever like to see the imposition of a European Union tax , which has been thought about for the period from 2013 onwards .
that would be a retrograde step .
we need to have a Council of Ministers that is all @-@ powerful in my book , even speaking as an MEP .
basically it pays the bills , and that is fine by me , provided we can control what we are doing and provide proper accountability in future .
Mr President , this question of the European Union &apos;s financial framework is crucial .
it is crucial because the European Union must rise to formidable challenges : bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion , achieving the aim of cohesion , the symbol of our policy of solidarity , without forgetting the less favoured regions of the old Union of 15 , meeting commitments under the common agricultural policy and Natura 2000 and , above all , achieving the Lisbon objectives in the realms of competitiveness , research , employment , training , environmental policy and public health while giving due consideration to the ageing of our population .
this last point has not been addressed this afternoon , even though an ageing population clearly has economic and social implications for our future .
faced by these challenges and by the explosive growth in Chinese competition , how does the Commission intend to position itself ?
at a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the gates of Europe once again , can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 1990s , even though the European Union has subsequently taken on many new Member States and been accorded wider powers under a series of new treaties ?
Mrs Grybauskaitė , we are not reassured .
questions need to be asked about the Commission &apos;s desire to make tangible proposals .
arm yourself with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one @-@ per @-@ centers , to bring home to them , as Mr Barroso said , that more Europe cannot be achieved without more money .
even allowing for the agreement on the CAP , we already know that it will be impossible to fund the Union &apos;s regional policy between now and 2013 if we adhere to the one @-@ per @-@ cent ceiling .
Europe is on the move ; it has been enlarged , it is ambitious , but are you sure , Mrs Grybauskaitė , that you have the means to fulfil its ambition ?
what we are asking you to do is tell us what resources are needed to finance our objectives .
and you know that they will have to be increased .
be prepared , Commissioner , to defend the key positions vigorously .
you must be aware that this would be a bad time to disappoint not only Parliament , but all the people of Europe too .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start what I have to say by pleading for greater seriousness and a more objective approach .
in our debate this morning on the 2005 Budget , a very large number of speakers appealed to the Council to take the Budget more seriously .
if , though , we aim to achieve an agreement with the Council at a time when we are already talking in terms of a motion on Budget shortfall , then the figures we have agreed are not credible , and many already suspect that we may well not be able to manage on them .
reading the media over the past few days on the subject of the Financial Perspective , I begin to fear the same thing .
I also fear a similar lack of seriousness when it comes to the debate on Turkey and other current issues , and I ask you , Commissioner , not to be a spectator , but to be more politically pro @-@ active .
the Budget and the Financial Perspective are work programmes in the form of figures , and today we have started to discuss the policy programme for the next five years .
what we demand is greater competitiveness ; Lisbon and Barcelona are the top priorities and must be implemented just as much as an enhanced role in the world for young people , the fight against terrorism , enlargement through the addition of Croatia , Bulgaria and Romania , a new neighbourhood policy and improved information and communications policies .
what I would like you to tell us is whether all the things we have been debating today with regard to additional responsibilities and measures are actually contained in the old Commission &apos;s proposal , or whether the new Commission has to put its stamp upon it and demand political projects ?
up to now , it has only been whispered behind the scenes that there are constant discussions about the upper limit .
let us put a stop to playing games with numbers and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost , and then we will be able to talk about own resources and the allocation of tasks and about who has to do what .
- Mr President , I should like to make three comments on the issue which we are debating .
first , I welcome the fact that nearly all the honourable Members who have spoken considered that the European Union budget should be commensurate with the ambitions tabled from time to time by both the Commission and Parliament , because it is a fact that policy without money is not possible .
what I find particularly negative is the fact that the size of the budget is being discussed and there are tendencies to make cutbacks at a time when , even if the Commission proposal were accepted , this would be the equivalent of the European Union &apos;s spending a total of 2.5 % of all annual public expenditure in Europe , because that is what we are talking about at a time when we have ambitions , as I said , for important and serious things .
secondly , I should like a clarification on the part of the Commissioner as to what is going to happen in connection with the future of the Structural Funds if no decision is taken by the end of this year , because there is a multiannual aspect to Structural Fund policies , there is the problem of creating what may be a legal lacuna , which will prevent the programmes from starting on 1 January 2007 .
how could this be addressed , Commissioner ?
the third issue on which I wish to comment concerns the cost of enlargement , given that enlargement comes at a price which we have to pay , because it is a major historic choice of the European Union ; on the other hand , however , this price needs to be distributed fairly .
I know that , from a technical point of view , this issue does not come under the issue we are discussing now , but it is tangential to the general issue and I should like the Commissioner to tell me if the Commission has at its disposal studies which show how the cost of enlargement will ultimately be distributed .
I refer to the question of own resources , Commissioner , but I think that these issues are directly connected .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , work on the new Financial Perspective is being undertaken in very difficult circumstances , and has therefore given rise to much controversy .
not all the issues under consideration are being discussed .
this may have been the case in the past , but it has come as a surprise to some of the new entrants to the Union .
the first point I would like to make is that the proposal to limit the budget to 1 % is not inspired by the wish to economise , nor does it stem from a desire to rationalise expenditure .
it is the consequence of the plan to change the allocation of financial resources and the view that the latter can be utilised more effectively in national policies .
what we are therefore witnessing is a reduction of the scope of Community policies .
this does not come as a surprise to advocates of a coordinating Union , but it is cause for alarm amongst advocates of a strong Union .
restricting income and expenditure impacts directly on all countries , because it requires changes to the structure of financing cohesion policy and restricting its scope .
naturally , the weakest countries are the most affected , when they ought to be the main beneficiaries of this policy .
my second point is that cohesion policy is being reinterpreted before our very eyes .
this policy is becoming increasingly detached from its base , namely the principle of sharing the problems of under @-@ development in the spirit of solidarity , and responding jointly also to the pronounced inequalities which are the inevitable consequence of economic integration .
it is therefore essential to support the efforts made in the Council of the European Union by those governments radically opposed to amendment of the relevant provisions and deletion of the principle of supporting the less @-@ developed countries .
an example from the sporting world comes to mind .
ladies and gentlemen , imagine a situation in which a number of players are recruited to join a football team .
they are eager to play , prepared to undergo a demanding training period , and full of fighting spirit and the desire to win .
now imagine that when they make it onto the football pitch they are informed that the rules have changed and that they will be required to play rugby instead .
I am sure you will understand that in such a case the players would be unpleasantly surprised and taken aback .
it is to be hoped that the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will act consistently to ensure that the rules remain unchanged .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is in my capacity as a representative of the largest new Member State , Poland , that I take the floor in today &apos;s Question Time to the Commission on the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
I am emphasising this as most of the honourable Members who have taken the floor in this debate hail from the old Fifteen , and their views on the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 are very much at variance with those held by the new Member States .
the first problem I would like to highlight is the size of the budget for the period in question .
the six so @-@ called net contributors argue for 1 % of GDP , whereas the Prodi Commission proposed 1.14 % of GDP .
according to estimates , in absolute terms this amounts to a difference of about EUR 180 billion , which means around EUR 25 billion less for each year of this Financial Perspective .
this is an enormous sum from the point of view of the new Member States .
it is a sum that is absolutely essential to reduce the differences in development between old and new Member States , and to ensure that the division into a first and second class Europe does not become permanently entrenched .
the second problem I should like to refer to concerns the resources for Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund .
I refer in particular to their allocation to regions in the old Union affected by the &apos; statistical effect . &quot;
the Commission is showing remarkable generosity towards these regions . there are plans to allocate no less than EUR 194 billion to them over these next seven years , but only EUR 181 billion to regions in the new Union .
it should be borne in mind that this period will see the accession of at least two new Member States , and that the whole of the territory of the 12 new countries is eligible for support .
the third problem I wish to mention concerns limiting resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to 4 % of the GDP of the Member State in question .
for the ten new Member States this means an annual total of less than EUR 20 billion .
I believe it would be appropriate to raise the threshold to at least 5 % of the GDP of the Member State .
I very much hope the Commissioner will take the three concerns I mentioned into account .
Mr President , let me raise a few issues from the perspective of a new Member State .
first , the new financial framework should be driven by the political priorities of the enlarged Union and the principle of solidarity among the Member States .
second , the own @-@ resources ceiling should be established at a level that would assure the successful integration of the new Member States in the Union and take account of commitments entered into during the accession negotiations .
third , it is my firm belief that we , the European Parliament , have to support high allocations for the Lisbon strategy measures from the Commission &apos;s budget .
a clear mechanism securing a certain share of funds for each Member State should be designed for funding this priority .
I should also like to point out that the funding of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should not be at the expense of EU cohesion policy .
the assistance planned for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should add to , rather than replace , the assistance under the cohesion policy , as competitiveness and cohesion are mutually reinforcing .
fourth , from the point of view of less @-@ developed economies in the EU , the level of financial assistance should be proportional to countries &apos; current economic level of development .
in any case the assistance rate per capita should not be higher in the more prosperous Member States than in the less @-@ developed ones .
fifth , we should also consider that the limitation of structural assistance through the capping rule , if it is applied in the next programming period , could , in some cases , slow down the social and economic convergence of the least @-@ developed Member States , by directing cohesion policy resources to more developed Member States and regions .
last but not least , the Commission rightly pointed out that an enlarged EU requires more money .
it is impossible to overcome the challenges of an enlarged and ever @-@ enlarging Europe with less money .
Mr President , it is important that we be given the opportunity of discussing the financial framework in good time and of voting on it in the parliamentary committees at regular intervals .
that is particularly true in the case of cohesion policy and regional policy .
in the past , in fact , regional policy has been extremely effective .
the disparities in Europe have levelled out to a large extent , and , in the light of new key initiatives , especially the Lisbon agenda , this policy should certainly be continued .
this can only be done , however , if this Parliament , in consultation with the Commission and the Council , lays down the new regulations in good time .
in concrete terms , this means that by the middle of next year , mid @-@ 2005 , we should be able to take a decision on this , failing which we will have a repeat of what happened in 1999 when the debates were too lengthy and implementation had to be cut short .
the Lisbon agenda requires perseverance on the part of the national governments and of those involved in the regions .
this means that we must be ready in time , and , from that point of view , carrying the whole thing over to the second half of 2006 , under the British Presidency , would be detrimental to the policy .
in short , I should like to emphasise the importance of regional policy in the context of the Lisbon objectives , innovation , promotion of competition and the new second budget objective , partly because this can promote cooperation in regions and cooperation between partners .
let me say , turning to the financial perspectives , that the 1 % does , of course , make them impossible .
another factor that plays a role in this is that we have learned that implementation was closer to the people in a decentralised setting in conjunction with provinces , regions , cities , social partners in the regions in Europe , and greater involvement was the result .
if 1 % were to culminate in a renationalisation of policy , we would miss the European added value , and I would find that very regrettable .
thank you very much .
that brings us to the end of the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not intend to take the floor .
the debate is therefore closed .
we feel that the Commission &apos;s proposal for the next Financial Perspectives is clearly not sufficient to address the current social , economic and environmental challenges , the need for economic and social cohesion - which has increased with enlargement - and the high levels of unemployment and poverty in the EU .
quantitatively , what is being proposed is actually an average of 1.09 % of Community GNI , which is less than Agenda 2000 ( 1.10 % ) and previous benchmarks ; qualitatively , the priorities are &apos; competitiveness , &quot; &apos; entrepreneurial spirit &quot; and &apos; security and defence &quot; at the expense of development , cooperation and cohesion .
one might ask in this debate whether Barroso reinforces and exacerbates Prodi , given that statements from Commissioners pave the way towards negotiating , or renegotiating , below the already inadequate package , in line with the signatories of the &apos; Letter of the six , &quot; who intend to impose a ceiling of 1 % of Community GNI on the budget , something to which we have always been opposed .
we therefore wish to make it clear that we reject the Financial Perspectives , of which the average annual spending falls between the Commission &apos;s proposal and the ceiling of the &apos; Letter of the six , &quot; which I mentioned earlier , and is moving ever closer to that ceiling .
lastly , we support the idea of retaining the seven @-@ year financial framework , given that , even in this area , the tendency is to &apos; negotiate &quot; downwards .
the next item is the report ( A6 @-@ 0051 / 2004 ) by Mrs Lambert on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin &#91; 2004 / 2121 ( INI ) &#93; .
the debate is open .
Mrs Lambert has the floor .
. Mr President , I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their interest and their commitment with regard to this report .
I am sure that we would all have liked more committee time , not least to have debated the amendments presented in committee and the overall content more thoroughly , as I am aware that certain difficulties still remain .
but there is a great deal on which the majority of us from the committee agree and I trust the Council and the Commission will remember that .
we welcome the Commission &apos;s two communications as an important step in the development of a common asylum policy .
we support the stress on measures such as the resettlement programmes , protected entry procedures and support in the region as being additional and complementary to the existing rights to seek asylum within the European Union , and agree that those internal asylum systems should be of high quality .
we agree that we do not view the outsourcing of internal EU responsibilities to camps in countries such as Libya as offering any sustainable solution , or even a short @-@ term solution , to those seeking asylum .
as regards the single procedure , we recognise that it is better both for the asylum applicant and the authorities if all relevant information is examined at one time , and we welcome the fact that the Commission has laid out a common order of decision @-@ making .
however , we also recognise the possible protection gap in those Member States that only employ full refugee status and have no practice of subsidiary protection , compared with Member States using both categories .
I recognise that this is a difficult issue for some Members and that paragraphs 37 and 38 of the report may seem to pre @-@ empt the reconsultation process on the procedures directive in which we hope Parliament will be involved very shortly .
I would welcome the views of Members on the possible loss of those paragraphs .
Parliament , however , fully agrees with the need to frontload the decision @-@ making process .
we support the need for the better use of in @-@ country information by better @-@ trained staff .
it is appalling that someone &apos;s life should depend on an opinion that was never tested for its veracity .
this is the situation facing Ramzi Isalam , a homosexual Algerian man who may be deported from the UK to Algeria as he is deemed not to be in need of subsidiary protection .
this is due to a line in a Canadian diplomat &apos;s report some years ago , which is still included in the country information the UK uses .
all the other opinions of that diplomat have been deleted over time .
the EU has to do better than that in terms of the quality of the information we use to decide on people &apos;s lives .
more controversially , the majority view in committee was that we need to have in place some form of monitoring or report @-@ back system on what happens to those who are returned having made unsuccessful claims for protection .
then we might know if it is really safe to return others .
the committee fully supports the need for a better coordinated approach to support in the region for the vast majority of the world &apos;s refugees who never even try to come to the European Union , contrary to many newspaper reports and some politicians &apos; views .
we recognise that such coordination is a challenge , but a piecemeal approach creates confusion .
we want to know how the Commission proposes to improve such coordination in future .
we also agree that we need new money , not a reallocation of existing aid budgets , to offer any long @-@ term support to help improve capacity and the quality of response in the regions of origin in full cooperation with the countries concerned .
what else do we agree on ?
we agree that resettlement programmes can be of great value , especially when they cater for those most at risk in an already precarious situation ; that these programmes can be used within the European Union to help develop a public understanding as to why refugees seek protection ; and that this understanding can help to combat all forms of discrimination , not least racism and xenophobia .
we also agree that we need a common foreign and security policy that commits the EU as a matter of priority to conflict prevention and the resolution of long @-@ term conflicts .
in that context we welcome the proposed EU regional protection programmes and wish to be involved in their development and assessment .
as you can see , there is much that we agree on and that is not in dispute in this debate .
whatever the final vote tomorrow , that is the message I would wish us to convey to both the Council and the Commission .
we agree that the Commission &apos;s dual approach - to aim for a universally high standard of application of the current directives within the EU and to improve the conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing - is a reasonable and indeed ambitious programme .
Parliament will wish to be fully involved in the development of such initiatives .
. Mr President , Mrs Lambert &apos;s report sets the two communications in the framework of achieving a common European asylum system .
in the asylum chapter of the Hague Programme the objective of a common European asylum system is fully confirmed and an ambitious deadline of 2010 is set for the realisation of that goal .
the Commission will ensure that the deadline is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task .
as of spring 2005 the European Parliament will be a co @-@ legislator in the process necessary to bring this about .
the Hague Programme also reflects the fact that the external dimension of asylum is being recognised as increasingly important in the EU .
the improvement of the global protection system is something that can benefit refugees the world over and can help to better share out the responsibilities for refugees with those countries that accommodate the greater part of the refugee population .
that is also in the EU &apos;s interest .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for recognising the importance of this work and the financial implications involved .
the full support of the European Parliament is required .
the durable solutions communication explores how the EU can enhance protection capacities in regions of origin and also help ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection through the setting @-@ up of an EU @-@ wide resettlement scheme .
refugees should be able to access protection as quickly as possible and as closely as possible to their needs .
the emphasis here is on burden sharing rather than burden shifting , on exploring with third countries how we can work together to address a common challenge .
these plans must be entirely complementary to , and not a substitute for , Member States &apos; obligations under international human rights law , and in particular the 1951 Refugee Convention and the right to asylum in the European Union .
the Hague Programme is clear that the implementation of the second phase of the common European asylum system must be based on a robust evaluation of the impact of the measures taken in Member States .
our communication indicates a methodology for taking that evaluation forward and for how practical cooperation should be developed .
that collaborative and consensus @-@ driven methodology can also be applied to other areas under the asylum and migration .
for the longer term we should encourage and promote further cooperation among Member States in this field .
that is what the Commission intends to do .
. Mr President , the key to this integrated and comprehensive approach to asylum and migration is the cooperation of third countries , which will be invited to work in partnership and share responsibility with us to ensure that this well thought @-@ out policy succeeds .
this cooperation should be sought through existing instruments , including , in particular , the European Neighbourhood Policy .
the EU must not be seen by third countries as - and here you were right , Commissioner - trying to shift its own responsibilities from our shoulders to theirs .
to this end we must demonstrate , in a visible manner , our readiness to assist these countries in enhancing their protection capacity , to be better prepared to provide urgent assistance to countries in crisis , and to ensure the necessary budgetary means other than those already envisaged as development aid .
parallel to third countries , we must be seen to be ready to assume our own responsibilities : the creation of a common European asylum system as called for at Tampere , a fully @-@ fledged regional protection programme by December 2005 , and a resettlement scheme based on the absorption capacity of individual Member States .
finally , enhancing protection capacity in creating protected entry procedures does not mean abandoning the existing right of application for asylum on spontaneous arrival in an EU Member State .
I am firmly of the belief that the more the EU succeeds in enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin and the more it assists third countries in bringing protection capacity up to standard , the more the protected entry procedures from outside the EU will be enhanced ; the fewer spontaneous asylum claims will be presented directly to Member States ; and the less lucrative the trade of trafficking in human beings will become .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since the Tampere European Council included amongst its objectives the creation of a common asylum system , Parliament - including the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats - has been fully committed to that objective and to the European Union &apos;s intention to respond to those people who come to our countries legitimately in search of better lives and a better future .
today , and with our sights set on 2010 , the date established in the Hague programme for completing the second phase of the common asylum system , we are faced with the fortunate fact that the European Union has already adopted important rules , but there is still a long way to go and we are committed to doing so .
our actions should be characterised by responsibility and rigour .
when we are talking about human beings who need our help we cannot act in any other way .
we are dealing with an important report which I believe has the fundamental merit of offering a clear and decisive view of certain issues : firstly , Parliament is saying a firm &apos; no &quot; to the proposal to create reception camps in countries outside the Union .
the responsibility I spoke about a moment ago cannot be evaded ; we cannot deal with those people looking to us to respond to their despair by looking the other way .
keeping asylum seekers outside of our borders is not the best way to demonstrate the validity of the values on which the European Union is based .
secondly , we ask that assistance for refugees be based on the principle of solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibility .
once again , we can see that only solidarity and joint action by the Union can provide viable and lasting solutions .
once again , the Union has the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to a genuinely common asylum system .
finally , we express our support for a system of resettlement at Community level , but one which always reconciles the will of the State and that of the individual in question .
for all of these reasons - although right now we have just one difficulty with the rapporteur - whose ability to reconcile positions we very much appreciate and who we thank - only if the problem separating us , with regard to so @-@ called safe third countries , is resolved , will we be able to vote in favour of this report .
Mr President , my Group supports this report wholeheartedly because we believe that a common asylum procedure is something that many across this House talk about , but the reality of actually making it happen requires support of the Lambert report .
it is difficult to go from the position of saying that we want burden sharing , a common asylum policy and to support the Tampere agenda , to the practical application of that in a report which moves forward some of the things that we want to see .
as someone who dealt with asylum cases for many years , I see the Lambert report as a progressive report , but one which can be supported across this House .
we talk about good asylum decisions .
it is a problem in every Member State that asylum decision @-@ making is so poor that we are not served well in terms of allowing genuine asylum seekers to make a case and actually enter a country .
that is bad for all of us .
poor asylum decision @-@ making is addressed in this report .
we want to step up protection capacity in regions of origin and we are defining in this report the difference between transit camps and outsourcing our responsibilities to third countries , and regional protection .
I want to register our support for this report .
.
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank Mrs Lambert for her report .
I agree with Mr Moraes .
my Group fully supports the report .
most of what I would like to say has already been mentioned by Mrs Lambert in an excellent way .
however , I should like to point out that there are tensions between the two directives .
the Qualifications Directive sets standards for refugee status and subsidiary protection .
there is a need for the directive on minimum standards on procedures to be adopted to come into line with the other directive .
that is not the case at the moment .
second , the issue of resettlement should be supported because it is aimed at the most vulnerable .
it is not another path of economic migration .
it gives hope .
at the moment only six Member States take advantage of the possibility to take refugees under resettlement schemes , but voluntary deals with the refugees will help both them and the UNHCR , which warmly supports resettlement .
finally , we should be clear that resettlement and protected entry procedures are not an excuse for cutting back on the rights of asylum @-@ seekers arriving spontaneously in the European Union Member States .
.
Mr President , over these past few years , thousands of people - men , women and children - have passed through my home town of Calais , or through the notorious Sangatte camp , having been persuaded that they will find their El Dorado in the United Kingdom : Kosovars , Afghans , Iraqis , Sudanese , Kurds - people in search of freedom and security , simple citizens of the world , driven by misery to take to the road , wishing only , like every one of us , for a bit of happiness .
allow me to assure them of our solidarity .
Europeans must know that there is a better standard of living here than in Africa and , in particular , that it is possible for people to work here illegally if they are prepared to earn less and keep quiet .
in Europe , there are those who attract , exploit and get rich by engaging in this slave trade .
yes , we need to restore the honour of Europe , which is all too often sullied , just as we must urge the Union to stop burying its head in the sand on the pretext that talking about immigration fuels nationalist sentiments .
Europe , however , must not be the sole focus of our attention in this respect . the IMF , whose recommendations are often responsible for mass emigrations , the United Nations and the office of its High Commissioner for Refugees also have a part to play .
yes , the European Union should have an asylum policy that accords with the principles of the European Human Rights Convention .
yes , the European Union should examine the emigration issue in depth .
yes , the European Union should remember that some of the children within its own territory are stricken by hunger too .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report expresses in apodictic terms a rejection in advance of any question of setting up the so @-@ called reception centres in countries of final transit proposed by several parties .
it is said that setting up such centres would lead to difficulties in complying with international human rights obligations , but I do not know on what assumptions this statement is based .
I wonder whether the rapporteur has already ascertained that the leaders of such countries or the NGOs , including the European ones , operating in the countries of origin and transit of immigrants are not willing to cooperate .
I think that this preconception is based solely on ideological grounds , since reception centres could certainly play an important role in meeting both the need to carry out the necessary controls and that of humane treatment of migrants .
in fact , the refusal to create such centres leaves the situation unchanged , and hinders the welcome involvement of countries of transit in the management of the migration process .
the centre that was recently set up in Africa , thanks to important intervention by my country through the Tripoli agreements , has already managed to prevent , at least so far , the Mediterranean crossings by desperate people in the traffickers &quot; old tubs and the resulting tragic shipwrecks .
its creation has thus made it possible to achieve a positive outcome in the fight against the despicable trafficking in human beings .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , asylum is not a technical issue .
it needs to be recognised for what it is , namely a political and social issue .
for the past few decades , the Member States of the European Union have given little thought to asylum policy , particularly regarding individuals from other continents .
the disastrous consequences of this approach are now evident .
racist and political extremism has become rife , affecting both newcomers and local people .
in addition , this inappropriate asylum policy has weakened the confidence of many societies in European integration .
rightly or wrongly , this integration is linked to an excessively liberal policy on asylum .
clearly , such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue .
the right balance must be maintained between human rights , democracy and the safety of citizen .
I am pleased to note that in the second point of its resolution , the European Parliament emphasises the need for &apos; measures to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin &#91; of potential asylum seekers &#93; . &quot;
this is entirely appropriate .
in conclusion , Mr President , I should like to emphasise that the problem of asylum is bound to increase , given the relative wealth of Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as Members of the European Parliament we sit in this Chamber representing the citizens of the 25 nations that make up the European Union .
in the Union this Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage .
in so far as we are the vehicles for direct consensus and have a mandate from the people , for certain issues we must succeed in casting off the political ideologies to which we subscribe .
immigration ought to be one of these issues .
history teaches us that the greatest misfortune for human beings is to be uprooted from their place of origin , and that immigration arises for countless reasons , not all of them voluntary .
a developed social system - and the European Union is a collection of developed states - cannot rule out some aspects of this phenomenon and focus solely on the emotive part .
the Union must safeguard the fundamental principles on which its existence is based , but it must do so in a way that benefits everyone , both its own citizens and those of third countries .
it must do so through a common policy , with choices that are mutually agreed upon and maintained , and not by means of ineffective initiatives which isolate certain Member States .
if there must be a single immigration policy , then all its consequences must be accepted , above all at times like these when there are deep concerns regarding internal security .
among other things , it is important not to rule out the organisation of an immigration information and preparation system in countries of origin and transit .
such a system should be organised and mutually agreed on and , if added to economic aid and incentives in the areas of origin , could provide positive results for all .
this proposal does not take this approach to the issue , not even in practical terms , and that is why we cannot support it unless appropriate amendments are adopted .
Mr President , I must begin by thanking our rapporteur , Mrs Lambert , for this excellent report , which has our support .
we have , in fact , reached a critical juncture in the formulation of a European asylum policy .
it is observable that the first phase of European harmonisation of national asylum policies has resulted in a levelling @-@ down of standards .
in November of this year , the Council adopted a new set of priorities for a European asylum policy in the Hague Programme .
among the provisions of this programme for the second phase of harmonisation is the development of a common asylum procedure , and our main message here is that Europe is a place of refuge and that we must preserve that humanitarian tradition .
in this context , the foremost aim of the report before us is to remind the Member States that the Geneva Convention and the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees must remain at the heart of our asylum policy .
in order to preserve Europe &apos;s humanitarian tradition , we formally reaffirm our opposition to any moves to outsource the application process and to create transit camps beyond the frontiers of the European Union .
European asylum policy must be based on the principle of solidarity , of shared burdens and responsibilities , not only inside the European Union but also with non @-@ EU countries .
a European asylum policy must also reinforce the fundamental rights of asylum seekers .
the primary aim of the single asylum procedure must be to guarantee a high level of protection for refugees .
it must also provide scope for improved decision @-@ making .
the European Parliament , democratically elected and accountable to the peoples of Europe , must affirm the right of asylum seekers to a dignified reception .
we want more accessible , fairer and better organised asylum systems , and we must rectify the defects in the present systems .
we must protect refugees , and we must also work on our own populations , explaining to them the distress that drives people to seek refuge in Europe and , by this means , fostering a better understanding of the situation .
it is , of course , desirable that refugees return to their own countries .
to that end , it will be necessary to deal with the underlying causes of their plight .
in the meantime , however , it is our duty to focus on the local integration of refugees and on their accommodation in host countries while upgrading protection capabilities and developing a programme for the development and adoption of sustainable solutions .
lastly , there seems to be a problem with the interpretation of Amendment No 1 in several languages .
let me therefore make it clear that the word &apos; based &quot; refers to the premature repatriation of refugees , not to the safeguards designed to strengthen the protection programmes .
I felt it was important to clarify that point .
Mr President , I concur with the many warm words that have been spoken by a number of Members , and I too would ask for your support for this excellent report .
we are faced with a very harrowing problem for which a solution is required as a matter of urgency .
that solution should , however , be a real and permanent one rather than a makeshift attempt .
what is really required in the long term is , of course , legal immigration in the European Union ; from that point of view , the Council has missed an opportunity by deliberately excluding legal immigration from qualified majority voting .
it would appear that the Member States find it easier to reach agreement on how to keep people outside of the EU than on how we can properly allow them in .
over the past few weeks and months , the EU and Parliament have discussed European values and human rights at great length , particularly in the debate on the Commission , but also again today in connection with Turkey .
our civilisation &apos;s standards are measured against the manner in which we deal with our fellow human beings and translate our values into practice .
asylum seekers are not criminals ; they are fellow human beings and should , accordingly , be received under humane conditions .
they deserve our support , and I , therefore , endorse this report .
the world assesses the European Union &apos;s commitment to equality , justice and fair @-@ play by the way it treats those fleeing war and persecution .
Mrs Lambert is to be strongly commended for her report and for the focus that it gives to the humanitarian and the civil rights issues which lie at the heart of the asylum debate .
I echo her call for the highest possible international standards and human rights to guide EU policy .
her rejection of the so @-@ called &apos; holding centres &apos; , even as a short @-@ term solution to the issue of dealing with asylum applicants , is to be welcomed and strongly endorsed .
the emphasis in the report on speeding up asylum requests and ensuring efficiency and transparency in the decision @-@ making process is also welcome .
conflict , poverty and socio @-@ political instability affect millions of people across the world .
we therefore need to shift the emphasis towards promoting conflict resolution and prevention under the auspices of the United Nations .
the long @-@ term solution to issues of asylum is to reduce conflict and poverty globally .
the EU has a major role to play in this regard . we must get the policy right .
we must demonstrate to the world that when it comes to human rights , justice and equality , the policy implementation of the EU is as good as its rhetoric .
I also strongly support the amendments .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I recognise myself in the Lambert report , because , if there is an enemy preventing Europe from growing , that enemy is fear .
one of the ways of combating it is certainly by knowing how to recognise those who deserve help among those who turn to us for assistance .
not long ago , 75 Eritreans were arrested by the Libyan authorities ; they had to undergo a long period of detention and were subjected to inhumane treatment .
they were then put on an aeroplane to be taken back to their country of origin .
seized by despair , they hijacked the aeroplane and forced it to land in Sudan .
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was able to interview 60 of the 75 Eritreans , since the others were in prison for the hijacking .
all those interviewed were entitled to asylum , but Libya does not have a law recognising such a right , is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and does not guarantee respect of human rights in prison .
on the other hand , even countries such as mine - Italy - do not have a law on the right to asylum , and therefore reject migrants indiscriminately , without examining applications and without fair , just and individual assessments .
even legal immigrants are humiliated and forced to wait for years for the rightful renewal of their residence permits .
it is clear that these persons are considered an enemy within , to be treated badly and thrown out .
Europe itself , though , should examine asylum applications , at the same time helping the Maghreb countries to progress along the path of respecting rights .
we should ensure that Europe , by using the highest criteria for assessing and protecting refugees , transforms these waves of people into legal immigrants , and this plan is both beneficial and possible .
for this reason it is necessary to set up a single European agency for refugees and European reception centres to examine individual requests , providing legal and linguistic assistance .
the refugees will be our foremost allies in promoting economic , civil and democratic growth in their countries of origin , since the world will be more secure only when it stops being so unfair .
thank you very much .
that concludes the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor .
the debate is therefore closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
the next item is the report ( A6 @-@ 0067 / 2004 ) by Mr Catania on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union drugs strategy ( 2005 @-@ 2012 ) &#91; 2004 / 2221 ( INI ) &#93; .
I should like to give the floor to Mr Catania , the rapporteur .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy , which is on the agenda for debate , ought to operate exclusively through a scientific approach , through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue built up over recent years .
in contrast , unfortunately , the argument is all too often permeated with ideologies and dogmatic or emotive approaches .
the data available to us allow us to take a practical approach .
I refer , in particular , to the data supplied to us by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , based in Lisbon .
as is well @-@ known , these data are not only of high scientific value but also of proven reliability .
all this unequivocally demonstrates that the strategies adopted up to now have not had positive results .
with regard to drug use in prisons , the Centre indicates that drug users are over @-@ represented in prison ; that the use of drugs among detainees ranges from 22 to 86 % , depending on the prison population , the prison and the country ; and that prisons are a high @-@ risk environment for the spread of infectious diseases .
with regard to the criminalisation of drug use , the Centre explains that in many Member States the process of criminalising the use of narcotics has led to an increase in the use of these substances .
I should point out to my Swedish fellow Members that the Centre &apos;s report contains a specific reference to the situation in Sweden , where a study is cited which shows that with the repressive strategies in force in that country the drug market has intensified ; it concludes that there is no specific proof for the argument that the criminalisation of drug use has a deterrent effect on young people .
finally , with regard to drug trafficking , Europol indicates that narcotics trafficking accounts for approximately 2 to 5 % of world GDP , which goes directly into the hands of drug traffickers and large criminal organisations worldwide .
the US drugs agency estimates that in 2005 Afghanistan will export over five thousand tons of opium , of which 95 % will end up in Europe .
this demonstrates that the action plan adopted by the UN in 1998 has not had positive results , and this is also true in terms of the importance of drugs in funding organised crime and terrorism .
a prominent prosecutor , Gerardo D &apos;Ambrosio , has explained to us that to finance the Madrid attack the Al @-@ Quaida terrorists bartered 250 kilograms of hashish for the TNT .
our report , which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking , organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to saving lives and protecting health .
the issue must not be treated as a question of public order or a matter for repression , but exclusively as a social and economic issue .
I therefore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report , on the Commission to back it and on the Council - which is unfortunately absent , having clearly already made up its mind - to consider including this recommendation on the agenda for the meeting to be held in three days &quot; time .
I would also like to mention that this recommendation was put together with the support of many organisations .
.
Mr President , Mr Catania , as you know , the new drugs strategy for the period from 2005 to 2012 that is to be endorsed by the European Council is the first anti @-@ drugs strategy for the enlarged Union .
it is based on an assessment of the previous strategy , which the Commission carried out back in October .
the European approach , which favours a balance between demand @-@ reduction and supply @-@ reduction measures , therefore covers 25 countries .
this strategy clearly addresses the need to enhance coordination within the Union as well as to raise the profile of EU efforts in other countries .
the principal aims laid down in the strategy will be translated into specific actions in the two successive four @-@ year action plans , which , as you are aware , will be proposed by the Commission at the start of 2005 and the start of 2009 respectively .
the Commission intends to adopt its proposal for an action plan in February 2005 .
it believes that Parliament &apos;s contribution in an area such as the drugs issue is essential as a means of bringing European policy closer to the people .
what we need , in other words , is a shared European political strategy .
rest assured that the Commission will not falter in its commitment to this approach .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I can inform you that the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats cannot lend its support to the draft recommendation we are discussing today , because it does not provide answers to the major challenges on which the EU should focus its future drugs strategy .
recent figures about drug use among young people are alarming .
an increasing number of young people start experimenting , and at an ever @-@ younger age , with soft drugs , in particular , which are made ever more accessible by the falling prices for them .
I believe that the rapporteur , in his report , is minimising the problem , and I see this as clearly inappropriate in this situation .
on the contrary , the situation requires a bold and comprehensive approach with only one goal in mind : that of reducing the use of drugs and all their adverse consequences .
the Commission &apos;s assessment report and the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction prove that a great deal is yet to be done , including at European level .
the European policy should , as the Commissioner stated , add value to the differentiated approach in the different Member States in terms of coordination , information , scientific research and the tackling of the cross @-@ border drugs trade and crime that goes hand in hand with that .
we believe that , if such a policy is to be adopted , a separate budget line should be created for supporting new initiatives and promoting the exchange of useful experience between the various Member States .
nothing of the sort is to be found in this report .
far from it ; it is incoherent and riddled with contradictions .
for example , it calls for an approach based on facts and scientific research - something that we can , of course , support - while , in the same breath , drawing conclusions most of which are incorrect .
it claims that repression has no benefits , and that past action has failed to bear any fruit .
moreover , it jumps to conclusions as to what should be done .
finally , the European Council will be determining the strategy this week , and Parliament ...
. Mr President , this is an excellent report which we on this side of the House support .
we support it for many of the reasons which the previous speaker mentioned , including in terms of the science and pragmatic facts of this debate .
we do not take an overtly ideological stance , but there is some ideology in the debate and the ideology says that , unless we deal with harm reduction , unless we understand addiction and unless we understand the explosion in crime which leads from drugs to the domestic crime that we suffer in all of our European Union Member States , we cannot tackle the problem efficiently and effectively .
this report - which was a much amended report with approximately 106 amendments in committee - shows two things .
one is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drugs strategy .
secondly we all know as MEPs that there is a very strong public appetite for there to be an EU strategy .
so what is that strategy to be ?
the answer to that question is very much contained in this report .
for example , in this report we talk not about being hard on drugs or soft on drugs , but about actually looking at intelligent harm @-@ reduction strategies .
we know the connections between drug use and HIV .
if we ignore those in this House , then there will be further harm , further crime and further suffering .
we want to lay much greater stress on harm reduction , but also on rehabilitation .
we want to provide appropriate funding for information measures and not to pretend that the public has sufficient information about this problem .
we also want to take appropriate steps to prevent the profits of illegal drug @-@ trafficking from being used to fund everything from international terrorism to other forms of crime .
this report is thus not &apos; hard &apos; or &apos; soft &apos; .
it is effective .
it tackles crime , as well as the harm being done to individuals .
in this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs entering prisons .
Mr Catania continually stressed this point , because it is too often ignored in Member States .
it is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issues across Member States which sometimes individual Member States are not emphasising enough .
prisons are now multiplying the effects of drug harm .
people are coming out of prisons and committing more crime .
this is a serious issue for the European Union .
there is a strong public appetite for us as MEPs and for the Commission to tackle drugs with an effective drugs strategy .
the old style of clichés and information about drugs has long gone .
we now need a more effective strategy .
this report places the right emphasis on harm reduction , tackling addiction and dealing with the source of drug problems , rather than expounding clichés about the effects .
it is a good report which we will support .
it has been much amended and I think that , in the light of those amendments , it is a report that the whole House should support .
we on this side will do so .
. Mr President , if I could cut down the use of drugs by voting against this report , I would do so immediately , but that , unfortunately , is not an option .
I therefore call on this House to support this report , for it is an excellent and courageous one .
what is its objective ?
I think we all share it .
I have also listened to Mrs Brepoels , and we have supported a large proportion of her amendments .
the objective is harm reduction , limiting the damage for the user and for the environment .
we must look into the best way of achieving this .
we must look to see which policy can produce results , because they are what matter .
this is not about ideology , but about results .
we must adopt policy that is based on fact , research and exchange of knowledge and experience , rather than on ideology .
it is therefore unfortunate that the assessment of the previous strategy was not available on time .
moreover , it was stated a moment ago that the Council would , in the next few days , be deciding to adopt this strategy after all .
it would be very regrettable if the Council were to do so without Parliament having had a say in it .
the report takes a pragmatic , realistic approach , and I have to say , in all honesty , that I have interpreted it in a completely different way from Mrs Brepoels .
I do not think at all that it rules out repression as an option .
it is , of course , the case - and that also applies to Dutch policy , which is widely misunderstood - that such repression must be specific and effective .
looking at the tough war on drugs waged by the USA , I would say that this has done nothing to reduce the use of drugs , but has only lined the pockets of the drugs barons .
crucial to our approach must be prevention and pragmatism .
I will give you a few examples that are controversial , even in the Netherlands .
everyone has difficulty accepting them , and they are not decisions to be taken lightly .
should we , for example , provide needles to drug users who live on the streets ?
are we , by doing this , condoning their use of drugs ?
no , of course not , but if we provide needles , then we know for certain that there are no dirty needles in circulation or in use .
at major house parties , where young people take all kinds of tablets , including ecstasy and that sort of thing , should we test the quality of those tablets ?
should we provide information ?
should we ensure that those young people do not mix alcohol with drugs ?
by doing this , do you give them the message that it is okay to use drugs ?
that is a risk .
on the other hand , I can see that , if this is not done , then young people die at these parties .
as long as they still use drugs , which they do , I think that prevention and information are important .
finally , we have tabled two amendments about the exchanging of information and consideration of alternative methods .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , across the world prohibitionism has always produced two results : on the one hand , a large increase in the number of deaths and imprisonments among those who use narcotics , who constitute the section of the prison population with the highest re @-@ offending rate , and on the other hand unlimited big business for all sorts of drug traffickers .
this plan , however , focuses mainly on protecting everyone &apos;s health .
this is why the harm reduction strategies are absolutely fundamental .
only by keeping alive persons who currently cannot or do not want to stop using narcotic substances can we hope that in the future they will succeed in escaping from all forms of dependence .
we must not forget that most deaths are due to AIDS and heart failures , that is , pathological situations connected with drug @-@ taking methods .
for this reason , harm reduction involves taking action on the street and at low @-@ threshold centres .
in addition , we must firmly distinguish between drug dealers and drug users , although repressive policies tend to place them in the same category .
finally , it is essential to integrate social measures and pharmacological substitution measures .
we must avoid any kind of moralistic attitude that sets these in opposition .
. Mr President , we are today discussing Mr Catania &apos;s controversial report on the European anti @-@ drug strategy , central to which is the fight against drugs rather than the promotion of them .
judging by the title of the report , we seem to be in agreement on this .
there is no place for drugs in a healthy society .
if we in the European Union are serious about tackling the drug trade , we will need to impose sanctions .
we can no longer tolerate the people who ruin lives by making money from addicts .
however , we might well have a running battle on our hands if , contrariwise , we did not do everything in our power to fight drug use .
in addition to taking preventive measures , it must still be possible to penalise the use of drugs .
on behalf of my group , I have therefore tabled two amendments enabling the continued application of sanctions in respect of drug offences , alongside preventive measures .
I urge you to support those amendments .
this , of course , does not make it a good report .
I have to get it off my chest : the report is full of ideology , despite the fact that it claims the opposite .
I will leave it here .
thank you for the opportunity of speaking my mind .
. Mr President , even though I will not be supporting the report I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
despite what he may say about the need to move away from ideology , there is an awful lot of ideology within the report .
if we have differing opinions , it will be hard for us to find the common ground that we should all strive for .
I must say at the outset that on reading the report one would believe that the criminalisation of drugs and drug use has led to an increase in the use of drugs .
one would therefore have to tacitly agree that decriminalisation would lead to a reduction in and the safer use of drugs .
the references to &apos; harm reduction &apos; methods and so on are an abuse of the English language .
it is merely facilitation .
despite what people may say and despite the good intentions that they may have , it is incorrect to say that the death rate from AIDS could be reduced through needle exchange .
a user will always use more needles and pass them on to other users .
we have to be realistic when we look at this problem .
the fact is , first and foremost , that we are dealing with people &apos;s lives - and the lives of people who are invariably some of the most vulnerable in our society .
there are claims that we would make their drug use safer by supplying shooting @-@ up kitchens , by giving them clean needles , or by the medical use of heroin - as stated in the report - and that this would make these people &apos;s lives better .
the reality is that addiction is hell , addiction destroys .
the only way to stop people from being addicts is by stopping them from using drugs .
the only way to prevent people from relapsing into addiction is to take away their need for the drug .
if you disbelieve what I say , do not bother looking at any of the so @-@ called &apos; illegal drugs &apos; .
look at the legal drugs that are available in Europe - alcohol and cigarettes - and see the damage that they cause .
Mr Moraes spoke earlier about the devastation that is caused on the streets because of drug @-@ related crime .
look at the devastation that is caused by alcohol - a legal drug - on the streets of every city in western Europe .
if we go down the road of legalisation and harm reduction , as proposed in this report , then we would see the problem exacerbated a hundredfold across all our cities .
the issue here is not about a mix @-@ and @-@ match of best policies .
the issue is about information to show people the damage and dangers that they face if they get involved in drugs .
the issue is about strong criminal penalties to ensure that those who traffic in drugs are hit where it hurts : in their pockets .
that requires asset seizures and asset freezing ; a strong policy to ensure that those who are addicts and those who fall into drug problems are given proper resources to overcome their addictions .
as somebody who has worked with young adults who are drug addicts and alcoholics , I have seen that the only way that people get off drugs is when they stop .
that should be the ultimate aim , not facilitating drug use .
Mr President , there are two genuinely opposing views in this case : one in which drugs have been accepted as a natural part of our everyday life and another in which there is a desire to do everything to stop the sale and consumption of all drugs .
most Swedes , especially parents , are in favour of the latter approach .
it means that prevention and the fight against drugs under criminal law have the highest priority .
to maintain , like Mr Catania , that current drugs policy could be a crime against human rights is quite alien to us .
we do not see the taking of illegal drugs as a human right .
penalties that enable drug addicts to choose care instead of prison are not a crime against human rights .
they are a way of helping people escape drug dependency .
the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon also points this out at the end of the introductory summary in its report , which I think Mr Catania should read .
we do not wish to decriminalise drug abuse .
instead , we wish to give clear and unambiguous signals that reject drugs .
proposals to have doctors offer people help in taking drugs or , even worse , proposals to distribute heroin are just as alien to us .
what is central as far as we are concerned is that the rehabilitation of drug addicts and the content of the care given to them should be , and remain , a national competence .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , in common with we Swedish Moderates , will vote against Mr Catania &apos;s report precisely because we take a stand in the fight against this epidemic .
our approach is directed towards releasing people from drug dependency , not seeing them hooked on drugs .
Mr President , in the sixties , rebellious and critical young people discovered the drugs that had previously been used only behind closed doors by the well @-@ heeled in society .
they saw the use of soft drugs as part of their fight for freedom .
since then , policy in a number of states has been aimed at isolating , criminalising , penalising and eliminating drug users .
this repressive approach has not prevented the use of drugs from spreading .
the alternative to this approach is not to become indifferent and consequently to resign oneself to the damage which drugs do to the health of the users and the nuisance they cause for others , as also do alcohol and nicotine .
we should not shy away from the conflict with the dealers , who make a good living from other people &apos;s problems .
in his report , my colleague , Mr Giusto Catania , has shown the right way to reduce the problems as much as possible .
he endorses the practice , developed in the Netherlands , Belgium , Switzerland and parts of Germany , of tolerance , prevention and provision of aid to users and of distinguishing between the addictive tendencies of different types of drugs .
I am aware that this approach meets with emotional objections among those who laboured under the illusion of being able to stamp out drugs by penalising the users , but that has only resulted in resistance to the lack of freedom .
that is why broad support is needed for the alternative .
Mr President , the Swedish June List is strongly critical of the report we are debating today .
according to the proposal , a genuine EU policy to combat drugs must be introduced .
a common drugs policy within the EU means a compromise policy that is liberal regarding drugs .
in Sweden , any use of drugs , except for medical reasons , is banned .
for us , it is important for Sweden &apos;s restrictive drugs policy to continue in the future too .
we recommend preventive work , treatment , social education and rehabilitation .
the report emphasises a drugs policy designed to reduce harm .
we want to work towards a drugs @-@ free society instead of accepting the use of drugs .
we object to drugs being classified as soft or hard , as well as to the assertion that so @-@ called soft drugs are not addictive .
the lack of internal border controls able to prevent the drugs trade between the Member States is a problem in this connection .
an individual EU Member State must be able to monitor its national borders in order to prevent drugs from coming into the country .
as matters now stand , internal border controls in the EU are practically non @-@ existent .
in conclusion , I would note that drug problems in the EU are in large measure a consequence of the prevailing poverty in many countries in the world .
not being informed by a sense of solidarity , EU trade policy involving duties , licences and quotas contributes to the problems of global poverty .
it is important for the UN , rather than the EU , to work towards making it profitable to cultivate alternative crops in the poor countries of the world .
Mr President , Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , the report presented to us today by Mr Catania calls into question the policy of zero tolerance and prohibition implemented by the Member States .
the rapporteur &apos;s aim is to amend the current strategy and it will be to no one &apos;s surprise that we have voted against this report
Mr Catania mentioned the report by the European drugs and drug addiction monitoring centre .
Mr Estievenart was with us last month and pointed out that , and I quote , &apos; there are positive signs that progress has been made in reducing some of the worst consequences of drug use . &quot;
he said that the number of drug @-@ related deaths has begun to fall , that heroin use has levelled off in a number of countries , that the HIV epidemic among users is slowing and , I quote , &apos; measures to reduce drug @-@ related harm are intensifying and , across much of Europe , drug users have better access to treatment and care . &quot;
this clearly demonstrates that not everything has been negative .
much remains to be done and , despite all the policies that we have been pursuing , enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs , and in terms of drug use , which continues to hit extremely high levels in all Member States .
in light of the accession of ten new Member States , it is essential that we step up cooperation with the countries that now border the EU .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is room for a European anti @-@ drugs policy that fights back against drug @-@ related crime , and that , as per the programme , meets the four main objectives of preventing drug use and dependency , reducing the supply and demand of illegal drugs , limiting social and health damage and reducing crime .
this is the path that we must follow - the path of combat , not the path of slackness .
Mr President , certain facts are straightforward , such as the fact that Europe is the world &apos;s largest market for cannabis .
is it possible to get rid of drugs ?
shall we give up and just limit the damage ?
emphatically not .
we know that it is specifically with cannabis that most people who end up mis @-@ using heroin , cocaine and amphetamines begin .
that is why it is crucial for us to ensure that fewer new cannabis users are recruited .
according to Mr Catania &apos;s report , the restrictive policy has failed .
the figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon , which was published a couple of weeks ago , is unambiguous .
in countries such as Sweden , with a restrictive view of drugs , 7 % of 15 year @-@ olds have used cannabis .
in Great Britain , 42.5 % of all 15 year @-@ old boys have used cannabis .
the restrictive policy has led to dramatic reductions specifically in the number of drug users recruited .
according to Mr Catania , &apos; soft &quot; drugs are not dangerous .
according to the Monitoring Centre &apos;s new data , there is an increased risk of a range of physical and mental problems such as depression , psychoses and schizophrenia .
a review of European drugs policy is under way right now .
in countries such as the Netherlands , too , the attitude has changed over the last ten years .
now , only a third of the country &apos;s so @-@ called coffee shops remain .
the Dutch Justice Minister has said that the Netherlands will probably be forced to alter its policy .
there are high hopes of reversing the trend .
anyone who wants to see fewer drugs in Europe should vote against Mr Catania &apos;s report .
Mr President , I would warn against the terms &apos; soft &quot; and &apos; hard &quot; drugs .
talk of soft drugs gives out completely the wrong signals .
it makes these drugs out to be harmless , but there are no soft drugs .
instead , these drugs - for example , cannabis - are often the gateway to other drugs .
I have visited many different treatment centres for drug addicts where just about all addicts have agreed that what are mistakenly called soft drugs started them off on the drug misuse that destroyed their lives and robbed them of their future .
these addicts feel angry and frustrated that society has not made the dangers of cannabis , hashish and similar drugs sufficiently clear .
in my own country , Sweden , we have combined a restrictive drugs policy and the criminalisation of drugs with care and treatment for addicts .
this combination has proved to be the best way of stopping drug abuse .
the small increase we have seen in Sweden in recent years has been due partly to the open borders and partly to the influence of the legalisation debate taking place elsewhere in the EU .
thank you very much .
that concludes the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor , so the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
I should like to give the floor to Mr Sturdy , the rapporteur .
Mr President , may I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to be here , and I hope that tomorrow when the vote is taken we will have an agreement .
I see Mr Jørgensen is here , and I want to pass some comments about the way this Parliament has worked .
Mr Jørgensen came in very late on , because he is a new Member .
my Liberal , Socialist and Green colleagues have worked very closely together on this report .
I thank them , because it left me in a position of great strength when it came to negotiating with the Council , and that is a position all of us in this august House aim for in order to be able to put our points forward .
what is this report about ?
the idea was to put in place a central harmonised system for the control of certain types of chemicals and fix levels of MRLs - maximum residue levels - of chemicals in foodstuffs .
the one thing that has not escaped me , but may well have escaped other Members , is that this is a forerunner of the REACH Directive , which will be one of the biggest reports to come through Parliament .
if they can handle it in the way that we handled it - I say &apos; we &apos; because all our colleagues , as I said earlier , worked together - then we shall be in an extremely strong position .
what does it mean to consumers , the people who will be affected by this legislation ?
it means safer food across Europe ; it means that if you buy a tomato in Ireland that has come from Spain you can guarantee the quality and safety of that product .
it provides a guarantee that British lamb sold - dare I say - to the French is safe .
that is extremely important for the consumer .
we have included a number of recommendations where , for instance , food is tested at the point of sale , which we have all agreed on .
however , we also agreed that imports need to be of the same level of quality .
this is important for people who import into the European Union .
the levels of pesticides have to be of the same standard - not that they necessarily were or were not ; but it is important that we get that message across for people who come into the European Union .
I shall mention briefly some things we fought over and had great debates about .
good agricultural practices - GAP - was a difficult issue , but we got a definition with the help of the Commission , which I am delighted to see here today .
our colleagues worked closely with the Commission and , as I said , the Council .
this is very important in setting a precedent for the future , so that we know exactly what good agricultural practices are .
it was somewhat difficult to get a position on synergistic effects , but we now have a situation where we know exactly where we are going to be with those effects .
for those who do not know , synergistic effects are a mixture of chemicals possibly used on a crop , and there is no particular definition of how they are traceable .
we have put in place legislation which will work in the future .
it has left a position open for future Member States to be able to define exactly what the situation is on synergistic effects .
I am concerned about how governments will implement this - because it is a regulation and therefore has to be implemented .
I read recently in a paper that governments tend to gold @-@ plate things .
it is important , when we are pushing this through , that governments do not gold @-@ plate it : we want an equal footing .
it is interesting that the British Minister of Agriculture , Mrs Beckett , has said that she will decide when farmers can go into the field , or when it is too wet or has been raining .
I wonder exactly how she is going to do that .
nevertheless , it is important that we do not place governments or countries at a disadvantage compared to other Member States .
that is why this legislation has been put in place .
it is workable , it is a good regulation .
just in case the joint resolutions we have agreed do not go through , the PPE @-@ DE Group has covered itself ; but I expect all the joint amendments to be adopted tomorrow .
I look forward to seeing Member States implementing and working well with it .
. Mr President , honourable Members , I am pleased that it appears that the draft regulation on pesticide residues in food and feed can be adopted at second reading .
the negotiations between Council presidency , the European Parliament rapporteurs and the Commission have recently gained momentum and last week the final obstacles were cleared .
allow me to underline the significance of these regulations for food safety .
it will enable us to set harmonised maximum residue levels in the EU for all pesticides and all agricultural products in one piece of legislation directly applicable to all EU citizens .
all situations will be covered , including a list of pesticides for which no maximum residue levels are required and the low level that will apply systematically to all pesticides for which we have no information .
there will be clarity about how and to whom an MRL application should be made , and on the procedure to be followed .
the European Food Safety Authority will carry out the risk assessment for consumers with the best available methodology .
control and enforcement by the Member States will be reinforced and improved .
coordination of monitoring by the Commission will have a more obligatory nature .
this legislation will benefit all parties .
consumers will profit from better protection and more transparency about which pesticides could be present in food and their potential effects .
food producers will benefit because there will be more clarity as to what specifications the products have to comply with .
control and enforcement bodies will be able to refer to one single Community list of maximum residue levels .
Member State legislators will no longer need to transpose the provisions into national legislation .
before I finish , I would like to make a few comments on the finer points resolved in the negotiations .
the European Parliament &apos;s insistence on taking cumulative and synergistic effects into account may lead to a breakthrough in the development and application of the necessary methodology .
I am pleased that this is now explicitly mentioned in the draft legislation .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s determination to make an explicit link between the setting of maximum residue levels and good agricultural practice , integrated pest management and the use of the lowest amounts of pesticides necessary .
the clear requirement to take into account vulnerable groups of the population , including children and unborn children , is also a useful step forward .
these issues make a positive contribution to this regulation .
the final phase of the negotiations saw an increasing mutual trust among the parties .
I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromise package worked out between the three institutions .
I trust that you will confirm Parliament &apos;s acceptance at the vote tomorrow .
we are now approaching the conclusion of this project .
it is time to acknowledge the efforts of all parties and in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sturdy , for his handling of this dossier and for the time and effort he has put into his report .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we are aiming at includes less bureaucracy and greater simplicity ; this single Regulation is meant to replace four basic directives on pesticide residues .
this is not just about food safety and health , but also about equal opportunities in competing in the internal market and - let us not forget - on the global market .
producers and processors must operate under identical conditions , and all consumers are entitled to safe food .
the European Food Safety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned .
it is no use whatever to consumers to get , week in and week out , one new warning after another , sometimes petering out into such generalisations as the statement that , for example , apples from a particular Member State are exceeding the maximum permitted levels , when such announcements are helpful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive residues of pesticides .
we are setting very high standards right across the EU , particularly where health is concerned , and quite rightly too .
equally , though , we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union .
there is no room for double standards here , and what that means - as I see it - is tighter controls on imported goods .
we cannot intervene in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here , and that makes it all the more important that the end market be checked and monitored .
I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of &apos; good agricultural practice . &quot;
Europe &apos;s farmers produce in accordance with the most stringent legal requirements , as is best known in the case of the rules on cross @-@ compliance .
those who farm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health hazard .
I am grateful to Mr Sturdy for the work he has done over many months , and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Sturdy .
I think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceeded in a pleasant and open atmosphere .
I should like to thank the other &apos; shadow rapporteurs , &quot; and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guidance and advice we have received .
I am pleased that I have been allowed to deliver my first speech here in plenary on a matter as important as this .
in actual fact , I see this draft Act or legislation as an example of the EU at its best .
we shall secure a number of things with this draft Act if it is adopted in the form in which we should like to have it adopted .
firstly , cross @-@ border trade is of course ensured .
a variety of foods is guaranteed , as is their presence on the shelves at lower prices .
other , still more important , things are , however , also ensured , namely consumers &quot; health , safety and security in connection with the foods they buy .
I come from a very cold country up in the north , so I am pleased to be able to buy fruit and vegetables in the winter too .
I am only pleased , however , if I can be sure that the apple I eat is also healthy , and this is something that this legislation can help ensure .
I shall mention a couple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see successfully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromises with which everyone can be satisfied .
firstly , I want to mention the consideration given to especially vulnerable groups .
it is one thing to devise legislation with a view to robust , healthy and vigorous men such as Mr Sturdy and myself .
that is fine , of course .
there also needs , however , to be legislation with a view to more vulnerable groups such as children , born and as yet unborn .
that too is something , I am pleased to say , that we have obtained .
another thing I would emphasise - and I would now apologise to the interpreters for they are about to be confronted by difficult expressions again - is that we have incorporated cumulative effects that are the result of synergy .
that is extremely important .
it sounds a little technical , but in reality it is quite simple .
the fact is , it is not enough only to take account of how poisonous or non @-@ poisonous a pesticide is .
we must also take account of how poisonous or non @-@ poisonous two or three or four pesticides are when they interact , that is to say when they react to each other in a particular food .
that is something it is incredibly important to take account of .
it is an area about which we do not know much at present , but one about which we need to know more in the future and of which we must take more account .
otherwise , there may be major consequences in terms of health .
I fear that that is already now the case .
my third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation , but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions .
I think that naming and shaming is a sensible idea .
I think it is sensible of us now to oblige the Member States to publish their control results on the Internet .
it also brings about openness , which in turn produces security .
the consumer must have peace of mind , and that is something we are in this way guaranteeing .
fourthly and finally , I think it encouraging that we have obtained some clear and constructive definitions , including definitions of good agricultural practice and an actual definition of maximum limit values .
these were not easy things to negotiate successfully but , especially through sound guidance from the Council and the Commission , we obtained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives .
I would say that , all in all , this is a proposal that may make a positive difference to the everyday life of Europeans , and that is something I am pleased about and proud to be associated with .
Mr President , the draft law we are debating in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for Europeans &quot; confidence in food safety .
it is incredibly important for all our voters in our various constituencies , but it is particularly important perhaps for parents with allergic children .
our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection .
I should like to emphasise a few things .
the internal market is incredibly important .
in this internal market , we wish to protect our citizens and , at the same time , set standards for testing and treating food at those links in the chain where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first enters the distribution chain .
in this respect , this proposal is sound .
it is also sound inasmuch as it protects important and vulnerable high @-@ risk groups such as women , infants and unborn children .
we are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice .
in this , we have taken account both of integrated pest control and of climate variations in order to bring about a fairer proposal .
it is incredibly important that these options for taking account of local or regional variations should not reduce the proposal &apos;s level of ambition .
this is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal , once it has properly entered into force .
it is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources .
I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job .
I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non @-@ governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and handling of these issues .
Mr President , it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue .
it is a pity that once again in this Parliament legislation is left until the end of the day .
in a recent opinion poll 77 per cent of British people said that they are concerned about pesticides in food so , as everyone has said , what we are doing here resonates with public opinion .
I am very pleased that we have a compromise and that we agree on the main things .
there are two issues which particularly concern me and I am very pleased that we have secured a deal on them .
the first is cumulative and synergistic effects : cocktail effects .
we were told that there is no methodology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research suggests is at the root of our problems .
I am very pleased to hear the Commissioner say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making sure that we get more research into the cumulative effects .
that is why I tabled the amendment to recital 5 .
one problem is that a lot of experts say that these cumulative effects are unfounded , but we have nothing to prove or disprove this .
we must get this research , it is very important .
the second issue mentioned by Mr Jørgensen is about the effects on children and the unborn .
a lot of research suggests that children and the unborn have in some way been affected by either pesticides or chemicals in our environment .
in a recent radio programme about chemicals they did a series of tests on a grandmother , a mother , and a granddaughter .
these tests showed that the highest level of chemicals was found not in the grandmother - who had lived through the highest levels of pollution in our streets in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s - but in the granddaughter who was 15 years old .
they found in her blood chemicals that had been taken off our shelves many years beforehand .
we know that some of these substances come in through pesticides .
it is extremely important that we start looking not just at testing on adults but at testing on children and looking at the effects on babies in the womb .
public confidence in food safety and food standards is very low .
in the survey that I referred to earlier , over 50 % of British people said they did not believe that government reassurances about pesticides were accurate .
consequently we need to get it right .
scientific research shows that imported products have more pesticides than products grown within the EU .
this is extremely important legislation .
I am very grateful to Mr Sturdy , Mr Jørgensen and all those within the Commission and the Council who worked very hard to achieve a compromise that we can all support tomorrow .
thank you very much .
that concludes the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor , so the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
the next item is the Commission and Council statements on the preparation of the European Council ( 17 December 2004 ) .
. Mr President , the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the first for the new Commission .
it will be an important meeting , marking the next steps in the process of building a larger , more prosperous and safer European Union .
it will be a sign of our ambition for a Union which is dynamic and on the move ; a Union ready to share its destiny with the European family ; a Union which is concerned about the security of its citizens .
I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation .
how else can we generate the trust in Europe &apos;s institutions and politicians that is needed for a smooth ratification of the Constitution ?
we have heard from the presidency about its expectations and the issues that the summit will address .
let me comment briefly on three issues : enlargement , the fight against terrorism and the financial perspectives .
firstly , our policy of enlargement of the Union has been the key in freeing us from our cold war past .
the gravitational pull of the prospect of EU membership has transformed and modernised several post @-@ communist societies .
it has thus reshaped the European order .
this was and remains an achievement of historic proportions that we should not underestimate .
your House has been instrumental in supporting this process , but our enlargement is still incomplete .
this European Council will take the next steps for four countries , offering them the potential - through enlargement - to join the European mainstream .
last October the Commission made it clear that it should be possible to conclude the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in 2004 .
indeed , this negotiating process was closed yesterday , thanks to the increased efforts by the European Union and by these two countries .
I congratulate the Netherlands presidency for its excellent work and close cooperation with the Commission on that particular subject .
the Accession Treaty for both countries now needs to be finalised and we hope that it can be signed after receiving the assent of this House during the spring of next year .
in the remaining period up to accession , the Commission will be watching closely to see that both countries deliver on the commitments made during the negotiations , and in some cases this will mean a further acceleration in their efforts .
at the request of the European Council , on 6 October the Commission adopted its report on Turkey and a clear recommendation .
the main message in the Commission &apos;s assessment is that Turkey has sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria and that accession negotiations should now be opened .
we consider this recommendation , which was very carefully prepared , to be well balanced and a good basis for a decision by the Council .
I am looking forward to taking comfort from the position your House will take on this question later today .
Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks .
it has adopted five of the six pieces of legislation signalled by the Commission in its report ; the sixth law , on the execution of sentences , is pending before the Turkish Parliament .
it is now time for the European Council to honour its commitment to Turkey and announce the opening of accession negotiations .
a clear date should be indicated .
we consider that , apart from the matters I have just mentioned , no other conditions ought to be added .
the European Council will no doubt wish to recall that political reforms will have to continue in the course of the negotiations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress closely .
we should also ask our Turkish friends in all honesty : if you want to become a member of a club , is it not normal that you recognise the other members of the club ?
I am convinced that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process , and preferably sooner than later .
the objective of starting negotiations cannot be other than accession but we accept that the accession process is open @-@ ended and its outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand .
as in the past , transitional arrangements and certain specific safeguards may need to be considered .
but let me state what our ultimate challenge will be : in the end , we need not only to overcome diplomatic obstacles , but also to conquer the hearts and minds of European citizens on this issue .
Croatia represents the first of the Western Balkan nations preparing to start the process for accession to the Union .
the Commission is ready to support the launch of such negotiations , but believes that any progress should be conditional on increased cooperation between the Croatian Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
if such cooperation is confirmed , then negotiations can be started in 2005 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with your permission I should like to turn to one of the twenty @-@ first century &apos;s key challenges , and one which we will also discuss at this week &apos;s Council summit , namely the threat of international terrorism .
what we are dealing with here is the ugly face of globalisation .
international terrorism exploits the advantages of pluralist societies to attack the very foundations of those societies - our freedoms .
I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agreements on how terrorism can be fought .
we must show our unwavering determination , but we must never lose sight of the democratic and legal principles which are at the very basis of our society and our prosperity .
the European Commission has played an active role in promoting and preparing an updated EU action plan on the fight against international terrorism , and I should like to make absolutely clear what we hope the outcome of the decisions to be taken at the end of the week will be .
these decisions must help us to ensure that the EU will be better prepared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks , as well as allowing us to block the sources of funding for terrorists to a greater extent than previously , improving our ability to manage the aftermath of an attack and , finally , ensuring better protection for our key infrastructures .
we should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force .
we should also oppose its perverse logic , by tackling the ideological and social factors which lead individuals to commit such acts .
long @-@ term commitment and a clear political determination will be necessary to overcome this scourge .
the discussions at the summit will also take stock of the situation regarding the Financial Perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
I still believe that the Commission &apos;s proposals are sound , based as they are on a broad political consensus on what the EU must do .
the truth is that the political project on which the Commission &apos;s proposals are based was not actually at risk .
the Commission &apos;s proposals therefore constitute a valid working basis .
the current ceiling for own resources remains in place despite new requests to the EU due to the enlargement and to the development of new policies .
they are therefore reasonable proposals .
what we want to offer , however , is actual added European value , on top of what is offered at national level .
of course , we must ensure discipline in the budgetary process , but this cannot be achieved by setting arbitrary limits , without reference to what the budget aims to achieve .
I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1 % of gross national revenue .
I do not believe that the EU &apos;s policy objectives are compatible with such a figure .
are we prepared to abandon the challenges of social and economic cohesion , which are all the more pressing after enlargement ?
are we really being serious as regards the policy of investing in the major trans @-@ European transport networks ?
are we really being serious as regards the need to foster the European research policy ?
how can we ensure a European contribution towards combating terrorism and towards safeguarding our citizens &quot; security ?
let me state this to you clearly : we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ceases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is forgotten .
a 1 % limit would force us to cut back on our political objectives and would force us to re @-@ assess commitments already made .
the Commission &apos;s position is therefore clear : our starting point is the package submitted in February of last year .
in spite of the Dutch Presidency &apos;s very hard work , the negotiations have , thus far , yet to really begin .
I sincerely hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will be able to drive this process forward and ensure that effective negotiations go ahead , because it is important that we respect the timetable established in the Council &apos;s multiannual strategic programme .
we must ensure that the programmes are fully up and running by 1 January 2007 .
this means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year .
there is one thing I can promise : as always , the Commission will not be the stumbling block to the outcome of negotiations .
we shall help the Member States to reach agreements , but not at any price .
in the short time between the confirmation of the new Commission and the forthcoming European Council , we will have seen important developments both internationally - in particular in Ukraine - and for the Union .
with the decisions on enlargement and security that the European Council will take this week , we are showing in practical ways our confidence in the future of our continent .
we are showing how we can succeed in projecting the values that we hold dear into the international arena and extending the ring of prosperity , solidarity and security further across our continent and the world .
. - Mr President , as with all European Councils , the next one has some very interesting topics to discuss .
I would go further and say that they are not just interesting ; they are perhaps crucial to our Union &apos;s collective future .
consequently , not only will the Heads of State or Government be taking part , but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission .
at this time , we must ask for three indispensable qualities : ambition , adequate resources and practical ideas .
let us look at what this means with regard to each of those topics .
whilst the process of admitting Bulgaria and Romania appears to be going well and the result of genuine efforts on the part of the two countries , we are strongly aware , however , that Romania needs to sprint down the home straight .
whilst we too have no doubts about Croatia - you only need to have been to Zagreb or Dubrovnik to appreciate how embedded it is in European culture - Turkey is a special case , not only due to its geography , but also due to its peculiar cultural and economic characteristics .
the case of Cyprus must not be swept under the carpet while we discuss negotiations .
nevertheless , the opening of negotiations will undoubtedly help to clarify for both sides many areas that are currently in doubt and it will eventually be possible to gauge more clearly what kind of Union would be preferable to both sides .
after all , there are other types of union apart from marriage that could potentially be considered .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , terrorism is certainly one of the Council &apos;s most important portfolios and we must combat it globally and unstintingly .
rogue states that harbour international terrorism , with varying degrees of legality , must be sanctioned by the EU without delay .
international cooperation at various levels - political , financial or operational - must also take place without delay .
in this area , there must be no delay and no lack of resources .
this brings me to the Financial Perspectives , a portfolio that , as far as we are concerned , will set the tone for Europe &apos;s desire to deepen our Union .
the resources must match the ambition .
this is something that Jacques Delors said , and with good reason .
it is not possible , moreover , to cheat the countries that recently joined our European Union , nor those looking hopefully to the EU as an engine to propel democracy and development forward in their countries .
let us be clear .
to think that Europe , the new Europe , our Europe , can be built with the resources of the past is a fallacy and it is worth saying that if ambition and solidarity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the orientations and guidelines that are adopted , we should be ashamed of our current leaders .
Mr President , this brings me to external affairs .
the Council services tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East , Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan , the Mediterranean Partnership and , I should add , probably the situation in Ukraine , Darfur , relations with China and Russia and even Transatlantic relations .
what I am wondering is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few topics , with the desire for a joint , EU @-@ level external service , what resources will we use to seek to influence the international scene ?
will we continue to be a soft power , striving for multilateralism without being in any way active on the international scene ? or will we have at our disposal the resources - the appropriate resources - to finally stop being the political dwarf of the international scene ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall conclude by saying what I said at the beginning .
it is crucial that we speak about the Lisbon Strategy , about combating drugs or AIDS , about the new neighbourhood policy and about sustainable development .
if , however , we do not have the three elements of ambition , adequate resources and practical ideas , we will be speaking as though we were autistic .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should very much like to have been present at a meeting of the Portuguese Social Democrats .
the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , has frequently told us of his &apos; blind dates , &quot; which have attracted the particular interest of this House .
this morning I have now heard from Mr Pinheiro that he prefers forms of cohabitation other than marriage .
interesting things are going on in Portugal .
in this instance , Mr Pinheiro , we are no advocates of the common law marriage the EU is to enter into with Turkey .
we wish relations between the EU and Turkey to be strong , resilient , and stable - in good Christian Democrat style .
I would also warn you against speaking of cultural differences , Mr Pinheiro .
this community of values is open to everyone who shares these values , without any kind of cultural relativity , and this is a point I should like to reiterate once again .
this is self @-@ evident to our group , and , yesterday , we decided with what I think was almost 99 % of votes within our group ...
in an open ballot , not a secret ballot , to give Mr Eurlings our support for his belief that , if this order of values can be enshrined in a Muslim society , it will be proof that this order of values is open to every person , of whatever religion , skin colour and cultural or ethnic background they may be .
the reason why this is such an important issue , Mr Pinheiro , is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the preliminary debates .
I believe that there is a direct connection between this issue and the question of whether we will manage to disprove the theory that the Islam of the most dangerous terrorists currently active , the Islamic fundamentalists , which they describe as the only Islam , and the order of values I referred to a moment ago are mutually exclusive .
I believe that the mere opening of negotiations with Turkey , a step which also means that Turkey is prepared to submit to the Constitution and its rules , is evidence that the implementation of a secular social reality is not linked in any way to religion , but instead to the political will of a people .
this is the crucial point , and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism .
I therefore believe that the debate on Turkey and the debate on the fight against terrorism are two sides of the same coin .
during yesterday &apos;s preparations for today &apos;s debate , we too discussed Romania and Bulgaria , and developments in both these countries .
I will not deny that we regret that our friend , Mr Nastase , lost the presidential elections .
it was a fair decision , and we should like to congratulate Mr Basescu .
we only hope that Mr Basescu has a sufficient sense of responsibility , something which he did not demonstrate during the election campaign , not to enter into coalitions with parties in his country which are opposed to the European Union and which ride roughshod over our fundamental values .
you may be sure , Mr Watson , that we will continue to observe Romania as closely as you have done to date , particularly with regard to the issue of whether the future Romanian President forms a coalition with the extreme right .
this is something you can depend on , and something we will observe particularly closely .
we believe that the debate that is on the Council &apos;s agenda ...
should consolidate what the European Union has achieved in its role as mediator in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council .
on behalf of our group , I should like to say - and I also address these words to the Dutch Presidency - that the European Union has provided an enormous amount of support throughout what has been going on in Ukraine over recent weeks , which represents a fundamental shift in the internal political situation towards democracy , freedom and human rights .
it was the EU that acted as mediator in the country , and I believe that the staunch support of all those concerned , including the Dutch Presidency , has made it possible to achieve progress which will result in a greater degree of democracy , and which has proven that a united European Union , combining its forces and deploying them jointly , can make a genuine contribution to international politics .
for this we are grateful , and we would like to extend our renewed thanks to all those involved , including Mr Solana , Mr Kwaśniewski and also the Dutch Presidency .
Mr Nicolaï , I would ask you to pass on our group &apos;s thanks to the Council .
. Mr President , the Netherlands presidency is likely to be remembered for the decision on Turkey .
a majority of the members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe believe that Turkey fulfils the political criteria and that you should open negotiations .
it seems to us important that Europe should not define itself as a Christian club .
and yet , by the same token , we must beware of an aggressive secularism , which could drive away many of those who belong in our community .
I pay tribute to the work of Mr Eurlings in drawing up the report on Turkey for this House ; a report which I think commands widespread support .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , when it discusses Turkey , your Council will meet in secret .
it is important that in this House , when we discuss and vote on Turkey , we do so openly and in public and not in secret .
I also recommend to the Council that we have a discussion in our Union about the European Union &apos;s capacity to absorb new Member States , particularly countries beyond those which currently have candidate status .
I recommend that we have a discussion on the nature of the European Union , because it is our vision of the European Union that will determine its borders , rather than our vision of countries wishing to join .
the Council will also discuss Bulgaria and Romania .
my Group has long believed that these two countries - and indeed others - should have separate accession treaties .
Bulgaria closed all of its negotiating chapters earlier this year and has made good progress .
in Romania , progress has been much less easy to see .
for me , the election results this week give cause for hope .
I believe that the concerns of many can now be set aside and that with resolve and goodwill , we can bring Romania into the European Union effectively in 2007 .
I say to my friend Mr Schulz : for heaven &apos;s sake stop defending corrupt socialist regimes , whether in the Maldives , the Seychelles or in Romania .
I thought Mr Basescu was actually a member of the Socialist International , but I may be wrong .
you should not be defending regimes which are doing things that are not worthy of your party .
I believe that we now have the chance to move ahead with Romania and we must do so .
on Croatia , President @-@ in @-@ Office , I recommend that you hold open the door , but insist on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
high on your agenda , too , will be terrorism and I pay tribute to the work of the Council &apos;s anti @-@ terrorism coordinator .
you need promptly to put into practice measures that have been identified in the Hague Programme relevant to combating terrorism , in particular , measures relating to exchange of information between Member States .
efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Council must stress the importance of promoting respect based on universal values , tolerance , dialogue and democratic participation .
too often , our approach in this Union to the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice has concentrated on security and justice at the expense of freedom .
I hope that your presidency , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , will ensure that the balance is set right .
we need to get our police forces and judiciary working together .
we need to move the European Union from being simply an economic community into seeing itself as a community of values .
but for that to have the support of our citizens , it means recognising the fundamental importance of the values outlined in our Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the appropriate financial framework will be discussed in a building aptly named after a Dutchman , Mr Justus Lipsius .
my Group welcomes the methodical approach of your presidency to preparations for the Union &apos;s budget from 2007 to 2013 , but we are not sure whether your building blocks are independent building blocks or a Rubik &apos;s Cube .
is any outcome possible other than the one per cent to which your country was a signatory in the letter to Mr Prodi ?
it seems to my Group that we need to give the European Union the resources it needs .
it is better to spend 1.2 per cent well than to spend less than 1 per cent badly .
while , as a Scot , I welcome the approach of my soulmates in the Netherlands to the financing of the Union , I believe that the Council must give the Union the resources it needs .
you must also heed the report of the Court of Auditors and tackle the failure in our Member States to put adequate controls in place on the spending of European Union money .
in conclusion , the Council will discuss ESDP .
operation &apos; Althea &apos; is working successfully and three other ongoing missions are examples of solid progress .
let the Union &apos;s voice be heard in our neighbourhood policy and in our relations with China , the United States and Russia .
although the headline of the forthcoming European Council may be Turkey - and we should expect no less for a pillar of European civilisation - beyond the headlines there is much important work to do in foreign and security policy .
Mr President , I have never made use of this Rule before , but I would ask to be allowed the following clarification .
I would never defend a corrupt regime , whether headed by socialists or by anyone else , and this is something I should like to stress at this point .
rather than defending anyone , I merely appealed to Mr Basescu .
I made no reference to any corrupt politician , in any country , and I should like , here and now , to say that any person who is corrupt should be punished and should not head a government .
it is however equally unacceptable for people to come under general suspicion merely because they belong to a certain political family .
it is clear that Mr Schulz has spoken pursuant to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure , which allows Members to speak for three minutes in response to personal comments made during the debate .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall use two minutes of Mr Schulz &apos;s speaking time , which means that I have five minutes to speak .
our debate today is on culture , and on what is and what is not European culture .
it is an issue on which I should like to make a few comments .
I am always sceptical when anyone tells me that things are culturally incompatible , and this is perhaps due to family reasons .
we are all aware of how often Jews have been persecuted for marrying non @-@ Jews , and how often white people have been persecuted for marrying black people , and such persecution has always been carried out under the pretext of cultural incompatibility .
I am also astonished at the emotional fervour , or in some cases even political blindness , with which debates relating to Turkey are conducted .
I am well aware that there are worthy people with worthy arguments who are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU .
it is entirely normal for worthy arguments to exist both for and against such an accession , and yet I am perplexed by the level of aggressiveness of those who are opposed to Turkey joining the EU .
the basis for racism is always irrationality , and I cannot help but think that certain arguments against Turkey &apos;s accession are not political , but purely cultural , or , in other words , racist .
we cannot tolerate such a thing .
what kind of an example are we setting to Turkey and to the world ?
Mr Poettering has told this House that this is the most important decision to be taken by the European Parliament and by Europe in recent years , and that , as it is so important , we should take the decision in utmost secrecy , so that everyone is left in the dark with regard to how we have reached our position on this important issue .
this House is to hold a secret ballot .
can you just be quiet ?
afterwards , you may speak for three minutes , like Mr Schulz .
I shall say what I wish to say , and you may say what you wish to say .
you may speak after I have finished .
if Members of this House demand secrecy , it is because they do not want voters throughout Europe to know where we as individual Members stand on this key issue .
it is a disgrace to democracy that the vote should be conducted in this way .
it is a scandal .
you should give some consideration to what the people of Turkey will think .
one can perfectly well be opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , but what will the men and women of Turkey think if they are told that this is an issue they are not allowed to know anything about ?
do Europeans really want us to hold sittings in public and to provide public records of votes , as preached repeatedly and especially in Mr Poettering &apos;s incessant sermons to the Council ?
this is something we wish to know , and this is something that is enshrined in the Constitution .
this Parliament , a moral authority for good behaviour , has suddenly decided on the most incomprehensible and undemocratic course of action possible , and I find this impossible to understand .
I should like to make one more remark on Romania .
cultural differences sometimes also exist between the EU and societies which will shortly be joining it , for example the pervasive corruption in Romania , something which is a simple fact .
we therefore call on the Romanian Parliament to take us seriously .
Romania should be accepted into the EU , but only after it has met the Copenhagen criteria .
at present it does not yet meet them , which is a fact that must be stated , and we should not accept it until it does .
Romania will be accepted ...
... make use of a Rule of which others have also availed themselves , and I have no doubts as to this being the case .
despite any claims to the contrary by Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , I am not connected in any way to this matter , and I disapprove of his having used bogus arguments which bear no relation to the truth .
. Mr President , on 17 December a decision is to be taken on whether accession negotiations with Turkey should be opened .
accession to the EU represents a major opportunity for Turkey , as there is still a need for the values it represents , such as the rule of law , democracy and human rights , to gain acceptance there .
there is therefore an urgent need for the negotiations to be conducted transparently , and for the democratic changes necessary in Turkey to be spelled out .
this is particularly true in the case of the violent clashes in the Kurdish regions , and I would call on the Kurds and the Turkish armed forces to reach a ceasefire and to seek a political solution .
I am extremely concerned at the increase in human rights violations and homicides , for example the case of the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Urud and his father , as well as the new proceedings which have been initiated with the aim of banning the Union of Education and Science Workers .
if there are to be accession negotiations , it would be up to Turkey to demonstrate , by means of a genuine implementation of its reform plans , that all Turkish citizens , regardless of their origin , are accorded the same rights , that there is equality of the sexes and that certain religions are no longer discriminated against in favour of others .
it is crucial for the Ankara Government not only to adopt laws in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria , but also to implement them in practice .
the 20 million Kurds in Turkey hope that , when accession negotiations are opened , their rights , too , will be secured , that they will be able to express their identity freely , that they will be acknowledged and that it will become possible for them to return to their villages .
it is necessary for the village guard system to be abolished and for the 10 % clause for elections to be reduced .
last weekend thousands of people demonstrated in Diyarbakir for the opening of accession negotiations .
as a German MEP of Kurdish origin , I should like to join my group in calling for accession negotiations with Turkey to be opened , and we call on all Heads of Government to make known , on 17 December , their support for the opening of accession negotiations .
the European Union should not fear Ankara , and Ankara should not fear Diyarbakir .
Turkey can act as a bridge between the EU and Islamic countries .
Mr President , I want to make my point of order just as Mr Schulz made his .
last month you refused a point of order from me because I did not mention the number of the Rule .
on this occasion , Mr Schulz was allowed to make a point of order without mentioning a Rule number .
could you say what the rules are and why there is one rule for him and another for me ?
I believe that you are invoking Rule 145 .
I am merely asking why there is one rule for him and one rule for me .
you were in the chair both times .
is it not time that you understood the Rules ?
Mr Knapman , please behave properly .
if you wish to speak , please tell me which Rule you wish to invoke .
if you tell me that you wish to speak on the basis of no particular Rule , you do not have the right to take the floor .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the next Council summit will focus on Turkey , and I shall do the same in my speech , even though the French sovereignists , as I noted the day before yesterday , have already made known the reasons for their opposition .
this time I would like to look at the issue from a different angle , and to warn the Council against the decision it is going to take .
it is my belief that this decision will have extremely serious consequences , not merely as a result of Turkey &apos;s entry , but also in terms of the European Union &apos;s image amongst the peoples of Europe .
firstly , the public is less and less sure of what we regard as our borders .
if Turkey were allowed to join , the borders would be blurred , and the door would be open to a large number of Turkish @-@ speaking countries , including the countries of the Caucasus such as Georgia .
in short , we are currently slipping into a kind of world state , the foundation for which is merely a hazy catalogue of good intentions labelled &apos; human rights . &quot;
this development is incomprehensible to many Europeans , all the more so because - and this is my second point - we are at the same time turning our back on what Europeans see as the essence of Europe , and what has been loosely , and perhaps clumsily , described as its Christian roots .
in spite of everything , there is a very well @-@ defined idea of the way of life and civilisations of which Europe is made up .
we are moving ever further away from these , and we no doubt do not realise the extent to which we are insulting and shocking citizens , trapped as we are in the hustle and bustle of the globalised elite .
my third point is that the first consequences will not be long in coming .
the forthcoming referendum has meant that the French people are beginning to see the link between Turkey and the Constitution , and they will vote accordingly .
I would therefore like to remind the Council of their responsibility for the outcome of the decisions they take next Friday .
. Mr President , no matter how much you try to dance around the issue , the subject of Turkey is bound to be divisive .
it is bound to create the kind of tensions and inflame the passions that we have seen not only here this morning , but also in our debate yesterday .
one of the most important issues that we have to look at as a Parliament and as a Union is : what message do we send if we refuse to open the door to negotiations with Turkey at the weekend ?
we set down certain rules and criteria which must be met by Turkey before negotiations can be allowed to begin .
the Commission has laid out a very clear blueprint of how much has been achieved and what has yet to be done before we reach the final hurdle .
but we have also demanded that Turkey should fulfil its responsibilities and duties .
there is , for instance , the question of the recognition of Cyprus and the independence and integrity of Cyprus .
then there are certain human rights issues that were mentioned by Mr Coûteaux , the previous speaker .
it is interesting to hear a Kurd speaking about Turkey being part of the European Union .
that is an important message that we should take acknowledge and follow .
our voice , our message , will determine whether or not the voice of moderate Muslims will be heard or whether we drive people back into a fundamentalist response and attitude .
that is why , if we oppose Turkey coming into the European Union because we are fearful of its impact on our economies or its impact on the balance of power within the institutions , we should say so clearly .
we should not try to hide behind some false pretence that it is going to change the way Europe operates forever .
the European Union of today is a very different animal from its 1973 incarnation .
indeed , one of the things that is lacking in the European Union of today is the vision and inspiration of the founding fathers who made the phoenix of peace , prosperity and solidarity rise from the ashes .
the responsibility of and onus on this generation to extend a hand to other countries is as great today as it was in the 1940s and 1950s .
indeed , quite a few members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats wish to vote against the Eurlings report because they are squarely opposed to Turkey joining , but dare to do so only when the way they vote is concealed from the general public .
for fear of possible criticism , though , and of all the consequences that this entails for their careers in their own countries , where their governments , haughtily laughing off popular opinion , want to give Ankara the go @-@ ahead the day after tomorrow , they will not do so if the vote is public and not secret .
the same may apply to quite a few Members of the Socialist Group .
I would remind you of the valiant positions taken up in France on the Turkey issue by Robert Badinter , Hubert Védrine and the former Socialist Education Minister , Claude Allègre , all of whom have cautioned us about the disastrous consequences of Turkey &apos;s possible accession .
it is indicative of the lack of democratic openness with which this issue has been addressed for years now .
in Helsinki , only three minutes were taken to discuss the question as to whether Turkey should obtain candidate status .
that is what is reported by the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market , Mr Bolkestein , who was the only person with the courage to tell Mr Prodi that he refused to approve the positive Commission recommendation of 6 October .
three minutes to decide whether we move the hotbeds of conflict in the Caucasus and the Middle East to Europe &apos;s boundaries .
three minutes to decide whether tomorrow , we will again offer millions of immigrants the opportunity to flood our continent .
three minutes to decide whether we allow a country , where human rights in general and women &apos;s rights in particular are violated on a large scale , entry into our Union as a so @-@ called model secular state and straight away give them the largest number of votes in the Council .
three minutes to give the go @-@ ahead to a country that refuses to recognise another Member State and occupies part of that Member State with 30.000 troops after having committed untold crimes against humanity .
three minutes to give the go @-@ ahead to a country where the state &apos;s denial of the Armenian genocide is organised by the Ministry of Education , while nobody in Europe utters a word about this .
I ask you , Europe , where are your grand principles ?
Mr President , we are at an important crossroads here in this House and the key issue these days - not only in politics , but also among the public - is , of course , the possible start of negotiations with Turkey .
as rapporteur , I should like to say , as I have said before , that my visits there have left me in two minds .
on the one hand , there is a great deal of progress , and impressive progress too ; on the other , Turkey is still trailing behind quite a bit if we were to compare that country with a country that really wants to become a Member of the European Union .
that is why reforms have to continue in the areas of human rights , women &apos;s rights and religious freedom .
I cannot emphasise enough that pressure in those areas must be simply unrelenting .
indeed , the Turkish media and Turkish journalists urge us to use the stick and carrot approach and keep up the pressure .
human rights have to be implemented more effectively .
a switch in mentality is required in the area of religious minorities , so that people are proud of minority religions instead of trying to oppress them .
in the field of , for example , the law on foundations , further legal amendments must be tabled in order to offer scope to minority religions and minority cultures .
that is why , quite apart from the whole core discussion that has been going on for months in this House and elsewhere , I should like to press home the fact that it would be good if an important section of the report that is now before us for final vote were also to be included in the Council &apos;s conclusions .
it concerns the following .
I shall read out a few sentences in English , because I have the English text in front of me .
I think that this emphasis on the political criteria is necessary , because not everyone in Turkey realises that the reforms will need to be carried out consistently if the country really wants to qualify for membership of the European Union .
I think that these further reforms will determine whether or not Turkey will be able to do this .
I have another brief remark to make .
if we discuss political criteria , then I would like to say that if I compare Turkey to , for example , Romania , and I consider the poor treatment in prisons , the physical attacks on investigative journalists and corruption , I take the view that the Council should send out a message , and maximum pressure should be brought to bear in order to solve such matters .
in my view , those practices are not in line with the political criteria which we uphold .
my final remark concerns terrorism .
I am glad that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has made this a key issue .
I am also glad that the Netherlands - in the spirit of practising what you preach - will now finally start banning organisations that are on the European list of terrorists .
I should like to ask the presidency to convey to the other Member States that we should stand united in this .
consequently , to name but one concrete example , ETA should be banned in all countries , and not only in Spain and France .
can the presidency guarantee now that with the exchange of information agreement , it will no longer be possible for one country to hold information about attacks in another country , without this information being automatically exchanged ?
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that Parliament will adopt the Eurlings report on Turkey in the version approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I also hope it will do so by secret ballot .
I believe that my fellow Members are wrong in thinking that a secret ballot may favour a shift away from that position ; on the contrary , I expect that Members in this Chamber will demonstrate that they are not subject to any pressures when freely carrying out their mandate .
as regards the remainder of the foreign reports , I agree with much of what Mr Nicolaï said and I should like to express our agreement on all the measures that bring forward constitutional reforms .
in the High Representative &apos;s actions in Ukraine we have glimpsed a sign that the initiative in that direction is being strengthened .
the initiative should , however , be supported by more substantial instruments , which are foreseen in the Constitution but which might perhaps be brought forward .
with regard to the neighbourhood policy , we encourage the Commission and the Council in their work .
we point out the danger , however , that the measures to create a free @-@ trade area may take precedence over the other policies .
I would stress that we do not just want to create a free @-@ trade area , and so we should be careful not to weaken the policy &apos;s regional and subregional dimension .
as regards human rights and democracy , I recommend that we negotiate a proper convention with our neighbouring countries .
such a convention should at last spell out the shared values that we so often refer to and define them carefully in formal terms , particularly for the sake of the Mediterranean countries .
the convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them .
regarding the Middle East , we must ensure that the presidential elections in Palestine give the road map a new boost and that the Israeli Government &apos;s unilateral decisions , such as the withdrawal from Gaza , are included in the negotiations with the Quartet , so that the creation of the Palestinian state can be completed within the established time frame .
to that end , this issue will have to be placed at the heart of the relationship between the European Union and the United States .
on the subject of Iraq , we consider that the hoped @-@ for turnaround has failed to materialise even after the Sharm el @-@ Sheikh conference and that the aim of holding elections may well be jeopardised by the violent situation in the country .
finally , I call on the Council and the Commission to devote attention also to the situation in Cambodia , where there is a humanitarian emergency concerning children .
Mr President , the Dutch Presidency is nearly at an end .
in the first place , I should like to assess the efforts it has made towards reducing regulation at European level .
the aim was to end the Brussels bureaucracy and to cut the number of regulations it produced by at least 25 % .
needless to say , we are far from reaching that percentage , but the tone has been set , and I regard that as a great bonus in itself .
after all , if there are fewer rules and regulations , there is more room for entrepreneurship , because it is the entrepreneurs who have to save the European economy .
I still think it desirable , though , to appoint a European Commissioner to focus solely on the elimination of superfluous and obsolete rules .
a second topic addressed during the Dutch Presidency was the so @-@ called Hague decisions about terrorism and combating crime .
the agreements reached in The Hague illustrate that the European Union and the Council too - at long last - consider the fight against terrorism and crime as one of their priorities .
at the same time , a balance has been struck between an effective approach and extra legal scope on the one hand and the protection of personal data and fundamental freedoms on the other .
after all , we are still being put through our paces on that score , and I think that the Council has done a reasonably good job .
the topic of human rights has not received a great deal of attention , but sound work has been done on it .
I would particularly mention the protection of the defenders of human rights .
under the Dutch Presidency , the practical implementation of the EU directives concerning human rights defenders has moved one step closer .
a manual will be compiled for the EU delegations across the world ; it will provide for a prompt , flexible and consistent reaction from the EU when human rights defenders are in peril of death or are at risk of abuse .
I congratulate Mr Nicolaï on the inclusion in the agenda of the need for good communication about European integration .
the public still considers Europe to be far removed from their own personal lives and are far too ready to turn their backs on it .
it is only by frequent communication and a constant dialogue with the citizen , not only by the Members of this House , but also by the members of the Commission and the Council , that this gap can be bridged .
I should like to finish off with a remark about the debate about standards and values with which this presidency started .
as a Liberal , I feel hesitant about such a debate , in general , and about the purely Christian nature that the Christian Democrats tend to lend it , in particular .
I also find it objectionable that the Left have devalued the terms &apos; standards &quot; and &apos; values . &quot;
it is important that this debate should have made a start ; after all , it is a debate about what Europe is , where it should be heading , where our boundaries are and what we are doing , or not , as the case may be .
in short , it is a debate about where our foundations lie .
money is not , indeed , the EU &apos;s only .
I think that Mr Balkenende &apos;s article in of 7 December was excellent ; one of his conclusions was that the Union is about dynamic values .
I see these as including respect , responsibility and confidence .
we have in any event made a start on the discussion and although the end is not in sight by a long way , this is still worth a compliment for this presidency .
on a final note , the presidency has definitely brought the European Union closer to the Dutch people and even to members of the Dutch parliament .
this , I know , is Mr Nicolaï &quot; s crusade , and it has proved very successful ; as a Dutch MEP , I too am pleased with it .
Mr President , I should like to start with the financial perspective .
at the summit , I hope that you will really take the time to discuss at length the kind of Europe that you have in mind , before you pass this subject back to the specialist ministers .
some Member States want a smaller budget than the present one , which is just above 1 % .
the Council prescribes that no cuts must be made in the agricultural budget , and it seems unlikely that any agreement will be reached on cuts in the structural funds .
where do you think cuts will be made ?
they will be made in research and development , human rights , the environment , external affairs , youth exchanges and culture - precisely those areas which are close to people &apos;s hearts and which visibly add value at European level .
a budget that is born of euroscepticism will only breed more of it .
with regard to terrorism , the draft conclusions of the forthcoming summit state that we , in our efforts to fight terrorism , must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms .
while agreeing with those conditions , I fear that this may be no more than an incantation .
I would refer to the discussion about storing communications data of all telephone and Internet users or the biometric data on passports .
the motto is : strict , stricter , strictest .
it seems almost inappropriate to ask critical questions about the effectiveness or the legitimacy of measures against terrorism .
like all army generals , those fighting terrorism in Europe always want the top gear .
at least in defence purchases , politicians always independently weigh up costs and benefits .
where measures to fight terrorism are concerned , though , almost nobody dares make this critical assessment .
nonetheless , I would invite you to do just that at the forthcoming summit , because at this rate , we will mess up our rule of law , and terrorists will have their way after all .
finally , I should like to make a brief comment about transparency .
the Dutch Presidency has pledged to try to emphasise the implementation of the clause in the Constitution on the basis of which the Member States will have public meetings henceforth - after all , they were all agreed on this when the Constitution was signed - or at least hold more of them in public .
I should like to ask Mr Nicolaï what he has achieved on that score .
I hope that during the Luxembourg Presidency , the doors of the Council of Ministers will be truly open .
we will then be able to see in all openness what is going on , and it will be possible for ministers to be held responsible for the decisions taken , as we today are keen to be held responsible for the decision we are taking on Turkey .
- Ladies and gentlemen , the conclusions of the summit of the European Union to be held on 16 and 17 December are so important that they determine to a significant degree the physiognomy of the European Union .
enlargement , with the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey , requires decisions , the consequences of which will be decisive .
we must clarify from the outset that we are not against Turkey &apos;s European prospects .
we expect such prospects to bind any country pursuing such prospects within a minimum framework of obligations pertaining to basic issues which apply to the other Member States , such as fundamental freedoms , civil rights and workers &apos; rights , without of course harbouring any illusions .
however , these obligations must be laid down from the outset and be accepted by Turkey .
how could it ever be possible for a candidate country to be allowed not to recognise the existence of another Member State and for this issue not to be clearly laid down at the summit ?
how will this question be answered if there is real equality between the Member States or if , ultimately , there are two sets of standards and two yardsticks ?
it is , in my opinion , a not only for there to be mutual recognition but also for there to be normalisation of relations between Cyprus and Turkey , not only because the European Union and the principles which govern its operation so command , but also because the Cyprus problem needs to be resolved in order for right to prevail for the benefit of our people , both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots .
no nation in the world wants the illegal occupation of and hatred and partition in their country and this cannot be perpetuated .
the European Union must open a window for the safeguarding of the basic principles of its very existence and call for the application of this minimum framework of obligations and must also open a window for the simple citizens by showing that it does not take decisions using two sets of standards and two yardsticks .
to close , I wish to condemn the arrogant conduct of the Turkish leadership and its government when , in the statements it makes , the impression is given that it is the European Union which is asking for Turkey to join and not Turkey which is asking to join the European Union .
Mr President , nothing could show Mr Barroso &apos;s contempt for this Parliament more than the fact that he could only attend this debate for a few minutes before disappearing .
on the subject of Ukraine , after the way in which he pushed through the election of his criminals and Commissioners , let us stop pretending that we can in any way lecture Ukraine on democracy .
with regard to Turkey , we will not be supporting its membership application , just as we did not in the last Parliament , on the grounds of both cost and likely migration patterns .
had anybody in authority been here , I would have asked for confirmation that the cost could be in the order of GBP 19 billion or EUR 28 million .
this means that Turkey is costing us as much as the ten countries that acceded to this Union this year .
could we please know what the cost will be , because for the first time you are hearing from a nation that is actually paying for it .
although the Labour Party in Britain wants to put GBP 5 billion towards it , the Conservative Party believes that GBP 5 billion is a good price to pay and believes you can still have tax cuts .
presumably it also thinks that pigs can fly .
can we actually have confirmation of the cost of 19 billion ?
also , will some EUR 700 million be spent on around 60 diverse training projects in Turkey ?
is that the true cost , or is there a more up @-@ to @-@ date figure ?
we know that Turkey &apos;s population growth rate remains phenomenal and that it has serious economic problems , including 70 per cent inflation .
seventy per cent inflation during the passage of the Maastricht Treaty would have caused some raising of eyebrows , but it is just a political project here , is it not ?
especially for those who do not pay .
we also know that human rights concerns are widespread .
on that basis I would say , on behalf of the UK Independence Party , that we will offer Turkey friendship and free trade , but we will not offer the country political union - especially with the corruption and fraud that are endemic in this place .
we have often said that Bulgaria and Romania ought to join the Union , though we are particularly concerned about the areas in which there is still a wide gap between the current situation in those two countries and the European average .
in that respect we would point to their legislation on human rights , social protection for workers and economic development , which should reach significant levels by the end of the decade .
although in principle we are in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey - which , I stress , is a very different thing from accession - we must not forget the need for its acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide and for a lasting solution to the Cyprus question .
to somebody with any common sense , it is incomprehensible that a country that aspires to join the Union should be militarily occupying part of another country that is already a member .
we are not at all worried about the voting system that we should use .
I believe in the freedom of all Members to make their own decisions , regardless of whether the vote is open or in secret .
I think this is just a formality and certainly not a question of any substance .
the fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over .
I believe , however , that the Union should maintain an ever stronger presence through its policies and aid in those parts of the world that surround it and in which there are ongoing , sometimes tragic situations of conflict .
by doing so it can exert a stabilising influence to support those sections of society that accept the values which characterise our democracy .
Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that Mr Nicolaï will not leave the Chamber this time , as he did during the last debate on the EU &apos;s relations with Russia .
Mr Barroso , who has already left , said that the December Council would be a great step towards the building of a more prosperous Europe .
judging from Mr Nicolaï &quot; s comments , however , it is more likely to be a small and timid step , not a great one .
I am not the only one who feels that the Council is working without any kind of serious vision and without any long @-@ term strategy , that it lurches from one event to another , and that it merely reacts to problems without any long @-@ term plan of how it should act to avoid them .
this lack of strategy is a fundamental error , and it gives rise to a great many problems .
much is now being said by the Council on the subject of Ukraine , and many of its comments are entirely relevant .
yet if the Council had stated clearly a few months ago , as part of its future strategy , that Ukraine would join the European Union , not today , not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow , but maybe at the same time as Turkey , then the current situation in Ukraine would not have arisen , as the Ukrainian Government would not have been able to afford to rig the elections to such an extent .
there is one thing I should like to thank the absent Mr Barroso for , namely that he was in favour of a larger budget for the European Union .
an increase of EUR 114 billion over seven years will promote the development of both the EU and the new Member States .
Mr President , the meeting of the European Council later this week is of historic significance , primarily because of the fundamental issue of the opening of negotiations with Turkey on future membership of the EU .
there are very strongly held views on this issue across this Parliament and beyond .
I acknowledge that .
however , the policy of my party is clear : we believe that in the right circumstances Turkish membership of the Union could be good for Europe , good for Turkey and good for relations with the Islamic world and security in our societies .
I accept that the negotiations with Turkey are likely to be lengthy and at times difficult , but this week the Council should take a first step in that process .
like any other applicant country , Turkey must satisfy all the criteria required in terms of human rights and economic and political reform .
this might be very difficult , but by agreeing to the formal opening of negotiations the Council will send a clear message to the Turkish Government that we expect it to work assiduously to achieve the steps necessary for eventual membership .
the issue of Bulgarian and Romanian membership of the Union will also feature on the agenda and the objective there must be to affirm the accession of both countries whilst recognising that a great amount of work remains to be done - in particular in the case of Romania - to ensure they remain on track .
the issue of economic reform in the Union was discussed at the last Council in November .
however , I hope that the Netherlands presidency and the heads of government will reaffirm their commitment to kick @-@ starting the Lisbon agenda .
earlier this week the Socialist Group expressed concern at the neo @-@ liberal nature of the new Commission .
I want to make it clear that we expect Mr Barroso and his team to be true to their earlier statements on the need to reinvigorate the economy in Europe and the crack @-@ down on red tape and regulation .
the outdated social model so beloved of the left is to be replaced with a vigorous , dynamic and radical reform programme .
this is the only way to deal with the high unemployment and sluggish growth that has led to Europe lagging behind the United States and the burgeoning economies of China and India .
if the Commission acts in this way , it will get the full support of British Conservatives .
Mr President , the next European Council is not just going to give its opinion on Turkey and other issues , but also - as Mr Nicolaï has mentioned - on the broad guidelines for the next financial perspectives .
I would like to point out once again that the financial perspectives are an instrument of budgetary discipline and not an accounting instrument , an instrument that fundamentally serves to provide stability and allows for reasonable medium @-@ term planning of the Union &apos;s policies .
this instrument is so important that it appears as a law in the future Constitution .
the Commission yesterday and its President , Mr Barroso , today , have confirmed that they fully accept the proposal of their predecessor .
Mr Barroso said a moment ago that the Commission &apos;s proposal is a starting point for negotiations of the financial perspectives .
nevertheless , I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective energetically .
in that way , that starting point could also become a finishing point and the Commission would thereby respond to that expression that we mention so often : we cannot create more Europe with fewer resources .
the Council and Parliament must also fulfil their respective responsibilities and face up to the challenges confronting us .
firstly , economic and social cohesion is not just a principle enshrined in the Treaties and enhanced in the future Constitution , but also a necessary condition for maintaining and protecting the European social model .
secondly , with regard to the enlargement we have just carried out , we must not spare any effort when it comes to the new citizens of the Union .
thirdly , five years ago we set some very ambitious objectives .
we are at the halfway point and we are very far from achieving , by 2010 , a competitive knowledge @-@ based society with full employment , as we proposed in Lisbon and Gothenburg .
fourthly , we are in the middle of the process of ratifying the European Constitution and the citizens sometimes show even more enthusiasm than their representatives .
faced with these challenges , we cannot be miserly towards our citizens .
we would be making a great mistake if we were to try to incorporate them into this project we call European integration - and everything it represents - while at the same time reducing the Union &apos;s resources .
we must continue to build a Europe with the necessary resources , with the resources laid down in the Treaty , and use them efficiently .
that would undoubtedly be the best guarantee we can offer future generations of a future of peace , freedom and prosperity .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you have had a tough Presidency involving many controversial issues , dramatic events in the surrounding world , the procedure surrounding the Commission and , in particular , the internal political unrest caused by the appalling murder of Theo van Gogh .
these factors must have affected your ambitions and efforts when it came to security and combating terrorism .
action plans and programmes are fine , but little has happened so far .
if the European Council can make progress at the Summit , all well and good .
it must not be forgotten that security and the fight against terrorism must never push aside protection of individual privacy .
we have debated most of the issues on the agenda together in this House .
you were here on Monday evening and listened to the debate on Turkey .
in a few hours &quot; time , we are to vote on Mr Eurlings &quot; report .
I believe that a solid majority of MEPs will vote in favour of giving Turkey a date .
in that connection , I wish to say how deplorable it is that certain people in this House have pushed through a policy that makes the final vote secret .
this Parliament is always at the forefront of openness and transparency , and the politician who does not dare to look his or her electorate in the eye on this issue has no place in this House .
nonetheless , we expect you to have the courage to take this historic decision and , notwithstanding all the difficulties , to give Turkey a starting date with a view to its obtaining full membership .
only in that way can the democratic process continue .
this will also give a clear signal to the tens of thousands of Kurds in Diyarbakir who , at the weekend , demonstrated in favour of EU membership for Turkey .
you mentioned the European security policy , together with disarmament .
I assume that you will be discussing the agreement concluded by Iran with three of the Member States .
it is , of course , extremely positive that Teheran intends to suspend its extraction of uranium .
there are still , however , considerable doubts about what really lies behind this decision .
we should be very vigilant before making any concessions to the Iranian regime , which must prove that it is serious and that it is not only , as so often , playing a strategic game .
the mullahs in Teheran govern with an iron hand a country in which human rights are completely neglected .
there is no reason for rewarding such a country until we see practical improvements in this area .
the Social Democratic Government in my country maintains - although it may be mistaken , as it often is - that the issue of the embargo on arms sales to China will come up on Friday .
if that is the case , I would remind you of the solid opposition in this House to lifting the embargo .
this would send out completely the wrong signals to the Chinese regime .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , certain speeches on Ukraine - Mr Schulz &apos;s in particular - have left me with a curious impression .
after listening to certain Members of this House over the past weeks , one could be forgiven for thinking that the European Union took consistent steps to establish , support and guide the democracy movement in Ukraine .
it would be a fine thing if this had been the case , yet in actual fact it appeared on occasion as though the EU &apos;s high representatives were almost afraid of so much movement and so much lively and animated democracy , even during the mass demonstrations .
I believe that lessons must be learnt from these experiences in Ukraine , and not only by the Members of this House , but also by the diplomats of the European Union and of the nation states .
Europe &apos;s security is also dependent on the situation in its neighbouring countries .
this is something I have heard very frequently in recent weeks , yet it is not only our security and our well @-@ being that is always at stake .
if we are serious about the European values that we often invoke , the authoritarian and dictatorial systems around us must not be tolerated or accepted , regardless of our own interests .
at a time of so many changes for the better in Ukraine , which we may have helped a little towards the end , even though we did far too little , we must be aware how problematic is the situation of the Belarussian people and their freedom , and we must also discuss Russia .
it must not be said that President Putin and Russia are the same thing , as Russia has the &apos; Memorial &quot; movement and a very strong freedom movement , and this is something that must influence our diplomatic relations with Russia and our policy towards it .
- Mr President , a few days ahead of the abolition of the existing quotas on the international textiles and clothing trade , there is great concern over the future of thousands of companies and of more than 2.5 million workers concentrated mainly in Southern European countries .
this sector has already shed more than 1 million jobs in the last ten years .
I regret that the debate we requested on this extremely important issue has not taken place here in this House .
it is crucial not only that we announce possible measures to prevent companies from closing and millions of workers from losing their jobs , and to dispel the threat of poverty and social exclusion that hangs over large areas in which these companies are heavily concentrated , as is the case in Portugal ; it is also crucial that such measures be implemented .
hence the question that I ask once again : how will the impact of abolishing the quota system in those countries with the greatest concentration of the textiles and clothing industry be taken into account so that unemployment is prevented from getting any worse and so that this extremely important industry is defended ?
I ask you , Commissioner , to ensure that this question reaches the President of the Commission , who did not deign to hear our question .
Mr President , the EU Constitution and Turkey constitute a mismatch .
common citizenship and votes according to population figures will destroy the EU and give rise to dominance by the big powers .
I want to see a Europe in which large and populous nations are able to operate better in conjunction with small countries .
I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put its name to a communications strategy that will take money from opponents of the Constitution and make it available for propaganda on the part of adherents of the Constitution .
that is in conflict with the principle of equality and is thus illegal .
it is scandalous .
the money used for propaganda is there for the purpose of selling an undemocratic Constitution to the electorate .
it would be easier to ensure that the democracy we are losing in the Member States were at least combined in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people .
the EU Constitution makes it incredibly difficult to amend the contents of laws .
any change to one of the numerous policies locked into the Constitution must first be proposed by unelectable Commissioners in Brussels and then be based upon a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers or , if appropriate , a unanimous amendment to the Constitution .
that is not democracy .
the undemocratic Constitution is , then , to be sold through an undemocratic distribution of funds for the purpose of providing information , so that people do not manage to discover that , crucially , they are losing what is at the very heart of democracy : the right to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and , subsequently , a new policy .
whether the solution to the democratic deficit is a federal bicameral system or , alternatively , our vision of a Europe of democracies is something that people should discuss and should decide in free and fair referendums in all the Member States .
we rightly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elections .
should that not also apply to ourselves ?
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Barroso , we all refer frequently to a European identity .
Mr Barroso , you in particular have spoken a great deal about it before this House .
it has to be said , however , that a European identity must be built first and foremost on common security and on the common economic area .
there can be no question of a European identity if solidarity is lacking , and this lack manifests itself every time financial decisions are taken .
I would remind you that you referred to Parliament &apos;s key role in the drawing up of financial perspectives .
I wonder what will become of financial solidarity and the foundation for the building of a European identity if Parliament &apos;s proposal is cut from EUR 111 billion to EUR 106 billion ?
if we wish to build a European identity in the shape of a common area of security or a common economic area , we must be clear where the boundaries lie for EU enlargement .
given that Turkey &apos;s accession has been proposed , and that someone might well shortly propose the accession of Morocco , whilst overlooking Ukraine , it is likely to become impossible to speak of a European identity , as there will be no such identity .
Mr President , I wish to focus this debate on the ongoing work of the Council to prepare and initiate the external relations service in advance of ratification and adoption of the Constitution , for it is the Constitution which validates that service .
I have in my possession a letter from Mrs Wallström - the Vice @-@ President of the Commission , who is present this morning - confirming that the outcome of the debate on the Constitution should neither be presumed nor pre @-@ empted in any fashion .
yet that is precisely what is being done in this ongoing work on the new external relations service .
that is wrong .
as an individual Member of this House I protest against it .
either we acknowledge and accept the right of the nation @-@ states to determine the fate of the Constitution , its new institutions and its working apparatuses such as the foreign service , or we do not .
both the Council and the Commission arrogantly continue to work as if the Constitution was already approved .
it is a grave insult to and assault on the rights of nations and indeed the rights of people .
Mr President , there can be no doubt that the Council summit of 17 December will go down as a memorable date in the history of the construction of Europe .
I should , however , like to tell the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council that our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements , and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europe &apos;s borders lie .
we are of course in favour of Bulgaria &apos;s and Romania &apos;s accession to the EU , although these countries still need assisting in their efforts , and we are also in favour of Croatia &apos;s accession , as it will send a strong signal to the Balkans .
yet the situation is entirely different with regard to Turkey , a country which does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30 years .
Turkey punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide , and 97 % of its territory is outside Europe , which means that it has no right to join the European Union .
this is why we hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France .
Turkey &apos;s integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway , before it has even come into being , and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure .
would this be a sensible course of action ?
moving on to another , equally important , issue , I welcomed Mr Barroso &apos;s hard @-@ hitting remarks on the EU &apos;s Financial Perspective .
nevertheless , I remain concerned with regard to Europe &apos;s future .
without the necessary resources , the EU cannot seek to strengthen social cohesion or to support competitiveness , employment , research and environmental policy , and it will also be unable to give due consideration to the ageing of the population - in other words to adhere to the Lisbon strategy - or to continue the fight against terrorism , drugs and crime .
if we continue to operate with outmoded budgets , we will be unable to confront the challenges which await us , for example the explosive growth in Chinese competition .
the Council should therefore abandon its calls for a European budget set at 1 % , as otherwise Europe will no longer be able to guarantee the funding of its regional policy , which is close to the hearts of EU citizens .
we expect the Council to take into account the priorities I mentioned previously , and then to allocate the resources necessary to achieve our goals .
we should not forget that Europe cannot be built without the contribution of every individual and every European citizen .
Europe should export its values to the rest of the world , but it should also respect the men and women who enable it to exist .
unfortunately , I fear that the decisions taken on 17 December will be incomprehensible to many of our fellow citizens .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the Council is discussing the accessions of Croatia , Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey .
I should like to encourage you , when dealing with Croatia , to take a tough stance where cooperation with the International Criminal Court is concerned , because without that cooperation , it is irresponsible to make a serious start with Croatia .
persevere !
with regard to Romania , can you guarantee that we keep the requirements for that country strict ?
that is to say : no accession as long as Romania does not meet the criteria in the areas of human rights and corruption , among others , even if that means that Romania joins the EU after Bulgaria .
I will now turn to Turkey .
would I be quoting the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Balkenende , correctly if I said : no second @-@ class status , such as a privileged partnership , and no end date ?
is that still your position now ?
are you also prepared to say : no membership at the end of the negotiations if the human rights violations persist ?
will you apply zero tolerance ?
incidentally , with regard to the secret ballot which we are threatening to hold today about Turkey , I am left with a feeling that this would be to deceive the public .
I hope we will not need to resort to that .
over the past few months , you have held a debate about standards and values .
should you not have made this concrete by applying it , for example , to an issue such as Romania or Turkey , in the spirit of the French philosopher who said : ?
why not ? otherwise , it will remain a little theoretical .
does the arms embargo against China not fit perfectly in the framework of the debate about standards and values ?
this is not about Islam or Christianity , but about the communality of rule of law and democracy , and in this great diversity , it is about the values we have enshrined in our new Constitution .
I hope that that will remain the common denominator in the debate .
I have said to you before that my impression so far of the Dutch Presidency is that its ambitions and goals are not as clear as they need to be .
my question is whether that is a sign of insecurity or internal political contradictions within the Dutch Government , or are we still waiting for the big revelation ?
in that respect , the Council has quietly saddled us with very thorny issues on a few occasions .
I will for a moment forget this meeting place , Strasbourg , but I would refer to the inefficient Treaty of Nice and the agreements surrounding agricultural spending which were too expensive and produced too little change .
your ambitions concerning Lisbon , Kyoto in Europe and the world are wonderful and we support you in them , but the financial resources you are setting aside for them are pitiful .
this contradiction will , of course , not escape the public .
terrorism is once again the subject of lively debates at very high level .
only last week , all European chiefs of police were gathered here , telling us that , due to diverse national practices , the factual exchange of information is still not getting off the ground as it should .
there is still no person in charge at the heart of Europol , terrorists are still slipping through the net of the law and there is no harmonisation in the area of criminal investigation .
the question remains : is Gijs de Vries to keep coasting along , or will you allow him to do his job properly ?
finally , I wish you much success with your position on Turkey .
the line I would take would be : no second @-@ class status and no alternatives ; we are ready for real negotiations .
I hope that with this , together with Mr Balkenende , you will provide Mr Poettering &apos;s group with an adequate response .
Mr President , I consider that Turkey has to begin making the necessary steps to be acceptable to join the EU .
for this purpose , certain conditions must without fail be met , one of the most important of which is the recognition of Turkey &apos;s internal plurality .
breaking the fundamental Kemalist taboo is of vital importance .
recognising the linguistic , cultural and political rights of Kurdistan and other stateless national communities is crucial .
logically we Europeans want Turkey to comply with all of that , but we wonder whether we should not start by recognising our own intrinsic plurality .
what about all the pluri @-@ national states that keep denying their own diversity ?
in the particular case of Spain - a state that in theory acknowledges its own domestic plurality , but not always equality among all the different nations that make up that state - still more steps have to be taken .
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Government , Mr Miguel Angel Moratinos , presented a memorandum on 13 December on the official languages of the autonomous communities .
such a proposal does not imply , as we wanted , full recognition status for Catalan , Basque and Galician .
it does not give any recognition to Asturian or Aragonese .
this memorandum offers the chance of speaking in the European Parliament in Catalan , but always at 15 days &apos; notice .
how can I handle this if I do not know until the day before if I am to be given the chance to speak ?
when your Member States &apos; governments sincerely acknowledge their plurality , that will be the most powerful tool in working towards a more democratic Turkey , and in asking for a fundamental change to the way in which it is applying to join the European Union .
Mr President , my party and my political group hope that the European Council will decide to embark upon negotiations with Turkey concerning membership .
it is just as important to point out that Turkey has a very long way to go , especially when it comes to human rights , the situation regarding minorities , the Cyprus issue and union rights .
a great many legislative changes have occurred in Turkey , but it has to be realised that these are not matched by the reality on the ground and by changes in practice .
current Turkish legislation too is very deficient .
I can point to the new criminal law that still in practice makes it a criminal offence to mention the Armenian genocide in Turkey .
that is completely unacceptable , and to Turkey &apos;s discredit that it continues to deny this historical fact .
recognition of the genocide would open the way to normalisation for the Armenians in Turkey and also to the normalisation of relations with Armenia - something that is necessary if Turkey is to become a member of the EU .
Mr President , frequent allusions are made in this House to the continuing democratisation of Turkey , and yet we ourselves , who are supposed to vote on this issue , are taking our leave of democracy and transparency .
secret ballots are generally only held in this House on matters relating to Members , and it is entirely incomprehensible that such a ballot should be held on important political decisions on matters of principle .
who wants to hide , and from whom ?
are they hiding from the people of the Member States , the majority of whom - on the basis of rational argument - are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , or from the chairmen of their groups , out of fear of standing up for their convictions , whatever those convictions may be ?
this would mean that this House is merely imitating the Council &apos;s behaviour , and ultimately we will fall hostage to those who say that it is too late to say no .
it is by no means too late to do so .
if Turkey were to join the EU , Europe would fall into chaos .
this can be prevented if we are open and transparent in casting our &apos; no &quot; votes today .
Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , the Dutch Presidency has nearly come to an end .
it was , of course , not the easiest of times to lead Europe , but we had no choice .
it already had a late start , following the recess ; then there was the handicap of a newly @-@ elected Parliament that was starting to find its feet , and that was followed by the Commission which came about in fits and starts .
under this not terribly lucky star , the Netherlands still tried to set to work .
that is why I think that the Netherlands should count its blessings , because despite the short period of time , an awful lot got done , for example , with regard to the Hague Programme for internal security , the security of our citizens .
in that respect , Minister Donner , who is so often under fire in the Netherlands , has , together with his colleagues , done an excellent job .
Mr Eurlings has already said a few things about Turkey ; I do not propose to repeat them .
something I do have difficulty with and which I think merits a comment is the acceptance of Romania and Bulgaria acceding .
I think that we need to let the Council , the summit , know that the matter , particularly in relation to Romania , is certainly not done and dusted , because in that country , human rights , women &apos;s rights and children &apos;s rights are still being violated and corruption is still rampant .
in any event , all things being equal , I do not think it is all that certain that Parliament will say &apos; yes &quot; to it .
with the same thing in mind , I should also like to make a remark about Croatia .
it appears that there is much more reserve with regard to that country , and I would like to ask the Dutch Presidency whether that attitude would not stifle any initiatives .
finally , I turn to the Lisbon agenda , the ambitions of which should , of course , be measured against the funding that is being set aside for this purpose .
in my view , at the summit , the 1 % club should in any event ensure that the requirements for Lisbon and the question as to how social cohesion can be best achieved with the ten new Member States are examined more effectively .
ambitions and funding should tally with each other .
Mr President , at the Council summit at the end of this week , the Dutch Presidency will present its conclusions on the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ terrorist policy and anti @-@ drugs strategy .
it is imperative for the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ terrorist policy to allow cooperation to be stepped up effectively between Member States and with third countries .
in particular , we believe that Member States should enter into the necessary commitments with a view to implementing the action plan on the fight against terrorism , while sticking to the timetable for that action plan , and also enter into commitments with a view to eliminating the obstacles which certain national administrations are placing in the way of exchanges of information .
we must also allow Europol and Eurojust to provide European added value in the fight against terrorism by placing them at the centre of cooperation and exchanges of information between Member States .
we would however note that the fight against terrorism should maintain a balance between necessary security measures , on the one hand , and respect for fundamental rights , on the other .
a political agreement on the EU &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy has already been reached within the Council , and merely needs to be adopted officially at the Council summit on 16 @-@ 17 December .
I believe it to be unacceptable that the Council has once again failed to wait for the European Parliament &apos;s opinion , and that it refused to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs of progress made in its own negotiations when the parliamentary committee was discussing the very same issue .
furthermore , we hope that a fairer approach will be adopted to issues of asylum and immigration , above all in order to ensure that the rights of every individual are respected and that responsibilities are shared .
finally , I should like to take this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that the Hague programme made no provision for measures to be taken in instances where Member States do not transpose legislation or instruments relating to justice and home affairs .
this is one of the shortcomings of the most recent multiannual programme .
- Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Commission , I would like to start by congratulating the Dutch Presidency on its work .
I have here the final draft of the conclusions and I must say that you have done a very good job .
with regard to enlargement , I wish to start by highlighting positively the paragraphs of the conclusions relating to the imminent accession of Romania and Bulgaria and to emphasise that the accession of these two countries is creating a new geopolitical reality .
consequently , I consider it very important - as you mention in the conclusions - that the relevant agreements and treaties be signed early on in 2005 .
with regard to the case of Turkey , a great deal has of course been said .
I , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , will insist on keeping paragraph 20 of the draft conclusions which I have before me , because it deals with the question of the peaceful resolution of differences with neighbouring countries .
I would ask you to examine very seriously the inclusion of a paragraph on Cyprus , by which I mean the withdrawal of the Turkish forces and , of course , recognition of the Republic of Cyprus .
I would also like to make a couple of positive remarks on what you have to say about the financial perspectives .
it is very important that we resolve the problem of the financial perspectives because , as you say , the financial perspectives and how they are addressed will give an enlarged Europe the tool to deal with future challenges , and I welcome the fact that you are talking of the need for prudence .
to close , I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism , but I wish to draw the Presidency &apos;s attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraphs .
it is a complicated issue , a very serious issue .
it is here to stay , we shall face new challenges every time and the Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission will therefore need to cooperate closely in order to combat this phenomenon .
Mr President , this has been a difficult year .
it started for me with a letter bomb exploding in my office .
since then we have had the Madrid bombings .
I would hope that at this time of the year our thoughts are with the victims and their families .
outside the European Union there was the tragedy of Beslan , and then today &apos;s bus siege in Greece .
all this reinforces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolute priority for the EU but , as a number of colleagues have already pointed out , that needs real action .
far too often cooperation among our police , judicial and intelligence services is cooperation in name only .
even a short conversation with anybody who works for Europol would reinforce that .
Member States have to deliver on their promises .
we need action , not words .
the same applies to the economic agenda .
Member States have to be called to account by the presidency for the things they have promised to do .
in particular , we have to get much more investment into people .
we particularly need to deliver on the active labour market policies that Mr Wim Kok has reported on in the past .
too many people in the European Union are inactive .
we are far too prepared to pay people to be on the scrap heap .
we need much more proactive policies to make work pay , and that includes more childcare and more education and training .
we cannot simply write people off as being unemployable .
sound finances are the basis of a good economy and therefore we are right to review the budget .
as my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said , it must not be some sort of mathematical exercise .
we have to look at what we do .
what is the added value in doing something at European level ?
what is the best way of getting value for money for our citizens ?
at the same time , we always have to remember that solidarity is the cornerstone of the European Union .
you remove that cornerstone and you undermine the very foundations of the Union .
that is why this debate on finances is vital to the future of the European Union .
I would like to comment on the accession process of two neighbouring countries .
in the case of Croatia , we have a well @-@ prepared nation and country with European traditions working toward admission to the European Union .
as Croatians lived under the same form of government as Hungarians for over 800 years , 400 years of which as part of the Habsburg Monarchy , their commitment to the legal system , and their social and economic organisation is very similar to those of Hungary .
I went to Zagreb several times in the 1990s , I have also visited it lately , and concluded that based on their institutional preparation on the levels of government , economy and parliament , their hopes for negotiations are as justified as Hungary &apos;s were at the beginning of negotiations in 1998 .
Croatia &apos;s economic and social preparedness also makes it possible for the negotiations for accession not only to be opened in the spring of 2005 , but also to be concluded , regardless of other factors and other countries , such as Turkey .
this may also serve as a positive message to other nations and governments of the West Balkans who are headed towards Europe .
Romania &apos;s accession will be a major step in the evolution of Europe , as a European nation composed of various European peoples , including two million Hungarians , will join .
it will be a win @-@ win situation for both foreign policy and the internal market .
being accepted by Europe will hopefully help Romanians not only to discover the advantages of their diversity but also to preserve them , contrary to their current policies .
the preservation of European solidarity also includes paying attention to the impact that the expansion has on those Member States that comprise the borders of the European Union , such as Austria was this year .
a monitoring system operating on a more regular basis , that is biannually , needs to be established to ensure that commitments are followed through .
in the case of Romania , the functioning of the community system is of key importance , and in order to prove this , it is enough to consider environmental protection , the policy of competition or areas made vulnerable by internal considerations such as animal health , customs , or excise tax .
if screening , that involves the European Parliament , reveals deficits in these fields a few years before and after accession , then EU resources must be mobilised for the necessary institutional development even at the cost of other goals .
should this fail as well , then - let us face it - specific sanctions will have to be applied .
as Bulgaria ( which has shown promising progress ) and Romania should be subject to individual consideration , I believe it is necessary to separate their accession processes and if necessary , to stipulate a flexible accession date to Romania , whose membership I very much look forward to .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , as rapporteur for Croatia I should like to say a few words today on a country to which little reference has been made , even though it is to be hoped that the European Council summit will see a positive and important decision taken on it .
although it is a fact that every rapporteur treats the country for which he is responsible a little like his or her own child , I do believe that this is not merely a matter of taking a decision on Croatia , but of taking a decision on a whole region .
particularly given the stability and security concerns that have already been touched upon , it is vital that the Council &apos;s decision on it should be favourable .
this would be a sign that every country in the Balkans , if it makes the appropriate efforts and meets the criteria , has a chance of becoming a Member State of the European Union , something that was recently promised in Thessaloniki .
I believe that both the former and the present Croatian Governments , with their differing political orientations , have done a great deal to prepare themselves and to move towards meeting the criteria to which we must pay close attention in every instance .
there is however an obstacle that is undoubtedly of great significance , namely cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague .
it is claimed that there is such cooperation , but it has been neither full nor adequate .
demands have been made , and rightly so , that close attention be paid to whether every country - both Croatia and the other countries , above all Serbia - cooperates with The Hague in this respect .
yet I believe that in principle , and as a matter of priority , the Council should acknowledge the positive steps undertaken by Croatia , and that this should also be reflected in the Council &apos;s decision .
I also hope that the Government will not merely issue declarations , but will genuinely take every possible measure to bring the indicted general Ante Gotovina before the Tribunal in The Hague .
in addition to taking such measures , it should also destroy the networks that perhaps still exist and support him , and it should ensure that they are genuinely destroyed .
finally , Mr President , I believe that Ante Gotovina , if he is the patriot he claims to be , should not take his country hostage .
he must give himself up to the Tribunal in The Hague , as it would be a real shame if the fate of a country as important as Croatia were to depend on the decision of a single man not to surrender to justice .
I therefore hope that , in view of all these circumstances , a positive sign will be given to The Hague .
- Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that everyone - citizens and politicians alike - is living through an historic era , because the decision which the European Council is expected to take on accession negotiations with Turkey will be a landmark for Turkey itself , the European Union and our region as a whole .
public opinion has not concerned itself to such an extent with any other candidacy .
there were no such differences between the Member States or between the political parties , no such pressure was brought to bear by the United States , no such concerns or fears were expressed , no such variety of questions was raised so seriously at every discussion table .
the European Parliament is having trouble finding its political direction on this issue , not because of any weakness on its part , but because of the complexity and seriousness of the issue .
arguments have been expressed for and against the accession of Turkey to saturation point over recent days .
we have one common denominator : we are calling on the European Council to defend the dignity of the European Union ; to respect Turkey , but also to respect the values which unite the peoples of Europe .
no can be used as an alibi for setting aside our values or for adjusting them to Turkish demands , be it in connection with the spirit or the letter of the Copenhagen criteria or with the recognition of all 25 Member States of the European Union , by which you will understand that I mean the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus .
this is not only a moral choice , but also the best basis for a sustainable policy which will safeguard our cohesion and will inspire respect for and confidence in the Union in its citizens who , in all events , expect clear justification for the decisions of the European Council and a public dialogue which , unfortunately , has not yet taken place , with substance and depth on the future of euro @-@ Turkish relations .
the other issue I wanted to mention is that the Council should , at long last , draw up a long @-@ term plan for our foreign relations with decisiveness , cohesion , properly coordinated objectives and reliable financing .
in particular , I want to refer to our relations with the countries of the Balkans and our partner Mediterranean countries which make up our living space .
this framework includes the role which we need to play in the resolution of the Middle East crisis , in this new era which is at long last now starting for the region ; it would appear that the goal posts are shifting and that there are margins for intervention and change .
Mr President , Hungarian citizens voted for membership of the European Union with an overwhelming majority of 83 per cent .
they did so in the belief that after many lost decades Hungarian society could become a part of the common European social model , including strong social policies for everybody , real improvements in environmental matters , free movement of labour and solidarity for common standards among the 25 nations .
that is the goal of this huge European project .
besides a permanent and almost endless enlargement , we should not forget the original idea of deepening the existing Union by the approximation and harmonisation of our standards of living , infrastructure and labour market .
if we are deeply concerned about the ageing population and the lack of labour forces , why do some Member States close their labour market even to the skilled workers of other EU Member States ?
the new financial framework does not seem to answer some of the basic questions - at least as far as I am concerned .
is 1.24 per cent of the GNI of our Member States enough to establish a common social model for us ?
is it enough to cover the expenses of the brave environmental initiative Natura 2000 , designed to save our nature and biodiversity ?
if we are so proud of our cultural values , as has been mentioned in this debate , why do we spend only one per cent of our budget on culture , education , etc . ?
if 1.24 per cent of GNI is such a low amount to build up a common European social , environmental and cultural model , why are some Member States even considering reducing this amount ?
finally , does the Council believe in a strong social and cultural union and is it ready to provide the basic financial sources to create it ?
Mr President , the debate on the Financial Perspective involves many different issues .
the debate on how large the EU &apos;s income should be should never conceal the importance of how we prioritise our expenditure .
we must give greater priority to the expenditure supporting the development of the new knowledge @-@ based society and dare to provide smaller subsidies to those parts of our economy that are too large and that belong to the economy of a different era .
the Lisbon process will of course be the most important element .
what the Commission and the Council must do is not just talk about lofty goals but also propose practical measures that increase competition , especially within those sectors associated with the knowledge @-@ based society .
what is at issue is how we are to extend competition within the fields not only of education and health care but also of other areas of our society so that , in Europe , we might obtain the best businesses .
there is one issue that makes the summit we are now facing especially historic , and that is the issue of Turkey .
a &apos; no &quot; decision , or a means of delaying the membership process , would of course have consequences of various kinds .
we should in that case be leaving the field free for forces and ideals other than those for which the EU stands .
the EU &apos;s basic task is to create safety and security and to bridge differences instead of creating new lines of demarcation .
this means that we must ask ourselves the question : will we enjoy greater safety and security with Turkey rooted firmly in the fundamental values of the EU and of Europe , just as we are that much safer and more secure as a result of the enlargement that has taken place this year and just as we shall also be safer and more secure if the EU can be extended to the Balkans ?
that issue is ultimately about the respect we perceive for the work done by the EU .
the reason why other countries want to join the EU is the EU &apos;s success in increasing safety and security .
this is an important reason why the Council must take the historic decision to agree to commencing negotiations .
in my brief contribution , I shall deal with just one topic and that is the topic of enlargement .
we have been witnesses to an unprecedented historical enlargement with ten new countries .
I myself come from one of the new countries and I think we can all agree that , after just the first seven months , we can say that enlargement has been a success .
it has been a success for Europe , for the &apos; old Member States &quot; and for the new countries .
the process of the historic enlargement of Europe is not complete , however .
we have talked in this House and we shall talk again this afternoon about Romania and about Bulgaria .
I am convinced that both Bulgaria and Romania are well on the way to joining the European Union and I believe that , with the European Union &apos;s help , they will be able to make a successful accession into our Community in 2007 .
we are also going to talk about Croatia . Croatia definitely plays a key role in the Western Balkans .
I should like the Council to give a clear signal to Croatia that accession talks should begin with that country , provided , of course , that the appropriate Copenhagen criteria and the requirements of the International Criminal Court in The Hague have been met .
Croatia can , I believe , play a significant role in the Western Balkans and could be a future model for Serbia , Bosnia , Montenegro , Macedonia and the other countries of the Western Balkans .
we spoke here yesterday , and we shall again today , about Turkey .
I should like the Council to remember its obligations , to remember Europe &apos;s promises and to begin accession negotiations with Turkey .
given that we have awarded that country the status of candidate country , I feel that we owe it to Turkey to open negotiations .
this will also support the process of reform there , which has been pursued successfully for the last two years .
- Mr President , there is something of which I would like to remind , our assembled Heads of State or Government , and that is that they are elected by the people .
they were elected to represent , in a European context , the interests of their people , and thus of their nation states .
they are only the first among equals , no more than that , and they bear a tremendous responsibility for our common future .
one would normally assume that these very Heads of State or Government represent the will of the people , but , right now , that clearly seems not to be the case where existential questions are concerned .
let us take my own country , the Federal Republic of Germany , as an example .
there has been a new survey on the issue of Turkey .
only 15 % of Germans are in favour of Turkey gaining full membership of the European Union , 60 % of Germans support that special form of cooperation that we call a privileged partnership , 22 % are generally against cooperation between Turkey and the European Union and only 3 % expressed no opinion .
in spite of this , what our Chancellor put to the Council was his own party @-@ political opinion .
he is the strongest supporter of Turkey &apos;s accession , of this great madness .
is that right ?
is it responsible ?
no , it is not .
we see exactly the same situation in other Member States .
the Council must be aware that the decision now to be taken regarding the start of accession negotiations with Turkey is not just about the further enlargement of the EU .
it is an existential question for the European Union , for the political Union which is of the utmost importance for us and for the preservation of peace in the future .
after all , our history reflects the history of Europe , and shows how difficult it is to get along with all these small , headstrong European nations .
history also shows us that if we expand too much now , as did so many other former empires which grew too fast , there is the danger of our overreaching ourselves and bringing about our own downfall and ruination .
if our own Heads of State or Government now give Turkey a starting date for negotiations , even though the criteria have not been met , and even though we know that we cannot manage to integrate this enormous country , they will be gambling away our future .
however harsh this might sound , Turkey is too big , too heterogeneous , too poor , and too populous .
we must not take that step .
we have expanded much in the past year and three more countries are yet to join us .
we have to consolidate our position first .
we have to get to grips with each other and it is the example of German reunification that shows us how difficult that task is .
we have not managed it yet .
I appeal to our Heads of State or Government to be aware that they represent the will of the people , that they have to convey the will of the people to the outside world , and that the majority of the people of Europe , I am quite convinced , think : &apos; please be careful in making promises to Turkey .
we cannot afford it ! &quot;
- Mr President , I did not actually want to speak about Turkey yet again , for everything that there is to say about it has already been said , but Mrs Sommer has prompted me to speak .
everyone presents surveys that serve their purpose .
I know of surveys carried out in Germany which show that people have nothing against Turkey becoming a member of the EU .
I can only say that I would warn people against over @-@ dramatising and exaggerating the situation , as you have just done .
it is completely mistaken and inappropriate to tie Europe &apos;s existence and the survival of the European Union to Turkey &apos;s accession .
let ten years pass and wait until the negotiations are over , and maybe then Turkey will become the thirtieth member of a great Union with 500 million inhabitants .
so please let us remain calm ; let us keep a cool head and let there be less drama and emotion in this debate .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I too actually wanted to talk about an enlarged Europe .
I wanted to congratulate you on holding a series of conferences on European identity .
that was a very good and necessary thing to do .
we have to ask ourselves what it is that holds 450 million Europeans together , what it is that unites us all , from Estonia to Portugal , from Scotland to Greece , and , as we all know , the answer is : European values .
it is also the positive objectives the European Union has set itself : the commitment to peace , to freedom and to justice .
these are the things that unite us in Europe .
over the next two years in particular , during the process of ratifying the Constitution , it is especially important to convey these things and not to lose ourselves in points of detail .
I am therefore especially glad that , at the summit on Friday , under Points 66 and 67 of the Conclusions , you asked the Commission to put these matters at the forefront of its communication strategy .
I think that we can win the people over in this way - Commissioner Wallström is also doing good work in this regard - and so I would like to encourage you to decide in favour of this , as it is indeed necessary .
in this context , I also think that Points 69 and 52 , in which we affirm human rights , are very positive .
as it has already been agreed that there should be a European Human Rights Agency , it must now be set up .
Europe needs this instrument , and our values are important not only for our identity within the Union , but also for our authority in the world at large .
I therefore wish not only to congratulate you , but also to encourage you to push forward with these issues .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union , which has lasted for several months , will shortly come to an end .
I should like to congratulate all the Members of this House , myself included , on the wide @-@ ranging nature of the debate , and to express the hope that every other important decision will be preceded by a debate of such calibre .
during this debate , no fewer than four model positions on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union emerged .
the first is the traditional position , namely that negotiations should be opened , in all likelihood as early as next year , with the possibility of suspending them if it became apparent that problems or obstacles were being created by the Turkish side .
the second position is that of opening negotiations with the possibility of offering Turkey an alternative solution if such difficulties arose during these negotiations , namely a special , privileged partnership .
the third position consists of waiting until Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria in full , which amounts to imposing additional conditions given that the Copenhagen criteria have not been fully met .
finally , the fourth position is that of a special , privileged partnership .
I understand that Parliament &apos;s decision is to adopt the first model , or in other words to start negotiations next year without any other additional conditions , and I also understand that this is likely to be the Council &apos;s decision too .
it will be a decision of ground @-@ breaking importance , and a decision imposing a great responsibility on the Member States , the EU and the Council .
it will mean taking the first steps along a very demanding path .
conditions are set not only for the Turkish side , but also for the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
these conditions are all the more challenging , and this responsibility is all the more difficult to bear , because we are , so to speak , dealing with a child .
references have already been made to a marriage , but I prefer to use the example of a family with an adopted child .
in a certain sense , Turkey is an adopted child , and we should not forget that the responsibilities of the family and of the parents are particularly challenging when adopting a child .
I hope we are all fully aware of this , and that we will begin to put our European house in order .
- Mr President , of the various topics for debate at the forthcoming European Council - in addition to Turkey , which we have spoken about on a number of occasions - the topic of the fight against terrorism remains extremely important .
the Dutch Presidency &apos;s evaluation of the action programme of June 2004 is proof of this .
given that this is a threat to all of us , the most appropriate strategy is one that leads us to act together , bypassing national level and even the areas of internal justice and security .
indeed , the way to deal with terrorism today is entirely different from the 1970s and 80s .
the events of 11 September 2001 have ushered in a radical change in the area of security .
European countries have new responsibilities and new challenges , the urgency and seriousness of which was confirmed by 11 March .
in a globalised world , politics , diplomacy , internal security and defence must be combined to address these new types of threat .
security has become a global , indivisible concept , which today encompasses internal and external security and the support of third countries in the fight against terrorism .
the EU and its Member States must streamline their defence capacities and strengthen their channels of diplomatic cooperation , their information services and their legal and law enforcement coordination , in a genuine synergy of national and transnational policy .
as a Portuguese Member of this House , I wish to point out that my government - under the then Prime Minister , Mr Durão Barroso , who is now President of the Commission - transposed all Community legislation in the area of combating terrorism and took the operational measures needed to carry this out .
on the same subject , I should like to highlight the introduction of biometric data in passports , a measure that was only recently adopted by Parliament .
provided it is accompanied by essential precautions , this measure will serve to strengthen crime prevention and , in turn , to reinforce the citizens &quot; security , which is our primary objective .
on the eve of the European Council , the various speeches made in this House on this subject have shown that Parliament wishes to send out a clear message that this is the path that together we must relentlessly continue to follow .
as a representative of Estonia , herself the product of the recent enlargement , I welcome the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania yesterday , and the readiness to open negotiations with Croatia .
all the same , it is important to treat each candidate country separately according to progress made , not as a package .
second , the principle that every EU enlargement must be balanced by a strengthening of our internal dynamics and unity is important .
as my colleague Mr Pinheiro said , &apos; Turkey is a special case in the enlargement . &quot;
the opening of negotiations may be sanctioned provided all the Copenhagen criteria are clearly met , just as in the case of accession countries in the final round of negotiations .
this is not yet the case .
a fundamental question for governments , however , is the inconceivability of opening negotiations with a candidate whose military forces occupy the territory of an EU Member State , and which does not even recognise the existence of that state .
this position must be made unequivocally clear before the negotiations start .
this is fundamental and cannot just be recommendatory ; otherwise , the present ambiguity regarding the criteria will create a precedent whereby such accommodations in regard to large candidate countries may begin to repeat themselves .
this , however , will undermine the sense of security of other , smaller countries in the future .
I also call on the Commission to consider Ukraine &apos;s prospects for the future , because it is in Ukraine that the question of the EU &apos;s eastern border is being decided today .
yesterday a representative of the Ukrainian people was here - the Ukrainian Eurovision Song Contest winner Ruslana , who probably has a greater number of supporters than any Ukrainian politician .
her message was this : &apos; show me the room in this building where we could hand in Ukraine &apos;s accession application . &quot;
today there is no such room , but for those of us who support the democratic rebirth of Ukraine , it is our business to heed this message and to make sure that this room is found and made ready for use in the near future .
Mr President , today &apos;s debate about the European summit at the weekend has become a continuation of our discussion about Turkey , which we began on Monday evening , and which we will bring to a conclusion immediately after this debate , when we vote on the Eurlings Report .
it is a good thing that this House should devote a lot of time to the issue of Turkey &apos;s readiness to join the European Union .
that is what the public expects of this Parliament .
however , the people at home also expect us to base our debate and our decisions on a serious analysis of the facts , and it is in this regard that I have some doubts .
what has been said here today about Turkey &apos;s accession has little to do with the reality in that country .
the Dutch Presidency has expressly stated in the introduction that Turkey has fulfilled the political accession criteria , and thus is a democratic state under the rule of law , where basic rights , and especially the rights of minorities , are respected .
the President of the Commission has obviously read the most recent Commission Progress Report more closely .
he speaks instead about the fact that Turkey meets the political criteria .
this apparently means , among other things , that torture is no longer systematically used in Turkish prisons , and that women can hope to one day have the same rights as men in Turkish society .
it seems that a lot of my fellow @-@ Members in this House are basing their opinions on this principle of hope - particularly all those who are to the left of centre and who , I suspect , will be in the majority .
Mr Schulz , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , and others , have told us that a Turkey that is secular and respects the rule of law would strengthen Europe &apos;s community of values .
that is true .
a secular Turkey which respects the rule of law would indeed strengthen Europe &apos;s community of values .
the Turkey of today , though , is still a long way from these values .
if we do not admit this to ourselves , we are not only being dishonest with the public , but are also endangering the stability and security that has hitherto been achieved in the European Union .
let us not proceed further down the road of automatic acceptance of accession , or at least not where and when the facts do not really justify it .
. Mr President , I am grateful for the remarks made by many and of which I have taken good note in preparation for the European Council that is due to be held on Thursday and Friday .
let me start with the fundamental debate raised by a number of Members of this House , that being the debate about what the European Union is , what Europe is .
I am very much at one with a number of Members , of whom Mr Watson was the first and most outspoken , who state that the European Union is not a religious community .
I am also in agreement with Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , who pointed out that Europe is not a cultural community either .
as Mr Schulz and others stated , Europe , the European Union , is a community of values .
European integration is a political project rather than a religious one .
in that connection , Mrs Uca made the helpful remark that , with Turkey in mind , that conclusion can also be a bridge to Islam and indeed , we can use it to illustrate that Europe is a political and not a religious project .
conversely , Turkey can use it to demonstrate that a country that is Islamic for the most part can also be a democratic and functioning constitutional state .
some of you , including Mr Maaten and Mr Lehne , have spoken in explicit terms and with appreciation about the series of conferences on the nature of Europe and the essence of the values we share .
one of the important lessons that we can draw from the discussion about European values and European identity is that we must , in fact , be careful about focusing on European identity .
we all know , from the past century , what the adverse effects can be of an identity that has been imposed from above .
we also realise that in terms of shared European values , many of those are , in fact , universal values , and we want them to be exactly that .
despite this , there are discernable European traits with regard to the way in which we apply those values , how we can invoke them and how we organise them .
there are definitely specific European accents that are evident in those values , one important example being tolerance .
this brings me to the enlargement debate , which attracted many speakers , starting with the debate about Turkey .
we held that debate yesterday and concluded that , because of the concerns about it , we will , in time , need to clearly demonstrate the huge advantages of the possibility of Turkey joining .
Mr Schulz mentioned security as one of the advantages .
Mr Watson noted that Turkey sufficiently meets the criteria , and that is also , in agreement with the Commission &apos;s conclusion , the presidency &apos;s position following the entry into force of the six laws .
Mr Eurlings and others pointed out once again that it is important to maintain pressure on Turkey in relation to the developments needed in that country in respect of human rights , religious freedom and other political criteria .
that is precisely why the presidency has decided , based on the Commission proposals , to come up with a new framework for future negotiations about accession .
that framework allows for more pressure to be brought to bear and offers more guarantees for smooth progress .
this so @-@ called &apos; emergency stop option , &quot; in other words an option of suspension , offers guarantees in relation to the sensitive political criteria .
it is understandable that a number of Members of this House should , once again , have raised the issue of Cyprus .
Mr Barroso included it in his introduction , and Mr Adamou and Mr Dimitrakopoulos alluded to it too .
I should like to reiterate the Dutch Presidency &apos;s key position on this score in the preparations of the Council that will be held at the end of this week .
we do indeed want Turkey to recognise the fact that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and is one of the Twenty @-@ Five countries .
we want to bring this about by getting Turkey to sign the protocol to the association agreement .
Mr van den Berg has asked specifically whether the presidency can confirm that the intention is that no accession date be set .
I can confirm very emphatically that that is indeed the presidency &apos;s intention .
another question , related to the political criteria , was whether the presidency can confirm that Turkey will not join unless it is ready .
here too , I can definitely confirm that to be the case .
finally in connection with Turkey , I should like to raise the sensitive issue which will be discussed presently in Parliament , namely the so @-@ called open @-@ endedness of the negotiations .
once again , Mr van den Berg asked specifically what the presidency &apos;s intention is .
let me make it clear once more : the presidency &apos;s intention is that these should be accession negotiations with accession in mind .
that is my first point .
my second is that , following on from the Commission &apos;s comments , it is an open @-@ ended process .
there is no guarantee as to the outcome . the third element is that European cohesion must in any event remain sufficiently guaranteed , but the Dutch Presidency &apos;s understanding for Thursday &apos;s and Friday &apos;s conclusions is that there is indeed no Plan B .
since we will be discussing Romania and Bulgaria later on , I will now confine myself to a few fundamental remarks in response to questions in this respect .
Mr Watson and Mr Becsey , among others , have insisted on a separate approach for Bulgaria on the one hand and Romania on the other .
in that connection , it is useful to point out that , as you know , no distinction can be drawn in the agreement , but one can , if necessary , be drawn with regard to the date of accession , because the option has been introduced and agreed , if there is cause for this , to decide to suspend accession of the country in question for one year at most .
that is also the response to the questions by Mr Eurlings , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten and Mr Kirkhope , who are still deeply concerned about the situation in Romania and emphasise the importance of continuing to bring maximum pressure to bear on the developments there .
I share that view , and that is why we in the Presidency have proposed that the Council should conclude that we want additional provisions in terms of monitoring and specific benchmarks for Romania , coupled with a potential sanction , if necessary , of one year &apos;s suspension .
a number of Members have made reference to Croatia , and , as it is not a separate item on the agenda , I think that , despite the uproar in the Chamber , it would be useful to give you a precise response to this .
Mr Pinheiro and Mr Becsey have indicated that Croatia has made much progress in moving closer to Europe , and that it is a European country .
I should like to emphatically endorse both of these statements .
much progress has been made and the country is located in the centre of Europe .
in addition , Mr Watson , Mr van den Berg and Mr Swoboda were right to point out that full cooperation with the ICTY ( International Criminal Tribune for the Former Yugoslavia ) is of vital importance .
I would say to Mr Swoboda and to Mr Becsey that it would , of course , be good if we could make that positive step , also bearing in mind the fulfilment of Croatia &apos;s role as a model in the Balkans .
I agree with Mr Swoboda that we must try to have a positive decision .
that is the presidency &apos;s commitment and that means that indeed , we can decide in favour of opening negotiations at the beginning of next year , provided that these are specifically linked to full cooperation with the ICTY .
another important point that many of you have raised is that of combating terrorism , the major significance of which has also been underlined by President Barroso and Mr Pinheiro , among others .
in addition , Mr Watson , Mrs Malmström and Mrs Buitenweg were right , in my view , to point out the importance of striking a balance between fighting terrorism and fundamental rights .
I agree with them , and I think that Mr Maarten was right to point out that we , in the Hague Programme , have demonstrated the Council &apos;s desire to preserve that balance .
Mr Eurlings specifically asked about ways of banning organisations .
he will be aware that that is a responsibility , a competence , of the Member States , but we will definitely ensure that information about it is exchanged between them .
Mr Eurlings , and others , see the exchange of information as crucial to the fight against terrorism .
that is the cornerstone of this presidency , and is also included in the Council &apos;s agenda for Thursday and Friday .
over these past six months , we have made concrete progress in making it easier to exchange criminal records , collating intelligence and in relation to situation centres and threat analyses that can be carried out in those centres .
as you know , we will be asking the Commission to table a more detailed proposal for the exchange of information , as provided for in the Hague Programme .
at the request of a number of Members , I am happy to inform you specifically of the European Council &apos;s intention , next Thursday and Friday , to decide whether , in principle , to appoint a European human rights ambassador .
many in this House spoke about the financial perspective .
in his introductory remarks , Mr Barroso mentioned the importance of added value where the multi @-@ annual budget and budget discipline are concerned , and he had good reason to do so , but he also expressed his concern , which was subsequently given greater emphasis by others , about the 1 % approach and the importance of sufficient funding for Europe &apos;s priorities .
it is therefore useful to indicate the Council &apos;s position on this score .
we subscribe to many of the priorities mentioned here , but it remains important in every financial discussion , in addition to the priorities , to determine the posteriorities , and not only count the priorities .
that is exactly what we in the Presidency have done with what we call our &apos; building blocks &quot; approach , in which we have tried to draft a summary and compile posteriorities rather than only priorities .
I can reassure a number of Members who are worried about what is going to happen on Thursday and Friday .
Mrs Grossetête feared that we would be taking a decision about 1 % which would not be understood by the citizens .
the Council has not adopted a position on the 1 % , let that be very clear .
based on the Commission proposals , which are still the guiding principle - because , after all , the new Parliament quite rightly values them greatly - the Council has simply outlined the positions of the Member States , both priorities and posteriorities , and it is on those that we will be basing our decisions .
I am keen to concur with Mr Watson in his concerns about the financial accountability and his concern about the fact that , for the tenth time now , the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about expenditure .
during our presidency , we have taken steps to improve that situation by means of single audits , and we will discuss this in more detail in the spring .
as far as the EU &apos;s external policy is concerned , I think we have experienced a historic moment , one that was mentioned by many .
Mr Schulz was the first one to speak about it , and was very frank , as was Mrs Napoletano .
that moment had to do with Ukraine .
I think that the stance that we - the European Parliament , the Commission and Council - have taken has demonstrated our ability to speak with one voice where external policy is concerned .
in my view , that is a very important step in the progress we managed to bring about in the democratisation process in Ukraine .
it is also a very important step toward speaking with one voice in external policy .
that is a first step and we intend to take more of them on the basis of the new Treaty .
I can be brief about the next subject , namely the Lisbon strategy , which was raised by a number of Members , including Mr Maaten , Mr Kirkhope and Mr Titley .
you know that this subject is not on this Council &apos;s agenda , as it will be raised in the spring .
however , we will persevere , and it is true that the implementation of the Lisbon strategy is one of the key components .
as Mr Maaten and Mr Kirkhope stated , it is also true that deregulation and the reduction of the administrative burden is crucial for our competitiveness in the world .
I turn , finally , to the issue of public involvement and the importance of transparency and openness .
what I should like to say to Mrs Buitenweg with regard to openness is that we have , during our presidency , tried to create more openness in the Council meetings wherever possible .
in addition , a unique meeting took place in Amsterdam involving all European Affairs ministers .
the whole of this meeting was public , as was an informal industrial meeting .
I should like to end on an optimistic note .
Mr Maaten congratulated the presidency on promoting the public &apos;s involvement by means of good communication .
I am not certain whether it has anything to do with that , but according to the latest Eurobarometer survey , there is an increase in the public &apos;s positive involvement .
the percentage of citizens who say that EU membership is a good thing has risen from 48 % to 56 % .
that is not enough , but is nevertheless a big step forward and I should like to end on this happy note .
in any case , I would like to thank you for your attention .
Mr President , on behalf of President Barroso and the whole of the Commission , I wish to thank you for this debate , which has provided us with many valuable and constructive proposals and viewpoints .
the debate has also reflected the EU &apos;s ambitious and demanding agenda over the next few years .
I have only one single thing to add to what has already been said by President Barroso and the Presidency of the Council .
this has to do with an aspect of the Commission &apos;s proposal concerning Turkey .
parallel to the negotiations on which the Commission wishes to embark with Turkey , a cultural dialogue is also proposed .
this will serve as a channel for the anxiety and prejudices that are to be found , as well as for the real differences that exist between the EU and Turkey , and will ensure that we can overcome all these by embarking upon a bilateral dialogue in civil society too .
that is something I believe is very important if we are also to investigate and resolve a number of the arguments put forward in this House .
these often have to do with a fear of what is viewed as unknown or frightening .
remember that such fear is felt on both sides .
I believe this to be an important instrument in the dialogue .
the concerns in question are of course of ten years &quot; duration when it comes to the issue of Turkey .
it is also important to ask ourselves some fundamental questions in the run @-@ up to this important decision .
what is it that can bring about the strongest forces in favour of a secular Turkey characterised by legal certainty ?
what would be the risks and the effects of signalling a change to the EU &apos;s political direction when it comes to embarking upon negotiations with Turkey ?
I hope , indeed am convinced , that the debate that has been conducted in this House today will be a sound basis for the discussions that are to be conducted by the Council and that will continue to be conducted in the Commission too .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
the next item is the vote .
Mr Watson has the floor for a point of order .
which Rule of Procedure are you invoking , Mr Watson ?
Mr President , I rise because in ten years of service in this House I cannot recall an instance similar to that regarding today &apos;s vote on the Eurlings report ...
I would ask you to obey the Rules of Procedure and indicate which Rule you are invoking .
I apologise , Mr President , I should like to make a point of order under Rule 162 .
as I was saying , in ten years &apos; service I cannot recall a similar instance to that with which we are faced today .
we consistently demand of the Council and the Commission openness and transparency in political decisions ...
... and it is an extraordinary practice for Members of this House to ask for a secret ballot on a political decision under Rule 162 , which is designed for the appointment of individuals .
how can we be accountable to our electors ?
how can we defend ourselves against charges of shame and hypocrisy ?
Mr President , I urge you to face down this ramshackle coalition of cowards and autocrats , ...
... to declare a secret vote inadmissible on the grounds that it is unworthy of this House and to seek an early change to the Rules of Procedure to clarify this Rule .
Mr President , I have risen to speak on the basis of Rule 162 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of our Rules of Procedure .
as Mr Watson has just pointed out , and to pick up on the remarks made by Mr Poettering , it is the European Union &apos;s duty to take the historic decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey .
there are those who are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , and I have great respect for these people .
there are also those who are in favour of such an accession , and I have great respect for them too .
yet I know of no one whom I respect who lacks the courage to say what they think about Turkey .
I would ask Mr Poettering to make a public statement on whether he is for or against the secret ballot which will take place in this House today .
is he personally for or against the secret ballot ?
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , you may ask the honourable Members to calm down , but I must remind you that you are speaking on a point of order .
so please restrict yourself to that .
I would ask that those Members who have signed this resolution with the far right to withdraw their signatures , as the resolution is beneath their logic and their intelligence .
I call on all those with any self @-@ respect to withdraw their signatures and to vote ...
Mr President , we are familiar with Rule 162 , and we also see from the voting list that 147 Members are apparently invoking Rule 162 to justify holding a secret ballot on various tabled amendments and in the final vote .
I would therefore like to make my group &apos;s position on Rule 162 clear : the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would prefer a vote by roll call , for we believe that Europe &apos;s citizens have a right to know how Members of the European Parliament are voting on this key issue .
in our view , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in this House is incapable of adhering to a coherent and unified line .
most of the 147 signatures come from this group , and I would like to thank the former Belgian Prime Minister , Mr Dehaene , for informing the Members of this group in unequivocal terms that while this solution may be acceptable from a legal perspective , politically it is completely unacceptable .
it is becoming clear that the point of order relates to the application of Rule 162 on secret ballots , in accordance with the request made .
Mr President , firstly , this is one Rule that I did not draft .
secondly , let me underline - before you make your ruling - the significance of the word &apos; may &apos; .
rule 162 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure says that voting &apos; may &apos; also take place by secret ballot , if requested by at least one @-@ fifth of the Members .
it does not say &apos; shall &apos; .
the previous paragraph says &apos; shall &apos; concerning voting on nominations of individuals .
there is a clear difference between the two cases of &apos; may &apos; and &apos; shall &apos; ...
Mr Corbett , we must respect the Rules of Procedure .
I realise that you are extremely knowledgeable on the subject , but I have not asked you for advice .
I take good note of your opinion and I will take it into account .
ladies and gentlemen , please only raise genuine points of order .
otherwise , this debate will go on forever .
Mr President , without wishing to offer unwanted advice , I should like to make a suggestion , namely , that the request made by a number of Members be put to the House .
Parliament would then be able to decide whether or not it is in favour of holding a secret ballot .
you have made a proposal to organise our work .
the Presidency takes good note of that , but our work is regulated by the Rules of Procedure and they provide us with sufficient guidance on how to proceed .
Mr President , I just wanted to say that according to my reason - if not to the Rules of Procedure - I am against the secret ballot and ask colleagues from my Group - or some of them at least - to withdraw their signatures .
ladies and gentlemen , this is not a debate on whether those who have signed have been right to do so or whether they should not sign .
I am only giving the floor for points of order and I would ask you to respect that .
opinions on whether it is good or bad to sign or not to sign , on whether Members should vote one way or another , may be very interesting , but they have no place at this point in the procedure .
accordingly , if a point of order turns out not to be one , the President will cut off the speaker .
- Mr President , I do not intend to take your job from you or to give you advice .
however , even if a request for a vote by roll call has been made , under Rule 162 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure the request for a secret ballot shall take priority over the request for a vote by roll call .
Mr President , all that I am asking is for you to implement the provisions of Rule 162 ( 3 ) , under which one fifth of Members of Parliament may call for a secret ballot .
I should like to remind Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , and you , Mr President , that the aim of this is to safeguard our utmost priority , namely freedom of conscience and expression .
the debate , Mr President ...
Mr President , I invoke the same article as Mr Wurtz .
the right to a secret ballot is a traditional minority right which I defend , although I make no secret of the fact that I am voting against Turkey &apos;s accession .
it has become perfectly clear that these are not points of order , but rather explanations of the attitudes of each Member towards the issue we are dealing with and I therefore see no need or reason to continue giving the floor for points of order .
nevertheless , we must organise our work and we must , of course , do so in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , which sometimes lend themselves to interpretations that must be clarified , as in this case .
the Presidency has received three requests for secret ballots presented in accordance with Rule 162 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure , which says , and I quote - I will do so in Spanish and naturally it will have to be translated : &apos; voting may also be by secret ballot if requested by at least one @-@ fifth of the component Members of Parliament .
such requests must be made before voting begins . &quot;
with regard to the application of this provision , in this case , having heard those Members who have spoken under the guise of points of order and naturally having sought the opinion and the advice of the legal services of the House and the General Secretariat , which I am obliged to do , I can tell you the following : firstly , that the competent services have confirmed to me that these requests have been endorsed by a sufficient number of Members and that they have in fact been presented on time .
secondly , we have the issue , that some of you have raised , of the interpretation of whether or not we are obliged to hold a secret ballot , since Rule 162 ( 2 ) , which has been mentioned so often this morning , says that &apos; voting may also be by secret ballot &quot; rather than &apos; voting will also be . &quot;
there is , therefore , room for interpretation of what the Rules of Procedure say .
furthermore , the Court of First Instance of the European Communities issued a judgment in October 2001 in which it also interpreted the term &apos; may &quot; or &apos; can &quot; as an obligatory condition in relation to a Rule of Procedure similar to the one we are dealing with now .
in accordance with these precedents and regardless - I would insist - of the opinions of any particular person on whether matters should be done one way or another , the Presidency believes that , since a request has been presented on time and correctly , we must proceed to a secret ballot ...
... although this issue , for future occasions , must be considered by Parliament &apos;s committee responsible for issues relating to Rules of Procedure .
we shall probably have to clarify in the future whether or not the Presidency &apos;s interpretation is correct , but at this point in the procedure , the Presidency must take responsibility for the decision without having the opportunity to take the advice of the competent committees , and it is my feeling , having heard all the Members and the legal services , that according to a correct interpretation of the Rules of Procedure we must proceed to the secret ballot requested , and that is what we are going to do .
with regard to how the vote will be taken , I must inform the honourable Members that I have decided that we shall use the electronic procedure in accordance with Rule 161 ( 1 ) and there is , therefore , no reason to designate a college of tellers .
it shall be secret , but electronic .
having said that , we shall begin the votes .
Mr President , I should like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 71 , as it mentions certain facts with which not everyone is familiar .
on behalf of my group , I should like to suggest replacing the phrase &apos; the re @-@ opening to pilgrims of the Armenian National Mausoleum in northern Anatolia &quot; - in which the word &apos; mausoleum &quot; is an inaccurate translation - with the phrase &apos; the re @-@ opening to pilgrims of the ruined Armenian churches of Ani , near Kars in Eastern Anatolia . &quot;
none of our Armenian friends were aware of this place or of its opening to pilgrims .
the same can be said for the second oral amendment I would like to propose .
there is doubt as to whether Turkish historians are in fact keen to carry out research into the genocide , and I therefore propose removing the reference to &apos; Turkish historians &quot; in the plural , and merely including the name of the head of their school , or &apos; Halil Berktay , &quot; the Turkish historian who has done a great deal to further our knowledge of the Armenian genocide .
ladies and gentlemen , many of you have said that you were unfamiliar with this name , and that the amendment was out of place , but you should now be aware that it is a reference to Halil Berktay .
the rest is to remain unchanged , as these were merely clarifications .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , vehicle theft is on the rise in Europe , as is a feeling of insecurity among our citizens .
Europol tells us that of the 1 million @-@ plus cars stolen in 2002 , fewer than 39 % were recovered .
in Parliament we have adopted and recommended various measures .
we did this as recently as March and I congratulate the Council for finally implementing some of them .
better late than never . the proposal submitted to us by the Netherlands is well intentioned but in the wrong form .
the text submitted to us should have fallen under the scope of the first pillar and not the third .
the Commission upheld our arguments in this regard .
some people in this House felt that it should be rejected for this reason .
we saw it differently in the Civil Liberties Committee .
we have removed from the text anything that should exclusively fall under the Community pillar and included anything that could be covered by the intergovernmental pillar .
Mr President , we have proved that Parliament has acted in good faith and is sensitive to the growing problem of car theft and the criminality that goes with it .
we should like to give one message to the Council : it would be good if , in the future , the Council and the Member States showed greater respect for Parliament &apos;s prerogatives .
one last word to thank all those Members of this House who contributed with proposals and advice , in particular the Members of the Transport Committee and Mr Jardim Fernandes and Mrs Wortmann @-@ Kool .
Mr President , our oral Amendment No 28 is intended to provide better and more effective protection for the rights we intend to protect and to do so in a realistic manner , not through utopian proposals .
for the sake of realism , based on experience , what we are asking , Mr President , is that the expression &apos; in the applicant &apos;s own language &quot; be replaced with the expression &apos; a language comprehensible to the applicant . &quot;
Mr President , in order not to be tiresome , I will simply say that my arguments are the same as those I put forward in defence of oral Amendment No 28 .
- Mr President , it is with great pleasure that I give an explanation of my vote on the report on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
I shall start by saying that I voted against Turkey joining the European Union , but I should like to explain how I arrived at that decision .
last week , on 9 December , I found myself in Reggio Calabria , where I had been invited by the Pensioners &quot; Party official Carlo Rositani to give a lecture at the Tommaso Gulli Teacher Training College .
I asked a class of about 120 girls aged between 16 and 19 to vote for or against Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
the ballot of these 120 youngsters gave the following result : 100 girls out of 120 voted against accession while the other 20 abstained .
I have therefore willingly gone along with those young people &apos;s vote .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey .
this is a matter of principle for me .
the European Union , founded in Rome in 1957 , has always defined itself in Christian and democratic terms , based on Greek philosophy , Roman law and Christian faith .
as a result of today &apos;s profoundly misguided decision by the European Parliament , we are abandoning this spirit of Rome .
the former French President , Giscard d &apos;Estaing , is quite right : it would indeed be the end of the EU as we know it .
may God protect the West &apos;s Christian civilisation .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report on Turkey and I believe we did good work today .
we have given encouragement to those inside Turkey and indeed to those outside Turkey who have campaigned and worked hard for a secular Turkish state , a Turkish state based on democracy and a Turkish state that respects human rights .
we have also sent a strong message to the 15 million Muslims who already live inside the European Union that this is not an exclusive Christian club .
so all in all I am very pleased with the work we have carried out this morning .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to remind all Members of this House , both those who voted for and those who voted against , that the vote was not on whether Turkey should be accepted into the European Union or not .
this may well be a good thing .
what Parliament has done is to vote in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey .
whether Turkey joins the European Union or not will depend on the course of these negotiations and on their outcome .
it is my impression that there are still Members of the House who are not aware of this .
- Mr President , I am opposed to Parliament &apos;s decision to begin negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession , because Turkey is not Europe !
in addition , we are running the risk of one day seeing a flag flying over these institutions - the Turkish flag - which is still stained with the blood of the Armenian people , whose holocaust is not recognised by Turkey .
we have betrayed the spirit of Lepanto , a thousand @-@ year tradition of a Europe that is and wants to remain attached to its Christian roots .
Turkish society , moreover , is still closely tied to the principles of Islamic fundamentalism , and that is a grave danger of which Europe should be more aware .
we are therefore proud to have voted against starting the procedures for Turkey to join Europe , and we consider that those European politicians who irresponsibly supported that decision should be ashamed of themselves , because the decision goes against the wishes of the majority of the people .
we call for a referendum to be held in all the countries of the European Union so that the people can have their say , because the peoples of Europe are against Turkey &apos;s accession .
Mr President , in of 8 December , Mr Erdogan , the Turkish Prime Minister , stated that if the EU is not a Christian club , then it should be possible for an Islamic country such as Turkey to join .
what this means is that Europe should abandon its individuality , or a large proportion of it anyway , while Turkey is allowed to stay an Islamic club .
a few days later , Mr Erdogan , in alerted the European leaders to the fact that violence from Islamic extremists could escalate if Europe rejects Turkey as a candidate country .
since Mr Erdogan is himself from that background , we can consider this as a downright threat , as blackmail , pure and simple .
we in the European Parliament no longer even have the self @-@ respect to act against that kind of blackmail .
moreover , how will we in future reject applications from Morocco , for example , if we include a non @-@ European country such as Turkey ?
the public is being taken for a ride ; we are told that Turkey is being assessed according to the Copenhagen criteria , but that does not appear to be the case .
it is not a problem that in Turkey , torture is being carried out on a massive scale , that Turkey has its troops occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State and even refuses to recognise that state .
I can only conclude that we in this House have become too pusillanimous to carry on protecting our own interests as Europeans .
Mr President , let me focus on the positive aspects first .
we have intensified our confrontation course on human rights issues - which is directed against the Turkish Government , not the Turkish people - by calling for rights and freedoms for the Kurds and for the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians to be acknowledged and properly examined .
another positive point is that we have not demanded Turkey &apos;s accession , but merely the opening of accession negotiations , which I voted against .
given that the Members who are in favour of accession negotiations include many who are ultimately opposed to accession , we appear to be on the right track .
we were in the minority at first , but our course is now endorsed by the largest group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and we just need another 40 Members to adopt a clear position over the coming years .
there will then be no majority in this House in favour of Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union when we finally take a binding vote on this issue .
that apart , it is a matter for the PPE @-@ DE Heads of Government , at the Brussels summit in two days &apos; time , to stop the onward surge of the lemmings , which inevitably ends in disaster .
.
our Europe is an open Europe , founded on the European public culture derived from our common values and standards .
this &apos; unity in diversity &quot; is both Europe &apos;s most important characteristic and its greatest asset .
the implication of such a political project is that there are limits .
the Union &apos;s further enlargement should not stand in the way of its becoming even deeper .
after all , Turkish membership threatens to turn the Union into a merely economic cooperative which will no longer be able to carry out important supranational responsibilities in a coordinated manner .
a Union devoid of any strength and spirit , paralysed by internal contradictions ; that is not the outcome for which many had worked and about which they had dreamed .
there is no doubt that Turkey has made an important journey over the past few years .
these reforms and in @-@ depth economic cooperation must definitely be continued .
in this respect , a special partnership between the Union and Turkey seems to be the appropriate route , in which , alongside far @-@ reaching economic cooperation , conditions can also be agreed in the areas of the Kurds , women &apos;s rights and human rights in general .
since this latter element is not provided for in the report , I shall be voting against the report and the resolution .
.
although the Commission &apos;s report was well @-@ founded , its recommendations of 6 October no longer required Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915 .
this genocide resulted in the death of over one million people , which was equivalent to nearly two thirds of the country &apos;s largest minority .
this crime , which was carried out with intent and which led to widespread and systematic destruction , was the first genocide of the twentieth century , and yet even today the Turkish State continues to oppose references to it .
the worst possible course of action now would be to remain silent .
the Commission &apos;s silence could lead one to think that this tragedy does not concern it in any way , and that it is a problem for Turks and Armenians alone .
this is something I find disturbing , not for reasons of religion , history or community , but because this is a political issue which has direct bearing on democracy and human rights .
this is an issue which goes back to the very foundations of the European Union , laid after the Second World War when France and Germany affirmed their desire to bring peace to Europe .
this meant that our continent &apos;s most tragic hours were overcome , even though the full extent of the extermination of Jews would not be fully acknowledged until later .
this is why the Armenian issue is crucial for a Europe seeking to become an area of freedom and anti @-@ totalitarianism where a modern and secular citizenship flourishes .
.
I abstained from voting on the European Commission &apos;s 2004 regular report and recommendations on Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession for the following reasons .
I believe that the European Union &apos;s inability to formulate , approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the welcoming of Turkey into the Community .
it appears to me to be questionable , if not irresponsible , to pursue a policy of never @-@ ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality .
at present , the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the size of Turkey .
I would note that our position is not based on arguments relating to geographical , historical , religious or cultural aspects .
it is not Turkey &apos;s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view , but the European Union &apos;s inability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future .
. - On behalf of the CSU Members of the European Parliament , I would like to clarify our position in relation to the possible opening of accession negotiations with Turkey once more .
today &apos;s vote has shown that the &apos; privileged partnership &apos; model is endorsed by many of our fellow Members from all EU Member States and all political groups .
this refutes the arguments , in particular , of those who claim that the CDU and the CSU are isolated on this issue in Europe .
I hope that the European Council will also take this into account at its deliberations on Friday .
we continue to take the view that the European Union &apos;s record of success would be massively jeopardised by Turkish accession .
anyone wanting Europe to degenerate into a free @-@ trade area will achieve their objective through Turkey &apos;s accession .
if , on the other hand , we want a strong Europe with the capacity to act , the special relationship established by a privileged partnership is the appropriate means by which to fulfil this aim .
the European Council , at its meeting on Friday , must be mindful of this responsibility .

.
I will be voting in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey for membership of the European Union .
Turkey does not as yet meet the criteria for membership .
its record on human rights with respect to its Kurdish and Assyrian minorities is deeply flawed .
its record with respect to trade union rights is poor .
it has failed properly to come to terms with the Armenian genocide .
yet none of these should be seen as barriers to starting a process that will enable the Commission and Parliament to press for their correction .
a &apos; yes &apos; vote today will support the campaigns of all progressive forces in Turkey to shed the last remnants of Turkey &apos;s authoritarian past .
if together we can achieve these changes I will support Turkey joining the Union , as my Europe is based on shared values that are not limited to one particular set of religious values and beliefs .
if we do not achieve this , I will vote &apos; no &apos; , even if the economic conditions have been met .
.
I voted in favour of opening the process of Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU .
this does not entail making a final decision on this process , which will take years to negotiate .
furthermore , I voted against partnership status , because that would mean that the EU has not honoured its promises .
I voted in favour , particularly in light of the testimonies of numerous Turkish human rights defenders , who have confirmed that there have been positive developments in Turkey .
those developments are not sufficient , of course ; there are still political prisoners , there is still torture in prisons and there remains much to do .
stopping the process of opening negotiations at this time would have terrible consequences for the human rights situation in Turkey .
I voted in favour , although we have not had the opportunity for serious contemplation as to where Europe should extend , and because I do not accept the political and cultural borders of the &apos; Christian Club Europe , &quot; nor the prophecies of the &apos; clash of civilisations . &quot;
I voted in favour , provided that Turkey recognises , without delay , the EU Member State of Cyprus , and withdraws , without delay , from the part of Cyprus that it occupies militarily .
I voted in favour of acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian people by Turkey , as I believe that this is essential for reconciliation with its neighbours and with its history .
the June List does not view Turkey &apos;s geographical position or its Muslim religion as obstacles to its membership of the EU .
we welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU .
we must not , however , close our eyes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible .
Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide .
it must give its minorities full human rights .
it must achieve a level of economic development such that its membership does not release tensions that may threaten the internal market .
the EU must also change .
the common agricultural policy must be abolished , and structural policy must be revised before Turkey , large and poor as it is , can be absorbed .
to ensure grass @-@ roots support , membership negotiations should , moreover , only be embarked upon once the issue has been debated in the Member States &quot; election campaigns up until 2008 .
finally , the issue of the EU &apos;s Constitution must be solved before the EU adopts a position on the issue of negotiations concerning Turkish membership .
.
I voted against this report .
our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlargements , and above all about the continuing lack of responses to the crucial question of where Europe &apos;s borders lie .
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it has occupied for 30 years , and it punishes anyone who refers to the Armenian genocide .
ninety @-@ seven per cent of Turkey &apos;s territory is outside Europe , and Turkey therefore has no right to join the European Union .
Turkey &apos;s integration into the EU would be tantamount to rejecting a political Europe straightaway , before it has even come into being , and to perpetuating the image of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure .
would this be a sensible course of action ?
those in favour of Turkey &apos;s accession hide behind the Copenhagen criteria under the pretext that Turkey could one day adhere to them , yet this is a trick .
it is not enough to insist only on adherence to these criteria as an indispensable condition to be met before any new accession , because this would mean that any country in the world which adhered to them could , in its turn , join the European Union .
this is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France .
.
today this House has finally reached a decision on Turkey &apos;s membership of the European Union .
this was a vote eagerly awaited by European citizens , who struggle to understand their governments &quot; attitudes on this issue .
I voted against the draft report by Mr Eurlings , as it came to the conclusion that &apos; the European Council &#91; should &#93; open the negotiations with Turkey without undue delay , &quot; and that &apos; the objective of the negotiations is Turkish EU membership . &quot;
the European project is a well @-@ defined one , the aim of which is to share a number of competences between neighbouring and similar countries in order to build a new political whole .
integrating Turkey into this whole would be problematic for a number of reasons .
firstly , Turkey is not part of the European continent in geographical terms , as over 90 % of its territory is in Asia , and 90 % of its borders are with Asian countries .
secondly , throughout history Turkey has shared none of our values , with such values ensuring that Europe today is based on a foundation of common traditions kept alive by all of us .
finally , I should like to advance a weighty argument which directly affects our institutional structure ; if Turkey enters the European Union it will have the largest population of any Member State , which will mean ...
.
the European Parliamentary Labour Party strongly welcomes the clear recommendation in this resolution , that EU leaders should announce the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey without delay .
we recognise the sensitivities with regard to issues surrounding Turkey &apos;s relations with Armenia , however these will be dealt with during the negotiations process .
the report does not in any way imply that resolution of these issues is a precondition to opening talks .
we also register our opposition to any permanent safeguards affecting free movement of workers .
Turkey should receive equal , fair and proper treatment during the negotiations .
- As Chairman of the European Parliament &apos;s Delegation on the countries of the South Caucasus , I welcome the adoption by a large majority of the Eurlings report on opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and would reiterate how crucial it is for the peoples of Europe and for the stability of an entire continent to open the doors of the European Union to this country .
I regret the fact that the European Union did not make the issue of lifting the blockade and opening the border with Turkey &apos;s neighbour , Armenia , part of the discussions on Turkey &apos;s possible accession from the outset , and I regret that Turkey has not taken this historic opportunity to show goodwill by opening its border with Armenia .
yet using the border issue and the Armenian genocide as reasons to refuse to open up to Turkey , as right @-@ wing French political parties in particular have done , is unacceptable .
they are wrong to brandish this argument so soon before the Council makes its decision on opening negotiations , and their only purpose in so doing is to hide their real reasons for rejecting Turkey &apos;s integration .
- More and more European nations , following the example of the French , Germans , Greeks and Austrians , are showing their opposition to Turkey , an Asian country which is part of the Muslim world , entering Europe .
the leaders of the Europe of Brussels , in particular Mr Chirac , are well aware of this .
that is why they are maintaining that opening the accession negotiations would not automatically lead to Turkey &apos;s accession .
this assertion , repeated in Mr Eurlings &quot; report , is an untruth : since the first enlargement of 1972 , every negotiation process has been followed by the accession of the candidate country .
it will be the same for Turkey , especially as its Islamist leaders have warned us that they will not make any concessions .
if on 17 December , against the will of the people , the European Council decides to open accession negotiations with the Turkish Government , the referendum on the European Constitution will be France &apos;s last opportunity to avoid being swallowed up in a union that is European in name alone , and in which Turkey , the most populous country , will play a prominent part .
- I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deeper political integration and created a powerful Europe and a social Europe .
with each enlargement the prospect of a federal Europe fades .
Turkey &apos;s entry will further dilute the European project , and it is not desirable for it to be integrated into the EU in its present form .
the issue that will arise for everyone has nothing to do with either religion or geography : the European Union has to be a political project .
this project is now under threat because it is being limited to a free @-@ trade area with less and less regulation .
we need to overhaul the architecture of Europe and have a federal core , then a Union of 27 countries and then a zone of enhanced cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Turkey , and also other countries like the Maghreb countries , with which we enjoy close links .
approving the opening of negotiations makes this a more distant prospect and continues a policy of ongoing enlargement .
legitimate requirements are made of Turkey , but it goes without saying that if this country meets them it will be impossible to refuse it entry .
before any possible accession negotiations we need to define the future shape of Europe .
we should reject enlargement and begin a different kind of cooperation with Turkey .
.
as a Member of this House , I have belonged to the parliamentary friendship group with Turkey for as long as it has existed .
no one , therefore , can accuse me of not being well @-@ disposed towards Turkey .
as things stand , however , I feel I am justified in asking whether all the conditions - especially as regards human rights - have genuinely been fulfilled .
I gladly acknowledge that on the issue of women &apos;s rights , for example , more reforms have been introduced since Turkey was granted the prospect of accession than in the decades before .
nonetheless , they have largely taken place on paper ; the reality still lags behind .
I was recently confronted with information alleging that sterilisations of Kurdish women have been carried out in Turkey .
when we signed an Association Agreement with Turkey in 1963 , which offered the prospect of membership , the European Union did not exist ; at that time , we were still the European Economic Community .
since a customs union with Turkey has existed since 1996 , what we have now is very similar to an economic community in which any remaining trade barriers can be dismantled swiftly .
from this perspective too , and because there is no question that Turkey must remain fully anchored in European structures , the option of a tailor @-@ made special status instead of the discriminatory membership deal proposed by the Commission would appear to be a more accessible and honourable path for Turkey , aside from the fact that there are justified doubts ...
. - I voted in favour of the report by Mr Εurlings on Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession to the European Union , because it is the product of compromise between the various political groups in the European Parliament .
however , I am in no way bound by the phrase in paragraph 38 concerning use of the Annan plan as a basis for efforts to settle the Cyprus question , in that this plan was rejected by 76 % of Greek Cypriots and 67 % of all Cypriots .
as Article 38 rightly says , a solution can be found on the basis of the principles upon which the EU is founded .
I also have reservations about the exact content of paragraph 39 , which I consider to be incompatible with the report by Mrs Mechtild Rothe , which the European Parliament voted in favour of about a month ago ( see : Rothe report , Amendment No 2 , Recital 4a ( new ) ( 4a ) page 6 / 15 ) .
.
since the Atatürk revolution in 1923 , Turkey has been a typically European country , albeit of the old @-@ fashioned , authoritarian kind , which we no longer want in Europe these days .
the army &apos;s power is immense ; there are political prisoners ; parties and newspapers are often banned and an electoral threshold of 10 % keeps even most legal parties outside of parliament .
Kurds , Armenians and Assyrians are given the choice between leaving the country or adapting to the language , the culture and religion of the Turkish majority .
Turkey must change a great deal before we can welcome it , not only in its legislation but also in daily life .
after more than 40 years , it is now proposed to open negotiations shortly with a view to full membership of the EU .
that is also what the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin want .
a decision as to whether Turkey may join will be made not before , but during , the negotiations .
there is the risk that the Turkish Government may consider that after three or five years &quot; negotiations , Turkey deserves EU membership , without the problems of democracy , human rights and ethnic minorities having been resolved by then , with the potential for conflicts and an eventual rift .
the Copenhagen criteria must not be replaced by Ankara criteria .
.
I have voted for Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession despite having serious reservations .
I would like to emphasise that my reason for voting Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession is because it is a Muslim country and will serve as an important bridge between Europe and the Middle East in particular .
I have concerns , however , that Turkey still has a very large number of human rights abuses .
I also have concerns that a country with such a massive number of people living in poverty will not be able to reach the levels acquired in the , and I fear that the emphasis has been on the market access to Turkey rather than the need for Turkey to conform to the social and environmental standards in the EU .
I am not interested in seeing the enlargement of Europe simply in order to see a larger market .
an equal emphasis must be placed on social and environmental considerations .
. - The delegation has voted for the Eurlings report on the opening of the accession procedure for Turkey , a procedure that will take several years .
the opening of the procedure unequivocally heralds a change in the political course steered by the Turkish Government , not only in respect of the Community and the Copenhagen conditions but especially concerning the resolution of the Armenian and the Kurdish questions .
the believes that the Council decision of 17 December should make it unequivocally clear that the opening of negotiations with Turkey requires the Turkish Government &apos;s recognition of the State of Cyprus , a full Member State of the European Union , and consequently the resolution of the Cypriot question , which means the withdrawal of the 35.000 Turkish troops which , in occupying Cyprus , are occupying a territory of the European Union .
the will watch to ensure that the guarantees and conditions included in the report are complied with , because a successful conclusion to Turkey &apos;s journey towards accession will not be possible unless they are complied with .
. - Turkey &apos;s possible accession to the European Union brings with it many benefits and a few risks .
the benefits are more political than economic since , as well as being a member of NATO , Turkey has signed a customs union treaty with the European Union that already permits free trade .
its accession would not only fulfil the dream of millions of citizens of fully belonging to the secular western world , but it would shift the centre of gravity of political and economic influence towards the Mediterranean basin , confirming Europe as a world power no longer closed in within its geopolitical boundaries .
on the other hand , the risks that should be taken into consideration are , first , the reduced likelihood of seeing the birth of a Europe with its own common foreign policy , as well as the possible difficulty of making two diverse religious and cultural identities coexist .
can it describe itself yet as a democratic state that respects its ethnic minorities ?
secondly , it would have a negative effect on the allocation of European funds to regions currently considered to be &apos; lagging behind in their development , &quot; such as Sicily , at least in the short term .
lastly , Turkey should withdraw from that part of Cyprus under military occupation , and it goes without saying that it must declare its willingness to square its account with history by acknowledging the errors it has made over the last hundred years ...
- I abstained from the final vote on the Eurlings report .
it would , firstly , be reasonable not to consider any further enlargement before first deciding where Europe &apos;s borders lie .
pushing back their limits indefinitely risks turning Europe into nothing more than a vast free @-@ trade area .
such a renouncement is anathema to convinced federalists .
secondly , experience shows that once negotiations have been opened , accession inevitably follows once the candidate country meets the conditions laid down , and in particular the Copenhagen criteria .
but although we might legitimately hope that Turkey will continue to build on the progress it has made , particularly on democracy and human rights , there is as yet no guarantee that Europe is prepared to provide the resources , not least the budgetary resources , to go ahead with such an enlargement in a mutually satisfactory way .
my abstention is then a warning to the European Summit of 17 December : no more enlargement without deeper integration !
we have to stop presenting the peoples of Europe with and instructing them to ratify decisions taken in their absence several years earlier by the Heads of State or Government .
.
this report updates Turkey &apos;s development as regards its eventual accession to the EU , in common with the report by Mr Oostlander adopted on 1 April .
as I had the opportunity to write then , I feel that Turkey was perhaps hastily recognised by the Council as a candidate for accession .
in the same way , I believe that the Commission recently repeated the mistake when it deemed that the Copenhagen criteria have already been satisfied , while there are still situations such as those detailed in the motion for a resolution that are blatantly at variance with this position .
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;s position that this must be an open @-@ ended process , without a predetermined outcome , albeit a process that does point towards accession .
I also share his desire to see that , regardless of the outcome , Turkey presses ahead with and firmly establishes the welcome reforms that it has been carrying out .
in so doing it will confirm its credentials as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that respects human rights .
- I supported opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and I did so for one reason above all : I want a better world for tomorrow , characterised by stability and security .
no one can see into the future , but I know one thing : sharing this area of peace and democracy on which our Union is founded is a unique opportunity that we cannot allow to slip away .
yes , we should stand firm in the name of historical truth , which is why I continue , as I have done in the past , to demand that the Turkish authorities acknowledge their part in the Armenian genocide .
one truth and one history : we owe it to that same history also to remember that for 50 years Turkey has played an essential role as a loyal ally at the gates of Europe .
standing firm means sending out a strong message : the marriage will only take place if further considerable progress is made on respect for minorities and gender equality .
I am pleased that the European Parliament supported my amendment to Paragraph 26 on zero tolerance with regard to crimes of honour .
in conclusion , I would ask that the people have a say in the final decision : referendum or consultations ...
. many advantages could be gained from Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union , above all an extension of the common market and a strengthening of transatlantic links .
yet both these goals can be achieved without Turkey joining the European Union .
the European Economic Area is an excellent example of a platform for good economic cooperation with the EU .
it could also be useful to propose a reform of security policy to Turkey , as the country is one of Europe &apos;s major strategic partners in the field of security .
a privileged partnership of this kind with Turkey would provide us with the chance of avoiding a crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy .
if we wish to avoid migration @-@ related conflicts , we should not be instrumental in a Muslim country becoming the European Union &apos;s largest Member State in the near future .
it is estimated that Turkey will have a population of around 90 million in 2020 .
the development of closer relations with Turkey should also be kept more in proportion to Europe &apos;s policy of openness towards Ukraine .
these are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of the Eurlings report .
we consider it to be imprudent , as despite serious grounds for opposition to Turkey &apos;s membership in the EU it continues to support such a membership .
the ongoing discussion of Turkey &apos;s chances of joining the European Union will fuel increased resentment in Turkey .
.
I supported the Eurlings report and should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
I will say this in public since we were unable to demonstrate our position in another way on account of the unfortunate secret ballot .
my vote in favour of opening negotiations certainly does not mean that I cannot wait for them to start .
my group rightly believes that it is actually too soon , and I share that view .
at the same time , though , we would like to remain realistic , because after all , the train was put in motion in 1999 and in 2002 .
moreover , we expect that the European Council will give the negotiations the green light .
what matters to us in the ballot is that the Union should retain its credibility and that we send a clear message about the conditions under which these open @-@ ended negotiations are to proceed .
the conditions in the report are strict , but fair .
we support them wholeheartedly , and that is why I have voted in favour .
.
I voted in favour of the report before us because I feel that the initiatives concerned , which are intended to adopt a Council decision on vehicle crime with cross @-@ border implications , addresses the concerns that we ought to have as regards combating crime .
furthermore , despite the fact that conferring direct access to SIS may appear to run counter to the rule that &apos; data may not be used for administrative purposes , &quot; the truth is that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that this cannot happen in this case .
.
vehicle theft makes up a significant proportion of crime and has cross @-@ border implications for the EU , and as such is an issue requiring urgent action .
one must also take into account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often than not only one element of broader criminal activity , encompassing various types of crime spread across an enormous geographical area .
it is therefore crucial that the movement and registration process for vehicles from other Member States and , indeed , third countries is monitored extremely carefully .
the rapporteur was right to observe that the new feature of the Dutch proposal is that of national contact points .
I feel that it will be useful to monitor the effectiveness of their activities and periodically to review the methods and practices adopted .
the Commission &apos;s White Paper on the subject , as proposed by the rapporteur , will accord this issue a broader scope .
.
it should be pointed out , however , that there is a long way to go on this issue , especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that respects the existing cultural diversity , whereby policies are put in place that promote small and medium @-@ sized farming , in contrast with the current measures in place , which , if they achieve their aims , will sacrifice and penalise farmers with fewer resources .
the creation of MRLs on pesticides in food for ...
.
I welcome this report and the objectives contained within it .
however , we must remember that having established regulations for maximum residue levels of pesticides in food and feed of plant and animal origin , the main priority must be that it is properly implemented and regulated .
consumers deserve to be protected and thorough implementation can safe @-@ guard their rights .
.
I wholeheartedly welcome this report , because I consider that recasting and streamlining Community legislation in this area fosters trade within the internal market and with third countries , and does no harm from a Portuguese perspective .
.
the proposal before us seeks to recast Community legislation on pesticides by replacing the four directives in force with one single regulation .
the proposal also seeks to safeguard certain key objectives , such as establishing a homogenous level of consumer protection throughout the Community , by defining the role of the European Food Safety Authority , and by increasing the trade in foodstuffs within the EU .
I believe that significant progress has been made between the first and second readings , namely the Council &apos;s adoption of both the amendments tabled by Parliament and the introduction of amendments to its initiative , which have certainly improved the Commission &apos;s original proposal .
I feel , however , that there remain aspects that could be clarified , such as the distinction between residues - in the context of maximum residue limits ( MRLs ) - and pesticides .
I agree with the rapporteur , however , that when MRLs are exceeded , those responsible must be held to account and subgroups that may consume more of a certain type of product must be fully protected .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that we have made our position clear to Russia .
like Turkey , Russia is a country which is only partly European and will never join the EU , but it is an extremely important partner .
however , precisely because it is an important partner , we must steadfastly oppose the systematic dismantling of democracy and the rule of law in Russia and the continuing genocide against the Chechen people in a colonial war .
I therefore wish to send a clear message to President Putin from this House : we regard Russia as an important partner , but the statement which he has made against Ukraine , its liberation movement and the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe is an attack on free Europe .
we are hoping for cooperation here , not for a continuation of this unacceptable confrontation course .
.
I voted in favour of this motion for a joint resolution because I feel that the question before us - relations between the EU and Russia , which is an important international player and the most important neighbour of many of the countries covered by our neighbourhood policy - is crucially important for the future of the area that we share throughout the European continent , and as regards certain concerns at world level .
nevertheless , I must point out that , in spite of the reservations that I have expressed , I welcome the concern at Russia &apos;s interference in countries that were previously part of its sphere of influence .
.
the strategic relevance of relations between the EU and the Russian Federation is undeniable , and the ongoing initiatives to promote and institutionalise those relations are to be welcomed .
indeed , common borders and interests combine to create an enlarged area of understanding , given the mutual interest in maintaining permanent dialogue on the fields proposed for the four common spaces , the common economic space ; the common space of freedom , security and justice ; the common space of cooperation in the field of external security ; the common space of research , education and culture .
that is not to overlook the worrying signs in the area of human rights and civil liberties that have come to light in Russia , as regards political processes and procedures and the question of Chechnya .
the same can also be said of Moscow &apos;s disastrous interventions , recently in Ukraine and previously in Georgia and Belarus , which have done nothing to benefit the political processes of those countries .
I note and appreciate the desire shown by Russia to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Second World War , but I completely reject the manner in which the victory for democracy and freedom is compared with the criminal totalitarian subjugation to which all peoples to the east of the iron curtain were subjected .
.
the two Commission communications on the common asylum policy are most welcome .
they are intended to raise the standard of application of the current directives in the EU , providing for the possibility of a review and to improve conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing .
I welcome these Commission proposals intended to improve the assessment process by adopting a single procedure , thereby simplifying the process for both the applicant and the administration .
improvements are to be introduced to training , in @-@ country assessment and the related information and judicial procedures .
I also welcome the additional measures proposed , which offer the means for managed , legal entry into the EU , not least if they help to reduce trafficking in human beings , along with the intention to develop high @-@ quality protection regimes in receiving countries .
I cannot agree , however , with some of the proposals put forward by Mrs Lambert in her report and shall , therefore , be voting against . one of the main reasons why I reject the report is that it plans to extend the scope of the Directive on minimum standards for procedures
. I supported , spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambert &apos;s report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin ( 2004 / 2121 ( INI ) ) on Asylum .
the overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy .
however I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states &apos; Considers that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention ... &quot;
Sinn Féin believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention .
however we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty .
the most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations .
the EU should play a more pro @-@ active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context .
.
whilst we do not accept , and are in fact critical of , certain aspects of this EP initiative report , such as its supranational outlook and its support for the common foreign and security policy , we also appreciate its positive aspects .
we feel that , as part of the current policies pursued at EU level , this resolution criticises very mildly , and does not condemn clearly , the impact of the current EU asylum policy .
it does , however , among other points , highlight this threat to &apos; the European humanitarian tradition &quot; and criticises what is termed the &apos; outsourcing &quot; of the process of application by sending applicants for refugee status to a third country , and condemns the lengthy processing of asylum claims .
the resolution contains a number of points that we welcome , such as its call for strict compliance with international standards , encompassing the principle that refugees may not be expelled ( allowing the asylum seeker to enter the country in which the request was made ) ; the rejection of any funding for detention camps or any other centre restricting asylum seekers &quot; personal freedom ; and an end to the policy of repatriation and readmission aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin , as our group had proposed .
hence our vote in favour .
the report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin is part of establishing the first stage of a common European asylum system , and the aim is to apply one and the same procedure to international protection in all the Member States .
the June List does not , however , wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe . an EU Member State must be able to conduct a generous refugee policy if it wishes to do so .
we cannot therefore support the report .
- This report is a further step towards the adoption of a single asylum procedure .
curiously , it does not apply solely to political refugees , who should nevertheless be the only ones entitled to apply for asylum under the Geneva Convention .
it also applies to all of those who might benefit from &apos; subsidiary protection , &quot; that is those who cannot return home because of the general situation in their country of origin .
the future European asylum application procedure will therefore cover all those who wish to migrate .
it is true that in the borderless Europe of Brussels there is a political tradition of systematically fostering immigration .
moreover , Paragraph 25 of the report states that we need , &apos; a common asylum procedure within the EU based upon high standards of delivery . &quot;
this report on the rights of migrants makes no mention of illegal immigrants , however .
furthermore , the return policy is strictly defined : the refusal to grant asylum has to be duly reasoned in writing in an &apos; authenticated document &quot; in the applicant &apos;s own language , and it is not possible to use charter flights .
in addition , the report rules out the possibility of setting up detention centres in transit countries .
.
I wish to congratulate Mrs Lambert on her important and timely report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin .
I endorse the report , in particular where it proposes , in addition to the current European common asylum policy , the creation of measures both to develop orderly and better organised entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection and to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin .
the aim is therefore to protect , at an early stage , political asylum seekers and refugees who , given the lengthy processing of asylum claims , especially in crisis situations , may resort to illegal means of travel , which may undermine their personal security .
statistics show that in 2003 some 70 % of the world &apos;s refugees remained in their region of origin .
it is therefore essential to offer greater protection of better quality in those regions , but to be clear that this is in addition to the EU &apos;s current responsibilities to offer protection under international agreements .
.
I welcome this report as it stresses the need for a high quality asylum procedure that acts acquiescent and compatible with the Geneva Conventions in addition to other existing international legal instruments .
I am in agreement with this report whereby the speed and administrative efficiency are important in assessing any system but they cannot be the only criteria when people &apos;s futures are at risk .
I commend the report for recognizing that although the intention to develop high quality protection regimes in conjunction with receiving countries is to be welcomed but should not become a means to enhance border control with the intent of preventing people moving on or a way of abdicating our own protection responsibilities .
.
I supported , spoke in favour and voted in favour of Jean Denise Lambert &apos;s report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin ( 2004 / 2121 ( INI ) ) on Asylum .
the overwhelming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy .
however I have strong reservations about point 19 when it states &apos; Considers that a decisive common foreign and security policy committing the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention ......... &apos;
Sinn Féin believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negotiation as an alternative to military intervention .
however we are wary of the moves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermine national sovereignty .
the most appropriate vehicle for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the auspices of the United Nations .
the EU should play a more pro @-@ active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context .
.
my opinion of this report is based on the following main factors :
on the one hand , I am in favour of some of the essential issues raised , in particular where the report proposes to establish universal standards for applying existing directives , and advocates improving conditions for the vast majority of refugees in the countries of origin .
on the other hand , I disagree on a key point : the application of asylum procedures to other situations of subsidiary protection .
in the end , I voted against the report in light of the vote on certain amendments that I considered fundamental .
.
the approach to issues relating to the granting of asylum has swung between two extreme perspectives , neither of which has , in practice , proved an effective means of resolving the problem .
the truth is that neither the concept of Fortress Europe nor that of Sanctuary Europe has much to do with reality .
they are both caricatures , distortions of a complex issue that is intrinsically linked to people &apos;s rights and expectations and to the need to safeguard collective security and public order .
at a time when the area of freedom , security and justice is being consolidated , I feel that it is appropriate to address this issue and the role of countries of origin and of transit in the problem before us .
whilst I understand the generosity underpinning the rapporteur &apos;s proposal , I cannot vote in favour of it , because , as regards granting refugee status , the proposal does not only deal with the cases of individuals - it widens the scope to subsidiary protection , and this raises doubts as to the appropriateness and proportionality of the proposal .
. - The ΕU wants to remove by all possible means the victims of the intervention policy which it is following together with the USA in a series of countries .
anti @-@ asylum legislation , the inhumane record numbers of asylum requests refused and mediaeval living conditions in immigration centres were not enough .
now it also aspires to keep anyone seeking asylum , seeking international protection , outside the ΕU .
only those who are obedient and organised are accepted as necessary at the altar of the &apos; competitiveness &apos; of the European monopolies .
the proposed &apos; Community @-@ wide system of resettlement &apos; is a mantle for public opinion to accept the creation of camps to round up immigrants outside the ΕU .
finally , the &apos; protected entry procedures &apos; promote non @-@ entry , in that asylum requests will be completed in a country outside the ΕU .
within the framework of the &apos; sharing of responsibilities &apos; between the ΕU and third countries , the burden of keeping immigrants until the deportation decision is formally received is being passed on to them .
the text is teeming with references to human rights , accompanied by proposals and policies which violate them .
coercive readmission clauses in agreements with third countries are advocated .
there is not a word on combating the causes for the waves of refugees .
a common foreign and security policy is advocated which will pay greater attention to &apos; conflict prevention &apos; ; in other words , which will fan the flames of the fire ignited by imperialism .
this report contains proposals and wordings that reflect a liberal attitude towards drugs .
we are thus voting against the proposal .
we are opposed to drugs being classified as &apos; soft &quot; or &apos; hard &quot; and to the fact that drugs described as &apos; soft &quot; are not regarded as addictive .
the &apos; alternative policy &quot; recommended in the report involves a more liberal policy towards drugs , emphasising harm reduction measures against drug use , rather than preventive work .
we are opposed to a common EU drugs policy . such a policy would involve countries with a restrictive drugs policy , such as Sweden , being forced to conduct a more lenient and liberal drugs policy .
it is up to each national Parliament in the EU to make decisions concerning their national drugs policies .
- Drug consumption is on the increase throughout Europe .
around 7.000 people die of overdoses every year in the European Union , and three times as many die as an indirect result of drug abuse ( suicide , violence , AIDS , road accidents , and so on ) .
it appears that Brussels wishes to tackle this scourge .
great , except that what it is proposing in the fight against drugs is not to prevent young people from taking drugs or to give drug addicts the means to come clean , but to make drug addiction more hygienic .
for example , it has tabled proposals for recovery rooms , rooms for injecting heroin under supervision and needle exchange programmes .
we cannot accept such a policy .
prevention is of course essential in the fight against drugs , but so is repression .
we should increase the penalties for drug dealers and introduce court orders for medical follow @-@ ups for users .
finally , we should not draw a distinction between soft drugs and hard drugs , as neither are harmless .
moreover , this over @-@ simplistic classification has led to a considerable increase in cannabis consumption .
we must not forget that there is scientific evidence linking the use of these drugs and mental health , with the occurrence of schizophrenia being between 30 % and 50 % higher in cannabis users .
.
I take the view that negotiations with Turkey should start as soon as Turkey complies with the political Copenhagen criteria , for example in relation to the protection of human and women &apos;s rights , the combating of corruption , the punishment of torture and the outlawing of child labour .
Turkey has made impressive progress in these areas , but it is apparent from the reports by non @-@ governmental organisations that it has not yet achieved these objectives .
the negotiations will be commenced with a view to acquiring Member State status , but if the conclusion seems appropriate that membership is not feasible , other forms of cooperation are possible .
. this is a commendable attempt to draw attention to the EU &apos;s increasing Drug problem and find solutions using a scientific and practical approach .
steps to combat the drugs trade would threaten one of the most important sources of income for organised crime and terrorist organisations .
for example , according to the Europol report on organised crime , drugs production and trafficking continue to be the main activity pursued by criminal groups in the EU .
no other field of organised crime is quite so profitable .
I welcome the view that a Community project should be launched for the purpose of introducing alternative forms of detention , so that drugs repression ceases to focus exclusively on imprisonment .
the anti @-@ drugs strategy should be regarded as a form of social intervention concentrating on the reasons for social unrest with a view to preventing drugs use by refining a strategy of repression which is currently targeted solely at drug users .
.
the European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for the Catania report on the EU drugs strategy because we believe it provides a comprehensive approach to tackling the harm done by particular drugs to individuals and to the spiral of crime , violence and trafficking caused by the trade in particular substances .
it addresses harm reduction , addiction and crime .
on Amendment 2 concerning the issue of the distribution of particular substances under controlled circumstances , the EPLP voted against both parts because we do not believe this amendment enhances the report or is in line with the UK Government &apos;s drugs strategy , which the EPLP fully supports .
.
the issue before us is the EU &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy that the Council decided to establish in June 2004 and that is set to be adopted at the next European Council .
this report goes against the grain of the EU &apos;s fundamental concepts , as it chooses to take the view that the strategy currently being implemented is not bearing fruit , that in some cases it has violated citizens &quot; rights and , accordingly , that a different path must be followed ; it even suggests that some drugs should be decriminalised .
furthermore - and this makes sense within the logic of the report - it takes the view that the subsidiarity principle is not very important in this area .
this is not my understanding of what the anti @-@ drugs strategy ought to be . I therefore voted against .
.
the fact that this report was passed so narrowly in the committee concerned shows that the rapporteur deviated from the European Strategy against drugs , by proposing a solution that , to my mind , does not solve the problem , but rather exacerbates it .
it is nothing new in this House to see Members try to put liberalisation forward as a solution , to see the notion of damage limitation as the be @-@ all @-@ and @-@ end @-@ all and to speak the language of surrender when it comes to drug trafficking .
this practice already has a notable history , with the common thread being that it is up to the Member States to enforce it - at complete variance with the subsidiarity principle , which must continue to apply to this issue - despite the need to coordinate the fight against drugs .
the slackness and decriminalisation that have been proposed are well known ways of removing responsibility from the public authorities and are a false ally of those whose drive and judgment have been subdued by the effects of drugs , and therefore constitute a deeply flawed message to give to the youngest members of society .
it is ironic that the rapporteur cites fundamental rights and claims to fight against an &apos; ideological approach &quot; to this subject , in order to justify a highly ideological position that , strictly speaking , runs counter to basic fundamental rights .
- On 16 and 17 December , the Council will decide on the new European Union Anti @-@ Drugs Strategy for 2005 @-@ 2012 .
a political agreement has already been reached in the Council , with no transparency or democratic scrutiny by Parliament .
indeed the Council has been very reluctant to meet our repeated demands for information about the progress of negotiations , even though we were discussing the same issue in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
today I voted in favour of Mr Catania &apos;s report , because the European Parliament has to show the Council what its vision of the new anti @-@ drugs strategy is for the years to come .
we note that the European strategy has achieved little to date , and at the same time , drug use has increased in Europe .
we therefore want to step up coordination and cooperation at European level so that Europe can bring added value to the fight against the scourge of drugs while respecting the principle of subsidiarity .
we must finally make the protection and health of drug users a priority .
we must therefore step up prevention , provide better care and enhance health policy so as to avoid human tragedies and reduce exclusion .
. - The European Parliament recommendation has not taken account of the recent annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addition , which demolishes the so @-@ called Dutch experiment and the argument that cannabis is allegedly harmless .
in the name of a non @-@ existent realism , the recommendation distorts the nature of the problem from a social to a medical problem , something which results in submission and defeatism .
the rapporteur endeavours to achieve the general application of the Dutch experiment through the back door , adopting the dangerous approach of dividing drugs into soft and hard .
he uses the word &apos; consumers &apos; instead of victims / users and proposes the creation of official drug administration centres .
as a consequence of this dangerous approach , all the proposals which detract from the primary concern - prevention - focus on damage limitation ( substitution programmes ) and look for solutions in the mechanisms and resources of the ΕU .
the connection between drug trafficking and the funding of so @-@ called terrorism gives arguments to imperialist propaganda and is becoming an alibi before the people .
we do not demonstrate any tolerance of the drug culture .
the reasons for drug addiction cannot be divided into &apos; hard &apos; and &apos; soft &apos; .
preventive and therapeutic measures and measures to reintegrate users are needed , together with a movement which will fight to overturn the social causes and the barbaric policy of capitalism which leads to drugs .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
the sitting is suspended .
Madam President , I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to the provisions of Rule 145 .
in view of the fact that a Member of the European Parliament has been grossly insulted , I have submitted a request to the President of the European Parliament to conduct an enquiry into information , which has been deliberately circulated in my country , Latvia , concerning my activities here at the European Parliament .
an employee at the Green Group secretariat has spread this false information .
he has voiced the opinion in mass media publications that my activities aroused such indignation amongst Members of the European Parliament that , in protest against me and my personal views , they left the Chamber .
this person described my accounts of my activities at the European Parliament as lies .
Madam President , none of this information is true .
I therefore request the leadership of the European Parliament to investigate this incident and to reinstate the truth about my European Parliament activities .
a Member of the European Parliament &apos;s job and duty is to work in the common interests of European democracy , truth and development .
every employee has these same duties regardless of their political convictions .
spreading lies or allowing them to be spread not only fails to promote the principle of legality , human rights and justice , but also discredits the European Parliament and its Members .
this cannot be permitted .
I request an investigation of these incidents .
thank you , Mr Kristovskis , for this personal statement .
the parliamentary services will investigate the matter you have raised and ascertain whether it is appropriate to launch an inquiry .
- The next item is the report ( A6 @-@ 0065 / 2004 ) by Mr Van Orden on Bulgaria &apos;s progress towards accession ( COM ( 2004 ) 0657 - C6 @-@ 0150 / 2004 - 2004 / 2183 ( INI ) ) .
. Madam President , it is almost nine years to the day since Bulgaria formally applied for membership of the European Union .
since then the country has undergone tremendous political and economic changes : it became a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
I see no significant obstacles to this and I trust that the European Council , when it meets at the end of this week , will not only endorse this view but also set a date early in the new year for signature of the Accession Treaty .
Bulgaria must be judged on its own merits and its progress should not necessarily be linked to that of any other candidate country .
that is why a separate Accession Treaty for Bulgaria may be necessary .
let us look at some of the changes that have taken place in Bulgaria .
on the one hand we can recognise that the accession criteria and deadlines set by the European Commission have provided an external catalyst for change .
however , on the other hand , internal dynamics have greatly altered the political and social landscape in Bulgaria as it cast off its old mantle following the collapse of communism in 1990 .
these changes are taking place not just because the European Union is insisting on them , but because they are good for Bulgaria and they are what the Bulgarians themselves want .
Bulgaria is now a fully functioning market economy and has been recognised as such since 2002 .
macroeconomic stability has been maintained , including adequate price stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts .
to take just a couple of key economic indicators , Bulgaria &apos;s GDP grew by 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 , up from 4.3 per cent in 2003 , and one of the highest rates among EU candidates and new Member States .
the unemployment rate has consistently fallen since 2002 : at 12 per cent it is still too high , but it is falling .
foreign direct investment is at record levels this year .
enormous progress has also been made on privatisation : 80 per cent of the economy is now in the private sector .
I strongly support the ongoing reform of Bulgaria &apos;s public administration , with the adoption of amendments to the Civil Service law .
improvements have also been made in the judicial system : there have been positive developments with regard to the recruitment and appointment of judges .
however , more needs to be done , in particular in relation to pre @-@ trial procedures and the position of the Prosecutor General .
however , it is not now just plain sailing .
there are still areas of concern that I have been highlighting since 1999 .
organised crime and corruption are an obstacle to reform in Bulgaria , having knock @-@ on effects in all sectors of the economy and society .
I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resources to be targeted to bring about major improvements in the welfare of children and in childcare institutions .
I have called for a well @-@ resourced , single government agency , with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens .
the same strategic approach must be adopted for the integration of the Roma community into Bulgarian society .
Bulgaria , assisted by the European Commission , must make an even more determined effort to expedite the integration of Roma into mainstream society , particularly through educational and employment opportunities , improved living conditions and access to healthcare and family planning .
there is also another side to this problem : the Roma themselves must adapt .
this point may be unpopular in some circles but it is the only way that real change will be brought about on the ground for the Roma .
over the past four years over EUR 160 million of Community funds have been directed at Roma issues .
however , change must happen from the inside as well as on the part of government .
the European Union &apos;s enlargement to the east and south @-@ east marks a momentous change in Europe .
we have finally put an end to the hostilities and the divisions of the Cold War .
history is being written as we speak - in Ukraine , for instance - and this morning Parliament gave its green light to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey .
great changes are taking place on our continent .
we are in a time of transition and we must all work hard to ensure that the tide of change shifts in the right direction .
within Europe this means refocusing the nature and objectives of the European Union .
this means the EU doing less but doing it better .
I wish to thank colleagues across Parliament for their support and assistance in my work as rapporteur .
there will be an opportunity for a more comprehensive report on Bulgaria &apos;s accession early in the new year .
my report this time is deliberately concise .
some amendments were included during the committee stage , but I do not feel that I can support any of the amendments now proposed .
finally , I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the plight of Bulgarian nurses incarcerated in Libya and now under threat of the death penalty .
I urge all Members to sign Written Declaration No 61 calling for their early release .
Bulgaria knows the challenges that lie ahead .
on 17 December I trust the European Council will formally conclude Bulgaria &apos;s negotiations and set the date for signature of the Accession Treaty in spring 2005 .
this will be a great achievement , but reform and change must continue both in Bulgaria and in the EU itself .
. Madam President , it is a great pleasure to be able to inform you formally that on 13 December 2004 the General Affairs Council closed the negotiations with Bulgaria .
we will now start the last , very important phase before entering the EU .
the remaining two years should be used to prepare thoroughly for membership .
the EU congratulates Bulgaria on this positive result , which has taken much effort and energy .
it is a new step towards a truly reunited Europe , based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law .
the negotiations with Bulgaria closed at the technical level in June 2004 .
this reflects the progress that the Bulgarian Government has made in recent years , which resulted in strong confidence on the part of all those involved and the ability to assume all membership obligations by January 2007 .
still , as the Committee on Foreign Affairs also states clearly in its motion for an EP resolution on Bulgaria &apos;s progress towards accession , we should closely monitor the progress which still has to be made by Bulgaria .
the commitments made in the Justice and Home Affairs chapter might need an amendment of the Constitution , which is a long and difficult process .
other important areas , as the Committee on Foreign Affairs states , are the quality of border management , the fight against corruption , and the prevention of abuse of powers by State authorities against persons entering or transiting Bulgaria .
the new penal code still has to be approved .
administrative capacity in a number of areas , including the agencies involved with the use of pre @-@ accession funds , should improve .
both in Bulgaria and in Romania , improvements in the standard of living should be a priority .
the economic growth that Bulgaria and Romania have seen in recent years has had a positive effect on purchasing power , but the effects at grass @-@ roots level , especially for the elderly , have remained limited .
there are at least two more years to go before accession .
an historic step will be made on 17 December when the negotiations regarding the fifth enlargement have come to an end .
monitoring of the last part of the fifth enlargement will continue until 2007 , in order to welcome the two new , long @-@ awaited members then ready to join the European Union .
as Mrs Kuneva said in October , she would like to publish the Monitoring Report on a big wall in Sofia in order to keep the process going .
I think Bulgaria has made good progress , which gives us confidence for the numerous tasks still remaining .
the Council looks forward to the finalisation of the Accession Treaty with a view to its signature in spring 2005 , after the Treaty has been submitted to the European Parliament .
.
Madam President , we have come a long way since Bulgaria applied for EU membership in 1995 and opened its negotiations in 2000 .
yesterday the EU finalised the accession negotiations with Bulgaria in the accession conference , with a view to accession on 1 January 2007 and with the signature of the accession Treaty in sight in the spring of next year .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constant and balanced support for Bulgaria &apos;s ambition to accede to the European Union and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Van Orden , for the sound and even @-@ handed report he has produced .
in the past few years Bulgaria has made steady progress in all areas in its preparation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria .
important and necessary decisions have been taken in this respect .
four units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant are being closed on agreed dates for final decommissioning , showing Bulgaria &apos;s determination to respect commitments .
substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts .
overall , Bulgaria has consolidated and deepened the stability of its institutions .
continuation on its current reform path should enable the country to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union .
we will , however , need to keep a close watch on some areas .
our intention now is to intensify our monitoring of the commitments that have been made and of continuing preparations in general , in order to ensure that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that Bulgaria will be effectively ready for membership in 2007 .
in this regard , solid efforts remain necessary concerning the reform of the judiciary , the fight against organised crime and the fight against corruption .
Bulgaria has made progress in gradually building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas .
as from November 2005 the Commission will issue yearly comprehensive monitoring reports for the Council and Parliament following the same methodology as was applied to the new Member States that joined the Union in May 2004 .
these reports will focus particularly on public administration , the judiciary and the fight against corruption , as well as the track record in economic reforms .
it is also necessary to take account of a longer period between completion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous waves of accession .
a specific safeguard was agreed , which allows the Commission to recommend to the Council to decide by unanimity , at any time , to postpone the date of accession by one year to January 2008 if there is clear evidence that Bulgaria is manifestly unprepared .
let me conclude by saying that I share the conclusions of the report of your rapporteur , Mr Van Orden , which are , by and large , in line with the 2004 regular report .
the Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgaria &apos;s progress towards accession .
Bulgaria is on track for accession on 1 January 2007 .
with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania , the fifth round of EU enlargement will be concluded .
thus the Black Sea will become a new coastline for an enlarged and unified Europe .
.
Madam President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , I would like to begin by pointing out that the financial pre @-@ accession aid granted to Bulgaria during 2000 @-@ 2004 has amounted to approximately EUR 178 million per year from the PHARE Programme , SAPARD and the ISPA instrument .
the Committee on Budgets also supports an additional sum from the PHARE Programme of EUR 200 million for 2000 @-@ 2006 for the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station .
it is also pleased that in Spring 2004 a new funding framework was established for Bulgaria and that the Commission has adopted a consistent approach by restricting the aid package to a period of three years from the accession of Bulgaria in 2007 so that we can adapt it to any future reforms of policies which may be necessary as a result of the new financial perspectives .
the Committee on Budgets stresses once again that financial aid will depend on the new financial perspectives , but also on the adaptation of the annual Budget , in accordance with those financial perspectives .
. Madam President , unlike Turkey , Bulgaria is quite clearly a European country which has made tremendous progress .
I was in Bulgaria in 1990 , when the country first attempted to hold free elections .
there was still some election @-@ rigging , but the democracy movement was impressive .
in many ways , it was reminiscent of the current situation in Ukraine .
Bulgaria has succeeded , step by step , in overcoming these crisis situations , and must now be taken seriously as a very promising candidate for accession to the European Union .
it has a rich culture and exerts a major stabilising influence over the entire Balkan peninsula .
although there is still a great deal to do - especially on the rule of law , justice and administration , where further reforms are required - Bulgaria is by far the most advanced of all the candidate countries , unless , that is , we forget a country which we should never forget , namely Croatia .
I would like to take this opportunity to appeal also to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council to accept Croatia at the forthcoming summit without any prevarication or special conditions , and to make massive efforts to ensure that the negotiations with Croatia are opened without delay .
both these countries should become members of the European Union before the decade is out , and Mr Van Orden &apos;s excellent report makes a major contribution to this process .
one of Bulgaria &apos;s particular achievements is the cross @-@ party cooperation established between Prime Minister Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha and the Bulgarian President , which is a prerequisite enabling Bulgaria to bring its progress towards EU membership to a successful conclusion in the coming years .
Bulgaria enjoys democratic stability at domestic level and is remaining resolute despite the crises affecting a number of areas , including the economy .
I would like to say how gratified I am by this development , and that Bulgaria is well on track .
I could sum up my speech in a single word : &apos; yes &quot; to Bulgaria .
. I would like to congratulate Mr van Orden on his outstanding report , which I believe is the fruit of much hard work , and I would like to thank the Commission &apos;s excellent work done with regard to candidate countries .
technically , Bulgaria has completed all the accession negotiation chapters and is clearly headed towards becoming a full member of the European Union in January 2007 .
according to the report , Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and the measures taken to successfully implement them have been effective .
however , this report also emphasises that there are still deficiencies that will inevitably have to be dealt with .
we believe that Bulgaria is on track for accession and will continue to make efforts to complete successfully the reforms it committed itself to in the near future .
these mainly include judicial reform and further increased efforts to counter organised crime and corruption .
the report welcomes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights , as a result of which the so @-@ called legislation on anti @-@ discrimination was adopted on January 1 , 2004 .
the report also emphasises the importance of the legislature &apos;s practical extension , as discrimination against Romany people remains widespread there .
the report acknowledges Bulgaria meeting the economic criteria and notes that it is a functioning market economy and at the time of accession will be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union .
the European Parliament and the Socialist Group will continue the monitoring system while ensuring that operations are run efficiently and obligations are fulfilled .
based on Bulgaria &apos;s reform efforts and progress , the Socialist Group hopes that Bulgaria will sign and ratify the accession treaty as soon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 2007 .
.
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , my group also views Bulgaria &apos;s progress towards accession as a success story , albeit with a few necessary caveats on points of detail .
we therefore believe that this House can vote in favour of Bulgaria accession to the European Union in 2007 with a clear conscience .
we support Mr Van Orden &apos;s report and speaking personally , I would like to thank him and Mrs Dobolyi from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the good cooperation .
as Mr Van Orden himself has said , he has deliberately kept the report brief .
I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments , some of which are very detailed , next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due .
Bulgaria is well on track to join the European Union in 2007 .
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight a fundamental problem , namely that of genuine compliance with the principle of merit .
the Commission and the Council have both stated that each candidate &apos;s accession should be based on individual merit .
however , this is incompatible with a situation in which a candidate country which fulfils the criteria is held back by the slower progress made by other countries .
the countries making swifter progress thus accede too late while the candidates making slower progress join too early .
to put it simply , the good performers are being penalised while the laggards are being rewarded .
this situation must change .
the credibility of the Union as a whole is damaged if its practices conflict with the principle of merit .
Commissioner Verheugen amply demonstrated this with the &apos; big bang &apos; enlargement in May this year , which damaged the Union .
a better option would have been for well @-@ performing candidates , such as Estonia and Slovenia , to have been able to join much earlier .
for this reason alone , namely to preserve the European Union &apos;s credibility and not because there is any doubt about the European prospect of either of the two candidates , my group has always been in favour of separate accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania .
Mr Watson reaffirmed this position this morning in this Chamber .
I therefore urge the Commission and the Council , but also my fellow Members in this House , to ensure , during present and future enlargement rounds , that the principle of merit is not just proclaimed with pomp and ceremony , only to be ignored in favour of package deals , but is actually implemented in practice .
in this context , a gratifying sign is the Council &apos;s decision to adopt differentiated approaches to Bulgaria and Romania in the chapters on competition and justice .
simplifying the mechanism to invoke the safeguard clause in the case of Romania will enhance the credibility of the accession process and thus the credibility of the European Union itself .
on a more general note , I believe that we should be conducting this debate not in Strasbourg , but in Brussels .
. Madam President , Bulgaria will become a Member State with many unresolved issues .
old environmental problems , resulting from mining and nuclear waste , are still left unresolved .
much damage is being done by construction work for new roads through protected scenic areas and by the expansion of the largest airport .
these days , poor maintenance , decay and poverty are noticeable throughout Bulgaria .
the Roma people are still lagging behind and disadvantaged .
EU funding for the benefit of projects for this group of people is divided and spent in a contentious manner .
in the minds of many Bulgarians , the nearby Greek and Roman coasts belong , in fact , to Bulgaria , just as do the greater part of the Republic of Macedonia and a few areas on the border with Serbia .
the fact that the Bulgarian electorate still has not made any steady choices is apparent from the rapid changes within the two main rivalling political parties , and , above all , from the fact that a newcomer to the most recent general elections achieved almost the majority of the votes .
shortly after the surprising election as Prime Minister of the country &apos;s former King , the candidate of the Communists &quot; successors was elected President .
this instability has , however , produced one positive development in the form of greater involvement in political decision @-@ making of the Turkish minority , which was discriminated against in the past .
unlike in Romania , the problems in Bulgaria are no bigger than those in a number of the present EU Member States .
that is why it is right to allow Bulgaria full EU membership from 2007 .
there is a strong historical and linguistic bond between Bulgaria and the Slavonic @-@ speaking part of Macedonia .
in 1878 , last @-@ minute Western European intervention prevented the two from uniting .
it would be useful if the negotiations about Macedonia &apos;s accession - for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has appointed me as rapporteur - were to run parallel with Croatia , which also has its roots in former Yugoslavia , so that we can welcome the Bulgarians and Macedonians to the European Union simultaneously .
- Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope Mr Posselt will praise me as well shortly .
I am not overly keen on the black @-@ and @-@ white film presented by the European Commission entitled &apos; Romania the bad and Bulgaria the good . &quot;
black @-@ and @-@ white films are not popular either in politics or in real life .
not everything is as bad in Romania and as good in Bulgaria as would appear from the picture painted by the European Commission &apos;s amateur artists .
it is true that Bulgaria has made progress and that it should join the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
at the same time , however , Bulgaria has not done many of the things it should have done .
I should like to refer to a number of specific points .
firstly , what use is there in Bulgarian legislation complying with EU legislation , if implementation of this legislation continues to lag behind ?
secondly , trade in human beings , in particular in women and children , is still a serious problem .
as a third point , the adoption system and its lack of transparency , as well as the situation in Bulgarian orphanages and special schools , continue to be a cause for concern .
fourthly , there are also concerns with regard to the situation of adults in psychiatric hospitals , and this is included in Parliament &apos;s motion for a resolution .
as a fifth point , the continuing lack of reform of the judicial system , which lags a long way behind European standards , is an Achilles &quot; heel for Sofia .
the sixth point I should like to refer to is the widespread corruption , which is a thorn in Bulgaria &apos;s side as it enters the EU , given that it affects various areas and levels of government and is apparent at every turn .
during the past few weeks I have visited Bulgaria twice , and my remarks are by no means merely quotes from reports , but reflect what is plain for everyone to see .
the seventh point is organised crime .
the Bulgarian Government is acting like the choir in a Chinese opera , where the choir sings &apos; let &apos;s run away , let &apos;s run away &quot; for three acts , but stays in the same place the whole time .
the Bulgarian Government constantly repeats that it is taking measures to fight the mafia , but it would appear that it is mainly conducting a war of words .
the mafia continues to be a serious problem .
at the same time , however , the EU also sometimes takes measures that the Bulgarian public finds incomprehensible .
for example , it recently demanded that a power plant in Kozloduj be shut down , even though enormous amounts of Bulgarian taxpayers &quot; money had been spent on modernising it in recent years .
in conclusion , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , despite these reservations we should welcome the fact that our European family is to be joined by a nation with a history dating back over 1300 years .
Bulgaria &apos;s history is longer than many of the present EU Member States .
I should like to bid Bulgaria welcome to somewhere it should have been for many years .
I am sure Bulgaria will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of homelands .
- Madam President , I should like by way of introduction to make the members of the European Parliament privy to the hostage @-@ taking in Athens today , to the hijacking of a bus with innocent citizens on their way to work .
I mention this in order to highlight the need to formulate an efficient policy at European level on urban security .
now to the subject in hand .
Bulgaria made noteworthy progress in converting to a pluralistic democracy and functional market economy in keeping with European instructions at both political and economic level .
the integration of Bulgaria into the European Union in 2007 , in conjunction with its recent admission to ΝΑΤΟ , is a particularly positive development both for Bulgaria itself and for south @-@ eastern Europe as a whole .
I trust that the case of Bulgaria will also set an example for the countries of the Western Balkans as they move towards Europe .
nonetheless , it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constant and conscious effort on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to adapt pending full integration .
further efforts should focus on stamping out corruption and efficiently combating organised crime .
I should like at this point to call on the European Commission , within the framework of the Community policy on border regions with candidate countries , to draft a new study on the repercussions which the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will have on the border regions of the Member States .
I would remind you in this context that the European Commission itself , in the person of the competent Commissioner , Mr Verheugen , found that regions such as north @-@ eastern Greece , which border on two countries , face by far the most difficult situation at European level .
the policies and actions of the European Union to promote trans @-@ national , trans @-@ regional and cross @-@ border cooperation and to combat the repercussions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinforced .
similarly , special care must be taken when distributing resources and preparing programmes for territorial cooperation in the new 2007 @-@ 2013 programming period .
Madam President , it is the case that Bulgaria &apos;s capacity to comply with the Community has increased considerably and is continuing to do so .
nevertheless , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy wishes to stress that in the sectors of research and development , energy , industrial policy and telecommunications policy an additional effort is required if we want the incorporation of Bulgaria to be an historic success , since the accession date is now getting very close .
furthermore , in order correctly to assess the progress made and thereby propose the changes still to be made , we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission , but also of the assessments of the different international bodies and other independent research centres , whose opinion may be of great assistance in analysing and evaluating Bulgaria &apos;s capacity in these areas , with a view to its incorporation into the European Union .
in any event , our current views with regard to each of the sectors which are the responsibility of our committee are as follows : with regard to energy policy , Bulgaria - as has already been said - currently depends on nuclear energy to cover its internal needs , but the reality is that its nuclear power stations are technically obsolete and the dismantling of some of them has been very expensive .
as has also been pointed out , it is now proposed to modernise units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy power station , and additional funds will be required for this , since the European Union &apos;s contributions are clearly insufficient .
funds from international donors are required , though we are not seeing the government prioritise this issue as it should do .
in the telecommunications sector , the independence of the regulatory authority should be guaranteed , and it should have the power to resolve commercial disputes and guarantee the principle of universality , in accordance with Community legislation .
it is also necessary to reformulate industrial and business policy and improve the administrative capacity to facilitate the work of small and medium @-@ sized businesses , which are the true creators of jobs and an extraordinary source of technological innovation .
with regard to the research sector , despite Bulgaria &apos;s participation in the Sixth Framework Programme , its presence has been very limited .
Madam President , this is essentially the content of the amendment our committee is presenting to the report we are debating .
- Madam President , Minister , Commissioner , congratulations to the rapporteur and congratulations to Bulgaria as well .
it has closed all the chapters and is an example and an inspiration to all its neighbours .
I repeat , to all its neighbours .
it would be an even better example if it took just one more step in its relationship with its minorities and did the same for the other minorities living in Bulgaria as it has already done for the Turkish minority . &apos; the Balkans , that ancient mountain range , &quot; as the Bulgarian national anthem goes , and the word &apos; Balkans &quot; as a political problem does not apply in the case of Bulgaria .
Bulgaria already belongs to Western Europe and it is the Western Balkans that we will have to deal with in the future .
this is why I feel that it is important that when we are talking about Bulgaria , we should also pay some attention to Macedonia , which has already submitted its application for membership of the European Union and that the European Union itself should also take another step forward .
the USA has recognised Macedonia by the name that it chose for itself .
we still continue to use the name FYROM and it is high time we took another step forward because this would also be a great step towards the Europeanisation of this area .
in an hour and a half &apos;s time , Commissioner , you will be meeting a delegation from Serbia and Montenegro .
this is the delegation &apos;s first visit to the European Parliament and I believe that the example of Bulgaria should be used as an inspiration for all its neighbours to do more for the future prospects and stability of this part of the world .
therefore it seems to me that we could all learn more from Bulgaria and that Bulgaria &apos;s principal neighbour could learn a lot .
I am talking about Turkey , a country we have supported today in saying &apos; yes &quot; to the start of negotiations .
Bulgaria is the last country on the road to Turkey and I believe that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to perform in this respect , should support all of these countries so that they can participate fully both economically and politically and bring about a further enlargement of the European Union .
-Madam President , both the resolutions and opinions of the Commission and the Council giving the go @-@ ahead for the integration of Bulgaria and Romania in future years clearly set out the objectives of European capital , which are already being realised , to annex these countries , plunder their wealth and their economy , exploit their workers to an unbelievable degree and convert them to NATO satellites , so that they can serve its aggressive policy .
the resolutions record , to a degree , certain aspects of the wretched and inhumane living conditions of the working classes in these countries and the poor grass @-@ roots classes , but these are the result of the restoration of capitalism , which is eroding all the social rights achieved and , on the other hand , is concentrating wealth in the hands of a new plutocracy and foreign monopolies .
there are in fact two Bulgarias and two Romanias : on the one hand , the countries of luxury for the new plutocrats in Bulgaria and Romania and the foreigners who are literally plundering these countries and , on the other , the countries of two proud nations literally being dragged into misery and humiliation .
the consequences of the integration process and of the humiliating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visible .
you spoke to us of successes .
so listen to the successes : in Bulgaria , the minimum wage is EUR 61 and in Romania it is EUR 69 , compared with EUR 1.173 in France and EUR 605 in Greece .
the rapid increase in imports , in conjunction with plummeting exports , has resulted in increased deficits .
purchasing power in Romania is 60 % of what it was in 1989 .
industry has been destroyed and agricultural production is operating below par .
the objective of the new direction proposed in the resolutions and the new measures is to create better conditions , an institutional framework and infrastructures for the most unaccountable action by capital , the complete selling off of public property and land and the abolition of any social rights achieved .
the workers in these countries , together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe , must fight against the policy of the European Union and , more importantly , against the new tensions expected in the area as a result of the serious rivalry which is beginning to manifest itself .
Madam President , this debate is , actually , a token of congratulation to Bulgaria , although it goes without saying that it still has many problems , and much remains to be dealt with .
a great deal , of course , still needs to be done in the field of human rights and human trafficking , but they are doing their level best , which was not evident before .
it is for that reason that I believe that Bulgaria should be able to join the European Union in 2007 .
they belong among us .
I would also like to see more attention given to a debate about Bulgaria &apos;s accession than to one about Turkey &apos;s .
after all , Bulgaria is a truly European country , straddling the old and new Europe , and deserves all our attention .
I can foresee some problems with regard to its accession .
while there are , of course , problems in Bulgaria itself , the biggest may well be in the European Union .
the fact is that funding for its accession is not yet completely in place .
after 2007 , we will be talking about the financial perspective up to 2013 , and I am surprised at the discussion that is being held in the Council and elsewhere , in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1 % of the gross domestic product .
if you look at all the forecasts that have been made , funding for Bulgaria &apos;s accession is nowhere to be found .
I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission , which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1 % .
if , however , we look at the proposals for agriculture , for example , we notice that those do not include a budget for agriculture in Bulgaria , while the development of the countryside in Bulgaria will play a key role in the development of that country itself .
anyone who loves the countryside , loves the country itself and actually does something for the future of that country .
I am therefore interested to hear how the Council intends to fund this accession and how we can ensure in a correct and proper manner that Bulgaria becomes a truly European country in 2007 .
I should like to finish off with another point .
in the responses by the Confederal Group of the United Left / Nordic Green Left - which does , after all , comprise quite a few former Communists - I was struck by the fact that people have some difficulty with the major political changes in Bulgaria .
to those people , I have this to say .
the Bulgarians have a better grasp of politics than your group , and do you know why ?
they judge politicians by their actions , which may lead to major shifts .
I am pleased to see that the Bulgarians , in terms of democratic thinking , are further advanced than many Members from the GUE / NGL Group .
- Madam President , I should like , now that accession negotiations have been concluded with Bulgaria , for us to start by highlighting and welcoming the huge efforts made by the Bulgarian people and the political forces in the country to push ahead with changes and reforms and incorporate the .
the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will close the circle of enlargement opened with the ten new countries .
it is a development of strategic importance which unites the Balkans and Europe and will contribute to peace , stability , cooperation and development in the area as a whole .
however , I should like to underline a number of crucial points both to the Commission and to the Presidency .
during the next stage , Bulgaria will need to step up its efforts to apply the in four sectors which are of particular importance to the European Union and to Greece :
the first is the sector of environmental protection , nuclear safety , nuclear waste management and the quality of river water .
reactors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 2006 , in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgarian authorities , and modernisation of nuclear installations with Community financing from the PHARE programme and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must continue normally .
in the sector of labour relations and labour law , additional reforms are needed for Bulgaria to approach European standards and overturn social exclusion practices which affect Community - and especially Greek - undertakings in border regions , where there is a serious problem with relocations .
furthermore , deficits are recorded in the three sectors of combating organised crime , trafficking in human beings and controlling external borders and combating illegal immigration .
finally , I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedures and greater transparency in the sector of public procurement and public works are needed , as is the safeguarding of equal treatment of all Community undertakings , including Greek undertakings .
the European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for , with annual evaluation reports and safeguarding clauses , to monitor closely the efficient application of the and safeguard Community interests , even after the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 .
. Madam President , I appreciate the positive remarks from Members of Parliament with regard to the accession of Bulgaria .
Mr Posselt , Mr Maat , Mrs Dobolyi and others were clear on that issue .
Members said that there are still a lot of concerns .
that is true .
that is precisely the reason why we have the framework , the procedure , with extra monitoring and an extra benchmark and , if necessary , an extra sanction , an extra safeguard for an extra year before the moment of accession .
with regard to the financial issue raised by Mr Maat and others , I do not think we need to be concerned .
the financial consequences of accession are already covered in the so @-@ called financial package for the years 2007 @-@ 09 .
that is irrespective of the new financial perspective .
an important issue that was raised again today is the importance of having an individual approach to different countries .
you know the formal position - one treaty for Romania and Bulgaria .
it is important , and necessary , to differentiate .
that is precisely what we want to do in the wording of the conclusions next Thursday or Friday in the Council , concentrating on the different chapters .
if necessary we can differentiate at the moment of actual accession , because there is the possibility of postponing accession for a maximum of one year .
I thank the rapporteur , Mr Van Orden , for his adequate and balanced report .
I really welcome its conclusions .
. Madam President , I promise to speak slowly and unhurriedly .
I wish to say thank you for the pertinent debate and those points of view expressed which , in the main , support the Commission &apos;s recommendations .
I will respond to just a couple of the most central issues .
I will speak first about the coupling of Romania and Bulgaria .
it is true that a joint Accession Treaty is being drafted for these countries . on the other hand , as Mr Nicolaï very clearly explained , each is being treated according to a differentiated approach , especially now the process is in its last stages and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assessed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfilled before these countries can accede to the Union .
I would also like to emphasise that Bulgaria is not yet ready for membership either : much work is being asked of it , but , at the same time , Bulgaria has all the potential to fulfil its commitments to enable it to accede to the Union on 1 January 2007 .
I will speak next about corruption , which has attracted much attention in speeches .
that is quite right and I agree with those views expressed .
Bulgaria has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against corruption .
it is particularly concerned with improving border controls , developing the work of the traffic police and the institutions in general , and countering corruption in Bulgaria &apos;s administration .
this is in fact the main focus of Sub @-@ Programme 4 under the PHARE programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years , in 2005 and 2006 .
thirdly and finally , I wish to talk about the status of minorities , and especially that of the Roma .
in Bulgaria , new legislation against discrimination has recently been passed and has entered into force there .
it took effect in January of this year and it is presently being implemented in conjunction with an anti @-@ discriminatory action programme to improve the status of minorities .
we are very closely monitoring this new legislation and the implementation of the action programme to support it .
I am also pleased that other European organisations , such as the Council of Europe , in the building next to ours , is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Roma .
we would all certainly have been present at the opening ceremony of the Council of Europe &apos;s Roma Forum at 12 noon today , but at the same time we were debating , and you were voting on , the very important report on Turkey , so , unfortunately , we could not get there .
I wish to thank the European Parliament for its support and counsel , and I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Van Orden , and Bulgaria , which hopefully will become an example to the entire Balkan region .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
the next item is the report ( A6 @-@ 0061 / 2004 ) by Mr Moscovici , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on Romania &apos;s progress towards accession &#91; 2004 / 2184 ( INI ) &#93; .
I should like to invite Mr Moscovici to take the floor , and to inform him that he may speak for five minutes .
- Mr President , the political context in which I am tabling this report has become clearer in recent weeks .
last week the Commission was able to close accession negotiations with Romania on the last two chapters , namely justice and home affairs , and competition .
moreover , legislative elections and then presidential elections have also been held in recent weeks , putting a different political party in power under conditions that have been recognised by all of the parties .
this information obviously does not change the philosophy and general thrust of the report .
I wanted to draft and submit a balanced report to the House , that is to say a report that was both rigorous and clear , because Romania &apos;s situation poses many problems . yet I also wanted it to be a friendly report , because we all want Romania and Bulgaria to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession .
on this basis , we are proposing that we both take note of Romania &apos;s progress towards accession and also remain aware of its limits and shortcomings , and the extent of the work that remains to be done .
these two aspects , the limits and the progress , are actually set out for each of the areas in question .
they are presented first with regard to the political criteria , and it is there without any doubt that the main difficulties lie .
there are limits to the progress made ; for example , the reform of the civil service does not go far enough , the use of emergency ordinances is not desirable and quite excessive , and as for legislative procedures , everyone knows that they are not perfect .
but over and above this limited progress , a number of problems , serious problems , remain as far as freedoms are concerned .
I am thinking firstly of the freedom of information and expression , which is denied to a great many journalists .
I am thinking of the judicial system , which despite initial improvements is unquestionably in need of further attention .
I am thinking , of course , of corruption , which is still endemic in Romania , even at high levels .
on all of these problems - freedom of expression , corruption , the judicial and police systems - I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to be absolutely uncompromising .
at the same time , we cannot ignore the fact that progress has undoubtedly been made .
the Commission has recognised that Romania satisfies the Copenhagen political criteria ; the country has embarked on public administration reform , and constitutional reform is also underway .
the judicial system , as I have said , is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection - requested by our own Parliament , incidentally - even though it is possible to go further .
overall then , I believe that Romania has listened to the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament , in particular those that were made at the instigation of the previous rapporteur , Mrs Nicholson .
we find the same problem with the economic criteria : there are limits to the progress made , macroeconomic stability is not yet guaranteed and poverty remains at quite excessive levels .
at the same time , we have seen progress in the fight against social exclusion , in the fight against poverty and in the adoption of legislation on social protection .
the third and final area is everything to do with the .
as I said at the outset , negotiations on this are complete . moreover , I do not believe that it would be wise to reopen them , although I have read that the newly @-@ elected president intends to do so .
for my part , I think that the treaty should first be ratified and signed before it is renegotiated .
we need , however , to implement the legislation that has been adopted , in particular that relating to the free movement of goods and capital , financial control , the environment , industrial production , regional policy and issues of justice and home affairs .
this assessment , which I hope is balanced , is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending , and they are as follows : as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty - I repeat , a joint treaty - being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007 .
clearly this is a political decision , but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close watch on developments through all of the follow @-@ up actions and other reports that we can table here .
a final word on the amendments tabled : we did a good job , in my opinion , in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which enabled the report to be adopted by a very large majority .
the remaining amendments to the report fall into two categories .
there are those that improve the substance of the report , in particular on social protection , human rights , the disabled , the protection of children and young people , and recommendations on industrial policy , and I am obviously in favour of these .
then there are other amendments that call into question the existence of a joint accession treaty or which change the nature and balance of the report , which clearly I do not support .
this morning we made the historic decision to open negotiations with Turkey .
I believe that concluding them with Romania and Bulgaria , and with Romania in particular , is , in contrast , a logical decision , and people would not understand if we did not do both of these things together .
. Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to be able to inform you here formally that on 14 December 2004 the General Affairs Council also closed the negotiations with Romania .
as I said when referring to Bulgaria , it is a new step towards a really reunited Europe based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law .
I will elaborate briefly on the process of closing the last challenging chapters with Romania and focus on the monitoring system developed to ensure a proper start for Romania within the European Union .
the two remaining chapters , which have been regarded as the most difficult ones - competition policy , and justice and home affairs - were technically closed by the General Affairs Council on 14 December 2004 .
I believe we have been able to find appropriate solutions for all the issues raised in those final weeks through close and constructive cooperation between the Commission and the Council .
however , closing these two chapters means that the real work continues for the Romanians .
over the next two years Romania will have to make real and sustained efforts in order to be truly ready for membership .
good intentions are not enough : these must be matched by progress on the ground , in particular in the implementation of commitments .
the EU will of course continue to support the preparations at all levels : the Commission will enhance the monitoring of progress commitments undertaken in all areas of the .
we learned from representatives of both governments that monitoring systems helped them very much in continuing , and even intensifying , the reforms needed .
on competition policy , this chapter is at the core of the internal market and European economic integration .
the proper enforcement of EU competition rules is a precondition for creating a reliable business environment and requires appropriate administrative capacity .
this is a long @-@ term process .
it is for those reasons that competition discipline is also a key aspect of the Europe agreement .
other key aspects are legislative alignment and the institutional and administrative structures in Romania .
what needs to be done to bring all legislation , including secondary legislation , into line with the requirements in the areas of antitrust and State aid , in particular in relation to fiscal aid ?
the Romanian Competition Council should be given the powers , resources and the well @-@ trained staff it needs to fulfil its role .
this Council should prohibit any measures which would be in contradiction with the State aid and the Europe agreement .
let me turn to the steel sector , which is a sensitive sector across the EU .
Romania has asked for a prolongation of the so @-@ called &apos; grace period &apos; under the Europe agreement for restructuring the steel industry .
again , we only agreed to this now it is clear that Romania will abide by all the commitments and all the conditions set out in the EU &apos;s position .
these commitments include drawing up a national restructuring programme as well as an individual business plan , capacity reduction and dismantling of the installations .
the European Union expects Romania to respect all its commitments and take all the necessary measures within the deadlines laid down in the EU &apos;s position .
in this context , I should recall the safeguards we have at our disposal .
in October 2005 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assessing Romania &apos;s progress in the area of competition policy .
any serious shortcomings observed in this report regarding Romania &apos;s obligations under the Europe agreement and / or the fulfilment of the commitments can form the basis for a recommendation by the Commission to invoke safeguards , in particular the one postponing Romania &apos;s accession by one year .
here the Council can decide by a qualified majority .
on this understanding , I have come to the conclusion that this chapter does not require further negotiations .
let me say that it is now in Romania &apos;s hands to ensure that it meets all its commitments in this chapter , allowing Romania &apos;s smooth integration into the European Union .
turning to justice and home affairs , this is a chapter which is both extensive and complex .
it is at the heart of our objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom , security and justice .
it has a direct bearing on the lives of every EU citizen , and is therefore a key part of the which must be respected .
negotiations on this chapter have been long and detailed .
Romania has made a considerable number of firm commitments on all areas of the justice and home affairs .
there are several areas to which particular attention should be paid , such as implementation of the Schengen action plan ; ensuring a high level of control and surveillance at the external borders of the Union ; implementing the reform of the judiciary ; stepping up the fight against corruption to ensure that corruption cases are dealt with in a swift and transparent manner ; making considerable progress in filling the large number of vacancies in the police forces ; as well as developing and implementing a coherent multiannual anti @-@ crime strategy .
these issues have also been addressed in Mr Moscovici &apos;s report on Romania .
the Union will closely monitor Romania &apos;s implementation of all its commitments related to justice and home affairs , right up to the moment of accession in order to meet EU standards .
this includes adhering to the planned legislative schedule and taking further measures to develop the institutional and administrative capacity of all Romanian law enforcement authorities and of the judiciary .
we believe that this should be possible if the necessary political effort , as well as the required financial and human resources , are deployed to this end .
if , however , any serious shortcomings are observed in the fulfilment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments listed in the EU position , this can form the basis for invoking the safeguard clause postponing Romania &apos;s accession by one year .
here again , the Council can decide by qualified majority .
the European Union will continue to monitor closely Romania &apos;s preparations and achievements , including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the and in particular the areas of justice and home affairs , competition and the environment .
to this end , the Commission will continue to submit annual reports on Romania &apos;s progress towards accession , together with recommendations if appropriate .
I welcome the statement in the report by Mr Moscovici that the European Parliament will monitor the developments in Romania as well and encourage the new Romanian Government to fulfil all the commitments made during the negotiations .
it is quite clear that the report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2004 has fulfilled its purpose as a wake @-@ up call to the Romanian Government .
that is how the Romanian Government has perceived it ; and it has convinced it to intensify the accession strategy and policies .
I was delighted to learn that Parliament , in its latest report about Romania , could subscribe to the recommendations of the regular report of the Commission .
since then - and I paraphrase the wording of the Commission - we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004 , on the basis of its own merits , with a view to signing the Accession Treaty as early as possible in 2005 , and we all expect Bulgaria and Romania to fulfil the economic and criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007 .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to thank Mr Moscovici for tabling a report that is both balanced and in @-@ depth .
the Commission has always warmly welcomed the European Parliament &apos;s constructive engagement in the process of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union .
I should also like to thank the Council for its productive cooperation .
Mr President , your report of March 2004 was a real &apos; wake @-@ up call &apos; for Romania .
being tough and very demanding , it finally helped to bring about further progress in the accession negotiations .
it led , with the Commission &apos;s impetus , to a series of reforms , which were listed in Romania &apos;s famous &apos; To Do List &apos; , under which the Romanian authorities put greater emphasis on improving political and economic governance .
as Mr Nicolaï said , the Union will now finalise the accession negotiations with Romania on Friday .
however , I underline that concluding the negotiations does not mean the end of the work .
on the contrary , the two @-@ year period to 2007 must be used by Romania to become a full @-@ fledged Member State : plenty of hard work , commitment and especially delivery is needed .
we will carry out an enhanced monitoring of compliance with the commitments entered into and of ongoing preparations in general .
for Romania and Bulgaria , we have agreed a new safeguard clause covering the period between closure of the negotiations and actual accession .
this clause provides for the postponement of accession by one year if there is clear evidence that Romania will be manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership .
the Member States could then activate the suspension clause by unanimity , on the basis of the Commission &apos;s recommendation .
let me also point out that in the chapter concerning competition and state aids , the Commission was not able to propose a provisional closure of negotiations .
however , the Council , due to earlier political commitments , chose to close the negotiations by the end of 2004 .
moreover , in regard to justice and home affairs , the Council asked for more reassuring enforcement mechanisms .
therefore , in close cooperation with the Netherlands presidency , the Commission worked out a proposal for a reinforced monitoring mechanism linked to safeguard clauses in these two areas : justice and home affairs , and competition and state aids .
in these areas , the suspension clause can be activated by a qualified majority of the Member States , which gives it stronger credibility than if it were only activated by unanimity .
I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause .
should the monitoring by the Commission show that Romania is not properly prepared for membership , we should not hesitate to recommend that the Council invoke this suspension clause .
to be absolutely clear : the aim of this clause is not to penalise Romania , but to protect Romania and the EU Member States from any negative effects that Romania &apos;s possible manifest unpreparedness for membership might entail .
before closing , let me briefly touch upon the political situation in Romania .
I know that Parliament is concerned about alleged irregularities in the parliamentary and presidential elections that recently took place in Romania .
I am also aware of the assessments made by several Romanian NGOs .
however , I would like to recall that the OSCE election assessment team stated that overall the administration of the Romanian elections &apos; seemed professional and efficiently organised &apos; .
I also note that the OSCE has assessed the overall conduct of the election as satisfactory in the second round .
moreover , both presidential candidates accepted the final results of the presidential elections .
I trust - and this is important for the European Union as well as for Romania - that the new president @-@ elect and the forthcoming government in formation will be determined to continue with the reforms that are needed for Romania to accede to the European Union .
that is very much in the interest of Romania and Romanians .
let me conclude by saying that I endorse the conclusions of the report by your rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , which are , in general , in line with the 2004 Regular Report .
the Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of Romania &apos;s progress towards accession .
.
Mr President , the Committee on Budgets would like to point out that the financial pre @-@ accession aid granted to Romania in 2004 has amounted to EUR 825 million , which comes from the national PHARE programme and the SAPARD and ISPA instruments .
I would also like to point out that the total volume of this aid is approximately equivalent to 1.4 % of the country &apos;s GDP .
as in the case of Bulgaria , the Committee on Budgets is pleased about the establishment in spring 2004 of the new funding framework for the accession of Romania .
it is also pleased that , as for Bulgaria , the Commission has proposed restricting this package of aid to a period of three years in order that it may be adapted to the future political needs stemming from the new financial perspectives that are going to be approved .
all of the financial aid will depend on these new financial perspectives , but from 2009 .
unlike what happened in the case of the report on Bulgaria , in this case the Committee on Budgets wishes to stress the need to make sustained efforts to enhance Romania &apos;s administrative capacity with regard to the essential fields of customs , VAT and statistics on gross domestic product .
this means having appropriate capacity to collect and control VAT and customs duties , and to calculate gross domestic product credibly , precisely and exhaustively , in accordance with the SEC 95 rules .
.
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , on the excellent work he has done on this report on Romania .
I would also like to thank him for his open attitude and his spirit of compromise .
Mr President , in the last two years , Romania has made very significant progress on its journey towards integration with the European Union .
I naturally welcome this progress .
a decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday .
the closure of these negotiations is expected to be confirmed at the European Council this week , but it is clear that the work is not over .
in fact , Romania has important work to do before the accession scheduled for 2007 can take place .
I am not only talking about the procedures necessary for full ratification of the Treaty ; it must also intensify its efforts in a series of essential areas .
to this end , it must carry out the reforms in the field of public administration , it must improve judicial administration and ensure that it is independent - a field in which it adopted an important legislative package a few months ago ; it must enhance the fight against corruption , a serious problem which continues to affect the country .
and efforts are also needed in the field of preserving the environment .
in short , the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts .
Mr President , my position and the report essentially consists of the following : on the one hand , an open and positive view of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union within the scheduled timescale .
on the other hand , a demanding position in relation to the efforts Romania must make , which will require determination and perseverance .
I believe that this is the clear twin message that the Romanian authorities now in office following the elections of recent days must receive .
through this report , the European Parliament is saying yes to the integration of Romania , but it will be monitoring that country &apos;s compliance with all of its commitments .
this Parliament must follow the efforts the Romanian authorities must make very closely .
we are also counting on the information that the Commission must send out regularly to us in this regard , as the Commissioner has pointed out .
finally , on this journey Romania still has to make towards accession , it can count on our vigilance , but , of course , it can also count on our assistance and our impetus .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and well balanced report .
the report mentions both the positive and the negative aspects , the strong points and the weak points , which Romania will have to address .
on the positive side , the report clearly states that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria , that it has strengthened the stability of its institutions that guarantee State democracy and human rights , and that the situation has improved in the field of protection of human and ethnic rights , with regard to both the Hungarian minority and the Roma minority .
on the positive side , Romania also fulfils the criterion of a functioning market economy and , moreover , has implemented and is continuing to implement a programme of structural reforms .
if we look at the economic results , the economic statistics for Romania , we can see that the country has one of the strongest growth rates in the whole of Eastern Europe .
naturally , Romania still has to make considerable efforts and make significant progress , however , before it can be accepted into the European Union .
both Mr Nicolaï and Mr Rehn have referred to certain aspects in detail .
I should like to mention a few of them : the areas of justice and internal affairs , like everywhere in Eastern Europe , the fight against corruption and against organised crime , and also border controls .
problems also remain in the fields of economic competition , of state support and , of course , of protecting the natural environment .
in spite of everything , however , I believe that Romania is well on the way .
it is up to Romania and Romania alone as to whether it will manage to eliminate all the weak points in the coming months .
if it does succeed , I am of the opinion that the treaty should be signed in 2005 so that Romania , along with Bulgaria , can be accepted into the European Union in 2007 .
. Mr President , it has been a pleasure to work with Mr Moscovici on this fine report .
indeed I enjoyed and valued his work in his earlier capacity as a minister . it is just as much of a pleasure to work with him as a rapporteur .
I thank Mr Moscovici for this fine work .
I believe that President Iliescu - as he retires from his second and final term of office - and his government , as well as Prime Minister Nastase , have concluded their work on a high note .
they should be proud of their successful achievement of the enlargement process for Romania .
it is easy today to damn Romania with faint praise , to say that she has done well but has a huge amount more to do .
that may indeed be true , but let us recall the low position from which she has come and has advanced so rapidly .
none of us would have dreamed five years ago , when the Helsinki Council declared Romania to be one of the &apos; regatta principle &apos; countries , that she could have completed the chapters so rapidly and indeed so well .
all the chapters are closed .
of course , implementation must be high on the agenda of the new government and it will have to have very competent people to implement this matter .
they have to apply the properly and respect the deadlines .
a great deal of capacity @-@ building has to happen .
administrative capacity is vital in applying the as well as ongoing training of staff .
however , let us remember what an enormous amount has been achieved .
one of the ways in which we could help is by trying to stop the brain drain .
Romania needs its young people very badly .
we should do all we can to strengthen the position of higher education in Romania , to help the country offer jobs , training and workshops to young people .
it would be very easy , as Romania comes ever closer to the Union , for us to be a magnet for her young people to leave the country .
that would be a very great pity .
it is those young people who will assist Romania in implementing the correctly and improving the absorption capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in .
I congratulate the Commission too for the very dedicated work which colleagues and I have seen carried out over the last few years .
I have put forward one amendment , at which I would ask Mr Moscovici and other colleagues to look carefully .
they have acknowledged that I have been concentrating in particular on the issue of children .
while I understood and respected Mr Moscovici &apos;s support for Prime Minister Raffarin &apos;s request for an international commission to re @-@ examine certain sensitive cases on humanitarian grounds where there have been problems with inter @-@ country adoption , nonetheless , I wonder if colleagues might consider accepting my amendment to paragraph 17 .
Mr Moscovici &apos;s report requests an international commission .
that is one outside the European Union .
my own amendment asks the Commission to take up this matter with the Romanian Government - which is right and proper - and also to report back to the government of Romania and - since I know that colleagues are concerned about this - to the European Parliament as well .
perhaps Mr Moscovici and I could discuss this .
I am sure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let it be clear that this is not a debate between those in favour of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union and those who oppose it .
my group does not have any fundamental objections to Romania &apos;s membership either , not even on 1 January 2007 .
this is a debate , however , between those who think that , except for a few loose ends , Romania is ready , and those , myself included , who think that it is not , and see that as a reason why we cannot give the go @-@ ahead right now .
I am , in all honesty , surprised at the position of some groups .
the very same Members of this House who rightly attached great importance to human rights during the vote and discussions about Turkey , a country that is on the very threshold of negotiations , are , in the case of Romania , a country that is completing them , prepared to overlook just about anything where the same Copenhagen criteria are concerned .
there are yet other Members in this House whose view of reality has , quite honestly , been somewhat clouded by the fact that members of their parties are probably involved in reprehensible affairs , or because they hope that , after the recent elections in Romania , everything will be very different overnight .
hope for improvement is fine , but we should not be naive .
the problems in Romania are immense , so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that we cannot give them the green light .
I will give you two examples .
over the past few years , there has been no improvement in the situation of journalists and the media in Romania ; indeed , it has changed for the worse .
the number of attacks on critical journalists has increased and the criticism levelled at them was often connected to cases of corruption .
all NGOs , all the organisations that we always praise so highly - Transparency International , the Open Society Institute , the OECD - all have one message : corruption is still rife in Romania and should not be underestimated .
of course , everyone here will state that corruption is to be combated , but how seriously can we take a party which has a majority in the Romanian parliament and a member of which - also a former minister - had to step down a few years ago on account of corruption , and is now vice @-@ chairman of that same party and a candidate for the senate ?
in my view , this , together with Amnesty International &apos;s reports about the truly abominable treatment of psychiatric patients , can only lead to one conclusion , namely that Romania should wait for a little longer .
that is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separate report next spring , for example , on the aspects which everyone , including the rapporteur , worry about , namely freedom of the press , corruption , independence of the judiciary ?
the Commission does compile a report on possible problems concerning competition , but refuses to devote a fresh report to human rights problems .
why should state support be a stumbling block and human rights not ?
to those who say - and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the presidency - that we still have the suspension clause at our disposal , which enables us to delay Romania &apos;s accession by one year , I should like to state clearly that this suspension clause can only be invoked if there is a unanimous vote in favour of it .
in other words , if one country in the Council refuses to cooperate , then it will not happen .
what about qualified majority ?
regrettably , that can only be applied to a number of specific areas , and freedom of the press is not one of them .
in my view , Parliament should not relinquish its power by giving the go @-@ ahead now and , logically , doing the same thing in March .
Parliament must take itself seriously .
I would like to quote from a major Dutch newspaper : &apos; with friendliness that lacks honesty , Europe may become big , but it is growth without substance , greatness without inner strength . &quot;
the strength of the European Union is to be found in principles that apply universally , including to political allies .
. Mr President , Romania has a long tradition of authoritarian and undemocratic government , Left @-@ wing and Right @-@ wing alternately .
this tradition goes hand in hand with an intolerant attitude towards its ethnic minorities - Hungarians , Roma and Germans .
a great deal of attention is always paid to major dam projects , enormous factories and monumental buildings , but not to vagrant children menaced by glue sniffing or prostitution , or to serious environmental pollution .
in Rosia Montana , there is still the risk of a gold extraction project going ahead , which will use chemical substances capable of seriously polluting the soil and river water in the long term .
in the cities , the monumental facades hide decay , neglect and poverty .
freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary do not meet European standards .
in neighbouring Moldavia , which came under Russian rule in 1940 , there was initial support for reunification , but , as Romania has little to offer at the moment , that support has now ebbed away .
at present , many Romanians look up to America and the dollar above all , and , to a lesser extent , to Turkey , which is regarded as a major economic partner and an example of a self @-@ assured country .
at international level , Romania is currently , like Turkey , a close ally of the United States , so much so that it is hindering cooperation with the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
complaints about election fraud were lodged again recently .
I do not expect the careless interpretation of parliamentary democracy to disappear following last weekend &apos;s election of a president from the other side of the political spectrum , who is also likely to determine the composition of a new government .
this new government will probably take the view that the previous government was too meek in its negotiations with the European Union and that it had allowed itself to be humiliated .
in its previous composition , this parliament was extremely critical about the possibility of Romania fulfilling in the short term the current EU criteria in terms of democracy , human rights and the environment .
that is why it seemed certain that Romania would be joining later than Bulgaria , together with Croatia at the very earliest .
I am surprised at the recent U @-@ turn within the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rejection of a number of critical amendments .
the fear that Romania might be humiliated and the EU &apos;s ambition for speedy territorial expansion now appear more imperative than solving problems .
the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left would like to welcome Romania to the European Union as quickly as possible , provided that , as is the case with Turkey , solutions have been found to the problems in the areas of democracy , human rights and the environment , and this is still a huge obstacle at the moment .
. Mr President , as a former ship &apos;s captain , the newly @-@ elected President of Romania , Traian Basescu , knows a thing or two about choppy waters , which gives him a considerable edge , for the ship of state of his native country , where he will be taking the helm , is currently facing rough seas .
moreover , Basescu will be the first to admit this frankly . in an interview with the of 26 November , Basescu , who is at present the mayor of Bucharest , gave this explanation of why he is striving to turn his country round politically : &apos; the problem is corruption which , in this country , has been elevated to a form of government . &quot;
the report by Mr Moscovici is just as clear about Bucharest &apos;s failings as it makes its way to Brussels , and we sincerely appreciate the way in which he has done this , quite rightly tracing Romania &apos;s shortcomings in terms of all the accession criteria , including the political conditions .
in the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country , I asked for attention to be paid to violations of the freedom of the press .
unfortunately , this report mentions these violations again in Paragraph 8 .
it is as plain as day that there is physical aggression against investigative journalists , and that the government exerts pressure on financially weak media .
in his recent book &apos; Threatened journalists , beaten journalists , &quot; the author and journalist Malin Bot confirmed this depressing image .
the book is an outright indictment of the prevailing press restraint in Romania .
Mr Basescu and his political sympathisers therefore have their work cut out .
incidentally , in our regions , in Western Europe , we should take note of what Malin Bot has to say about the dubious role of Western publishers who have bought up many Romanian papers , and who , in his words , &apos; do not come to Romania to defend democracy , but simply to make money . &quot;
I hope that a new Romanian Government takes the European accession criteria entirely seriously from the word go .
in the final analysis , it is not fair to blame them for the commitments that have not been complied with by the Nastase government .
this list is long and weighty .
moreover , time goes on ; it is fortunate , with the desired accession date of 1 January 2007 in mind , that the incoming President Basescu realises this all too well .
that is why he deserves all our attention and support in this undoubtedly difficult period .
this House expects the Commission to strictly enforce the security mechanism agreed upon with Bucharest .
to finish off , I should like to draw Bucharest &apos;s attention to one paragraph in the Moscovici report : &apos; calls on it to speed up the restitution of property and adopt legislation on the restitution of churches . &quot;
at the same time , I would ask the Council and Commission to closely monitor the implementation of this long drawn @-@ out issue .
the Dutch Presidency has already made a pledge to that effect to its own parliament .
in a fine review in a German quality newspaper yesterday , I read a razor @-@ sharp satire on the political degeneration of Romania under post @-@ Communist rule .
the author aptly parodied the title of Prime Minister Nastase &apos;s campaign document entitled : &apos; from Karl Marx to Coca @-@ Cola , &quot; claiming that a document entitled &apos; From Karl Marx to Al Capone &quot; would be just as truthful .
we very much hope that Romania , under President Basescu , will break this persistent political spell .
the surprising outcome of the second round of the presidential elections appears to be an encouraging sign of this .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the New Italian Socialist Party wishes the incoming President Basescu all the best in his work .
the countless young Romanians who have supported him over recent months and are jubilantly filling the squares and streets of Bucharest and the rest of the country are , regardless of their political affiliations , pinning on him their hopes for change and for a different , new and better future .
Mr Basescu has a difficult and yet rather exciting task ahead of him : to steer his country on the new courses of modernisation , anti @-@ corruption measures and full compliance with human and civil rights , as well as the permanent adoption of democratic structures .
we hope - or rather , we are sure - that the end of that journey can only be the total integration of Romania into the political and socioeconomic bloc of the European Union .
while we note with satisfaction the goals that have been achieved , our task over the remaining two years will be to ensure that concrete , real and significant improvements are made in the many areas that still fall short of European standards .
I refer in particular to the qualitative leap that is urgently needed in the field of human rights , especially with regard to the requests of the Roma minority , which often suffers discrimination with the acquiescence of government authorities .
the Roma make up 2.5 million citizens who live on the edges of society in totally unacceptable conditions .
I also refer to the requests and aspirations of the Hungarian minority , which consists of 1.5 million people ; the treatment of the disabled ; the shameful condition of the health infrastructure , especially those facilities housing patients with mental problems ; the violent methods and actual physical abuse practised by the forces of law and order ; a judicial system that fails to meet the criteria of efficiency and independence ; as well as media that are still not entirely free .
on visiting the country , I was struck and disturbed by the many - too many - children wandering the streets alone .
we must demand a concrete commitment from the government on this issue .
it is a legal and moral obligation , not an option .
everything possible has to be done , then , to ensure that every child in Romania , as in Europe and the rest of the world , has the right to a peaceful , happy childhood and the right to smile with hope for the future .
Mr President , I have been a Romania @-@ watcher for five years now , ever since I took up the case of a London constituent of mine , Prince Carol Mircea .
he demonstrated clearly to me that the Romanian Government , through its Prosecutor General , had repeatedly intervened on one side - allegedly under instructions from President Iliescu - of the civil case against Carol &apos;s half brother , ex @-@ King Michael of Romania .
I was therefore particularly delighted at seeing the independence of the Romanian justice system .
not only has Romania now abolished the Soviet @-@ era right for the state to intervene in civil cases , but recently , when the previous government tried to circumvent the royal palace &apos;s property claim dispute by a bill of compensation in the Parliament , the Senate threw it out , citing the fact that it was before the Supreme Court .
so , things are improving in terms of the independence of Romania &apos;s justice system .
clearly , Mr Basescu &apos;s victory in the presidential elections shows that Romania is also moving rapidly forward in reform terms .
the surprise result definitely scotched all the allegations that the election would be stolen by cheating by the authorities .
Romania is far from perfect and the fight against corruption and organised crime will be priority number one for the new government .
more work needs to be done on minority rights , including the large Roma population and the Hungarian population .
also let me make a plea against a rigid imposition of the moratorium against foreign child adoptions , as many families from countries as diverse as Italy and Israel have developed bonds with children in orphanages .
it would be cruel and inhumane to terminate the process arbitrarily at this late stage .
I welcome the Romanian Government &apos;s decision to establish an international committee to resolve this delicate issue .
as Vice @-@ President of the Ukraine Delegation , I believe that outstanding disputes such as the issue of territorial claims by Romania over tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea , which is currently under Ukrainian control , need to be resolved before 2007 .
here , the ownership of the exclusive economic interest zone is essential , as oil is believed to be present .
good relations with Ukraine , which is now establishing itself as a fully @-@ fledged European democracy , are important for the future .
another issue is the border area of the Danube Delta , where there are concerns that a Ukrainian @-@ built navigable channel is upsetting the surrounding wetlands and hence also the unique local habitat for rare bird species .
more distant is the whole issue of cooperating with and stabilising Moldova and the Transnistria question that goes with it .
interestingly , if Mr Yuschenko comes to power in Kiev on 26 December , the days for the Tiraspol regime of Transnistria are numbered , hence the Russians &apos; desire to deny Mr Yuschenko victory .
has anybody investigated whether the Tiraspol regime may also have had a role to play in the poisoning of Mr Yuschenko ?
I believe Romania will be ready to join the European Union by 1 January 2007 with Bulgaria .
I welcome both as EU Member States , although I do not see the two as chronologically coupled automatically .
lastly , of course , there are the safeguard clauses which allow date slippage if Romania falls short of its requirements under the ; but nevertheless I fully support the Moscovici report and look forward to Romania joining us in the 25 Member States by 2007 .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mr Moscovici on his very objective and well @-@ balanced report .
I fully agree with Mr Rehn and Mr Nicolaï , who I feel have expressed very objective opinions .
Romania &apos;s accession is beneficial to Hungary for two reasons ; on the one hand , good neighbourliness , and on the other , the issue of the minority Hungarian community , with more than half a million Hungarians living in Romania .
that is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Romania to accede in two years &quot; time .
ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the Nastase Government , which has done a great deal to bring about the historic reconciliation between Romania and Hungary .
today we have a strategic partnership .
it is true that in all honesty much remains to be done , but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years .
I should like to stress three key issues that need to be resolved .
the first is genuine decentralisation , and a real devolvement of power to the regions .
the next is the protection of the environment , as clean rivers are a cross @-@ border issue .
finally , there is the question of the minorities , the Roma and the Hungarians .
I do not wish to make the implementation of different forms of autonomy a prerequisite to Romania &apos;s accession , but it would be helpful to open negotiations with the new government , namely tripartite negotiations between the Romanian Government , the Hungarian parliamentary party and the Hungarian Government , as was done in the case of South Tyrol and the Åland Islands in Finland .
the European Union offers helpful precedents here .
it would therefore be desirable to start the negotiations , and I fully support Romania &apos;s accession without delay .
it is perhaps Romania that has the worst legacy of all the former communist countries .
Ceaucescu and his associates destroyed the country , ruined its economy , fragmented its society and intimidated its citizens .
the last fifteen years are far from being a success story as the postponement of reforms wasted several valuable years .
I therefore hope that the newly @-@ elected leaders , President and Government of Romania will set about facing the challenges before them with redoubled effort .
there are two tasks that I especially would like to mention .
the first one , where there are considerable deficiencies , is the social integration of the Romanian Romany minority comprising of over two million people , who are in a very difficult situation .
the second one is giving a higher priority to environmental issues , since the state of the environment in Romania is far behind that of the other candidate countries .
regulations not only have to be adopted , but they have to be implemented as well .
let me remind you of the very dangerous mining project of Rosia Montana , threatening us with severe environmental disaster .
the road that leads to the completion of negotiations is long and rugged , and I congratulate Romania &apos;s leadership on their success .
from now on it should focus on adopting the .
I hope Romania will fulfil the obligations and will become a member state in 2007 .
this is in our interest and in Romania &apos;s interest .
I therefore think that Mr Basescu &apos;s demand that two chapters should be reopened for negotiations is highly risky .
it jeopardises Romania &apos;s accession in 2007 , and delay is not in the interest of either Romania , or the European Union .
Romania has made great sacrifices in order to be able to work towards becoming a member of the Union .
I firmly believe that it is in our best interest that Romania joins as soon as 2007 , and Romania must realise that several obligations simply must be fulfilled on the way .
this is why I find this topic so crucial and ask the Commissioner and the Commission to continuously monitor Romania &apos;s progress in this matter , as it is not only in our best interest but also in the interest of Romanian citizens .
Mr President , in the environmental sphere , Romania at present lags very far behind in terms of what is required by EU legislation .
in spite of the fact that it has been given very long transitional periods where important environmental regulations are concerned , it has not implemented different legislation .
where , in a number of areas , such legislation has in actual fact been enacted , it has been so on paper but not in practice .
last year , we sent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety to the Department of the Environment in Bucharest .
the delegation examined quite a few of the more controversial projects , and our view was confirmed : the pace of reform in the environmental sphere needs urgently to be stepped up .
there is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular eye on over the next few years .
it concerns Rosia Montana , a proposal to construct Europe &apos;s largest gold mine in Romania .
it is a project that will have huge environmental repercussions .
among other things , large quantities of cyanide will be used in this sensitive area .
the issue is that of whether Romania will comply with current EU legislation , for example the provisions governing environmental impact assessments and the water directive .
the issue is also that of whether Romania will successfully comply with the forthcoming new directive on waste from mines and its environmental repercussions .
I should like to call upon the Commission to examine the Rosia Montana project particularly carefully to see if there really is successful compliance with the EU &apos;s environmental requirements , which I consider to be minimum standards and ones with which compliance is also being demanded by the local population in the area .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I join in with the many positive comments made to the rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , regarding the balance of his report .
while not ignoring any of the critical areas in the process of Romania &apos;s preparation to join the European Union , the report shows a clear appreciation of the notable efforts made and the results - albeit still partial - achieved by Romania in that process .
this morning , with great aplomb , this Parliament gave the green light to the procedure for Turkey &apos;s preparation to join the European Union .
I am in favour of Romania &apos;s accession for exactly the same reasons that have led me to express my strong hostility to Turkey &apos;s entry .
Romania is Europe ; Romania has a civil and political society based on values which , despite their undeniable highs and lows , have to be regarded as perfectly comparable to the values on which the European Union is based .
certain areas in which basic measures are still needed certainly deserve encouragement and support .
they include the multiannual anti @-@ crime strategy , the state aid issue ( a subject particularly close to the hearts of us liberalists ) , the sensitive question of the return of property and churches , as well as the modernisation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a society such as Europe &apos;s , which is characterised by systems that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state .
I have just listened to the speech by a spokesman for a political party that voted for the accession of Turkey , who repeated the harsh remarks made by NGOs about respect for human rights in Romania .
I should like to have heard the same observations made about Turkey as well : in that case they would have been decidedly more justified .
it is , however , absolutely necessary to call the Romanian authorities &quot; attention to the urgent question of illegal immigration .
one Member has referred to the children , who understandably had an emotional effect on him during a visit to Romania .
I do not need to go to Romania , because you just need to drive around the streets of Turin , Milan , Genoa and Rome to see Romanian children exploited by criminal organisations .
we have to put a stop to illegal immigration , and Romania has to defend its external borders and actively collaborate in stamping out this activity , which does no credit to the civilisation of Eugen Ionescu , Mircea Eliade and the many other great writers and thinkers of a civilisation that we feel is close to us and which we share .
Romania &apos;s citizens have a place in the European Union , there is no question about it .
one of the reasons why we mutually need each other is because through accession , the underlying principles of the Union , decentralisation and local self @-@ government may help improve prospects for the future of the Hungarian minority there , including one and a half million people .
the question is about fulfilling commitments : will Romania be able to adopt the that all Member States are obliged to fulfil ?
the Union seems to be more lenient towards Romania than it was towards those countries that joined in May .
Mr Moscovici &apos;s report critically examines how Romania has met the criteria so far .
I would like to compliment him on his skill at compromise , as he included several of my proposed amendments into his report , making his arguments firmer .
the report examines areas of severe deficit : the independence of judicial proceedings , the discriminatory legislation on election rights and the return of ecclesiastical goods .
let me take this even a step further and point out some of Romania &apos;s deficiencies in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria , highlighted by the election @-@ related abuse on November 28 .
as a Hungarian delegate , I feel obligated to list the temporary exemptions in the field of environmental protection that Romania asked for .
Hungarians are apprehensive about these exemptions , as they would have a direct effect on the quality of water in Hungary and thus have requested that the Hungarian Government reopened chapters of environmental protection , which have just recently been closed .
it is exactly because of the uncertainties of such commitments that I would like to emphasise how important it is to monitor strictly the period between signing the accession treaty and the actual time of accession .
if necessary , the processes of the two candidate countries should be separated and they should receive individual performance @-@ based evaluation .
regular progress checks are very important , and Parliament must also take part in this process , so that by the time Romania joins the Union , we can feel reassured and confident as to their preparedness .
I belong to those who most sincerely hope that our doubts will be scattered by Romania &apos;s positive performance in the near future .
Mr President , in my view , last Sunday &apos;s presidential elections have indeed demonstrated that democracy in Romania is very vibrant and is also working well .
this has not always been the case , and so we have every reason to be gratified .
let us hope that the dynamic forces which have now been released will genuinely be channelled into driving forward the reforms and that the political process in Bucharest will not be obstructed .
all we can do is hope .
I was a member of the Delegation to the EU @-@ Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee from 1999 to 2004 .
if we compare 1999 and today , the country has obviously made substantial progress .
notwithstanding all the criticism in specific areas , it must be said that the previous government under Anastase achieved a great deal for Romania .
major progress has genuinely been made in many areas .
however , we cannot ignore the fact that the Romanians still have a lot to do .
not enough has been done to achieve the standards that apply throughout the European Union .
I can only repeat what many of my fellow Members have said : an independent judiciary - which means a judiciary which is independent of the executive and individual political forces - is in fact a prerequisite for Romania &apos;s cooperation within the EU .
there is still some ground to be made up here .
I also hope that corruption can be combated more effectively .
corruption is robbery at the expense of Romania &apos;s citizens , and the new President has pledged major anti @-@ corruption measures which will hopefully target not only the &apos; small fry &apos; but also the big fish .
corruption must be tackled irrespective of position or status , for it is theft from the Romanian people .
in my view , it would be quite wrong for Romania or the EU to create new obstacles at this point in time .
the negotiations should be concluded , and I would like to thank Mr Moscovici , the rapporteur , for presenting such an excellent report .
2007 must be the date when we welcome Romania into the European family , and thus integrate it into European standards as well .
Mr President , let me be clear .
I am very much in favour of Romania acceding , but all in good time and preferably in accordance with the agreements made .
in order to complete the negotiations , it simply needs to fulfil the prescribed conditions and criteria , so it is quite beyond me why the Commission should , with a straight face , claim that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria , while at the same time it reports extensively on the influence the executive power exerts over the outcome of court cases and confirms that corruption is still rife and discrimination - including that against the Roma - is still very much on the agenda .
it appears that this House &apos;s rapporteur , too , does not have any problem with stating in the first paragraph of his report that Romania meets the political criteria , while going on , later on in the report - and rightly so - to express his concern about a few crucial points .
the rapporteur goes on to draw the conclusion - which I regard as improbable - that a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations before the end of 2004 is both desirable and feasible .
my common sense leads me to a completely different conclusion , namely that Romania has not gone that far yet and , consequently , negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily before the end of 2004 .
we have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose .
our Amendments Nos 6 and 25 are also important ; Amendment No 6 underlines that the progress of all candidate countries is dependent on the assessment of their own merits and that it is for this reason that the use of individual accession agreements as a basis for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is recommended .
amendment No 25 does the necessary job of bringing paragraph 1 of the report back into line with reality .
I sincerely hope that we can count on your support so that we can get through to the European Council before it is too late , because it has just been confirmed again that the Council has now completed the formal negotiations with Romania .
it follows that this debate and tomorrow &apos;s vote are staged performances , but , before the accession agreement is signed in the spring of 2005 , Parliament must give its express approval , and I do not see that as being by any means a .
I would see it as a good thing if this House were to speak out clearly about the premature and artificial closure of the negotiations with Romania , if it were to be able to put a stop to the considerable arbitrariness in the enlargement process and if it were to keep to the agreements made .
the working method that we now see in the process with Romania will , sooner or later , result in the erosion of our community based on the rule of law and in the weakening of the Union .
Mr President , the June List will welcome Romania and Bulgaria as Members of the European Union , just as we shall welcome Turkey , the countries of the Western Balkans and , in time , Ukraine and , hopefully , Belarus .
at the same time , we wish to warn of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term - poor and economically undeveloped countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving corruption .
the EU is constructed for economically developed countries with stable democracies and only moderate problems with corruption .
the enlargement involving ten countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List was a sincere supporter is , already for its part , causing problems .
accepting poor countries such as Romania into an EU that continues to operate an absurd agricultural policy and a poorly managed structural policy and that is itself wrestling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project .
it might also prove dangerous for Romania .
there would be a significant risk of a brain drain .
entering the EU &apos;s agricultural system and being locked tightly into an economic structure without a future would also be a big disadvantage .
the election that has just taken place was , however , a big success for democracy in Romania , but both Romania and the EU countries have reasons to wait and see and not to push for premature accession .
it may be in the interests of both parties not to rush into full membership .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , for giving us a balanced report , which points out the advances made by Romania in recent years .
Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne did well to recall the position from which Romania started and the reasons that have made progress so difficult for that country .
even so , Mr Moscovici has also pointed out the limitations and shortcomings that characterise Romania &apos;s situation today .
some Members from countries that joined the European Union on 1 May this year have called for greater severity .
I should like them to reread what was said in this Chamber before their countries joined , when we were looking at how far they had progressed on their path towards joining the Union .
in all likelihood they still had considerable shortcomings at that stage but , even so , it was thought appropriate that they should be allowed to join at the agreed time .
in the case of Romania , we also have a safeguard clause , which was not provided in the other cases .
I therefore believe it is only fair to give that country the chance to do its utmost over the next two years so that it can be ready when the time comes to actually join our Union .
there is no doubt that there are topics about which our fellow citizens are concerned , the most important of which is the inadequacy of the fight against organised crime .
if we were to ask people in the streets of our countries to say how afraid they often felt of criminal gangs , we would surely be inclined to encourage the Romanian Government to do more in that direction .
as Mr Leinen rightly recalled , the fight against corruption is widespread in the countries joining our Union .
I should also like to touch on the topic of children .
this is a subject that I have addressed extensively in recent years , together with Baroness Nicholson .
child protection issues need to be placed at the heart of our thinking .
I believe , however , that the proposal put forward by the rapporteur of having an international commission is a good solution .
if we want to prevent those children from spending their adolescence and youth on the streets of our cities or shut up in institutions , we have to take into account the dozens of families that have already made contact with them and would love to be able to give them affection .
let us therefore welcome Mr Moscovici &apos;s suggestion to that effect .
lastly , Mr President , we need to consider the importance of stability .
we shall see whether the outcome of the recent elections in Bucharest will lead to political stability .
I believe that that is what we all wish for , because only with stability can there be any hope of seeing Romania ready to meet its commitments .
ladies and gentlemen , I started my career as a teacher of modern languages , and when I was marking exams or homework I realised that I would become increasingly harsh as I went on , and that I would be much tougher on the last papers than I had been on the first - to such a point that I would take another look at the first ones to make sure that I had been sufficiently fair .
listening to this debate and hearing what some Members have to say , and also recalling this morning &apos;s debate , I wonder whether we are not experiencing something similar here , because it seems to me that we are becoming increasingly harsh with each enlargement .
is this to say that there are no problems ?
of course not .
I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they lie , and said that considerable improvements are essential .
ladies and gentlemen , I am fairly well acquainted with Romania and have had the opportunity on several occasions to urge those in positions of authority from all political sides to speed up work on implementing the reforms and transposing the necessary legislation and regulation .
like the majority of the members of my group , I will be voting in favour of the recommendations in the Moscovici report .
I will be doing so not only because of my feelings for Romania , where I have many excellent friends , but also because , having visited the country as long ago as February 1990 and seen fresh evidence of the violence of the end of the previous year , I can fully appreciate how far it has already come .
we owe our friends understanding and friendship , but not weak or almost indifferent indulgence .
this has always been my attitude towards Romania , and it remains my attitude today .
my positive attitude remains fundamentally an attitude of vigilant friendship .
I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that more honesty is called for .
I am most grateful to Mr Lagendijk for his demand in this respect , even though we have arrived at different conclusions for Turkey .
he is absolutely right : we must demand honesty in relation to Romania as well .
in my view , this obviously means that we must dispense with a few of our dogmas .
the first is that deadlines which have been mooted at some point in the past are now regarded as more sacred than the progress made or the realities of the situation .
let me be blunt . we will not do ourselves any favours if we abide by 1 January 2007 as a date for Romania &apos;s accession .
secondly - and Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I am directing these remarks specifically to you , as we had the pleasure of discussing the budget , among other things , with you - we are talking about a period for which we still have no budget , as we have yet to adopt a new Financial Perspective to cover the period from 1 January 2007 .
if you cling to your second dogma , namely the figure of 1 % , we will be unable to cope with this financial burden .
we cannot argue that Europe is continually expanding and its agenda is becoming longer , while money is becoming increasingly tight .
please be honest and make it clear that there is no funding .
we need to negotiate the Financial Perspective first , and then we will see whether everything adds up .
thirdly - and again , let me be blunt - I have heard every speaker talk about the problems which we still have to overcome , not us , that is , but Romania , namely corruption , democracy and the rule of law .
just what do we mean when we talk about membership of the European Union ?
is this not the precondition , as we learned today at noon ?
according to the majority of Members of this House , this is not the precondition for the opening of negotiations .
I take a different view .
ultimately , however , before we are handed an accession treaty - and we have been told that this will be available within the next six months - everything has to be in place .
we are deceiving ourselves if we proceed on the basis that monitoring processes and clauses which are built in but will never come into force because they require unanimity in the Council are enough to justify our confidence and convince us that everything will work out just fine .
that is why I am appealing to you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , in relation to the drafting of the presidency conclusions on Friday .
I realise that you have a problem in that you have little to show for your presidency .
however , no one is reproaching you : during the six months in which you held the presidency , Europe was operating below par .
we had the European elections , and then it took some time for the Commission to be appointed and confirmed in office .
no one can blame the presidency for this .
however , you are responsible for ensuring that we do not deceive ourselves every six months .
that means that we should not claim , in Council documents , that significant progress has been made and improvements have yet again been achieved when this is not the case .
I therefore appeal to you to be honest when you draw up the presidency conclusions on Friday .
I appeal to the House as well : let us take an honest vote on this issue tomorrow .
Mr President , we like to talk about a Europe of values .
how does this fit with the decision to admit Romania to the European Union in just two years time unless by some chance there should be a deferral of just 12 months , which hardly seems likely given that we have heard today that the Council has overridden the Commission &apos;s concerns in closing chapters , a deplorable example of over principle of which the Dutch presidency should be ashamed .
one of my colleagues said that we are being too severe on Romania .
how soft does she want us to be ?
on the Commission &apos;s own admission , Romania suffers from serious and widespread corruption ; it has a judiciary which is neither efficient nor independent ; it does not possess genuine media freedom ; it cannot implement the at local and regional level ; it fails to prevent money laundering ; it permits the ill @-@ treatment of prisoners in custody ; it fails to enforce laws against child and sexual trafficking .
yet this is a country apparently now so close to meeting EU values that we are putting it on a certain course to accession .
it is not surprising that the EU may stand accused of being unable to say &apos; no &apos; to anyone when it sets its sights so low .
the Commissioner says , and I quote from his recent parliamentary answer : &apos; it seems likely that Romania &apos;s future progress will be accelerated by its accession to the EU &apos; .
however , neither he nor any of us know whether that will prove true .
so far we have been lucky : membership of the European Union has tended to make bad apples wholesome but perhaps we will reach the point where the bad apples infect the rest .
you only have to look at Lithuania , near the top of the world league for corruption , or to the United Kingdom , locking up people without charge or trial , to realise that Europe can very easily allow its values to be betrayed from within .
we do not have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with existing Member States that quietly reject the principles of good governance .
perhaps the Commissioner can take a lead in building such a mechanism .
I wish the new Romanian Government well .
the results of last Sunday &apos;s election give hope for reform , although the result was no thanks either to the Commission or the Council , both of which played right into the hands of the former cynical government .
Romania &apos;s problems run deep .
once applicants are allowed through the EU door , the Commission is deprived of its best weapons to secure change .
instead of using the opportunity to apply maximum pressure to gain reform , we seem determined to set it on a conveyor belt to automatic accession .
Romania should join the European Union , but it should do when it meets the values of the EU .
it would be a grave mistake to set a date for accession now .
- Mr President , maybe Bulgaria and Romania are being wronged by our debating Turkey &apos;s accession prospects over the last few days in the European Parliament - and shall also be doing so in the European Union , at the European Council , in a few days &apos; time .
I believe that forecasts on the subject of Turkey are overshadowing both the expression and the weighting of our political word .
I should like to start by referring to a topical matter , the finalisation yesterday of the results of the elections in Romania .
the new President has been named and the results of the election have been accepted by his fellow candidate , putting an end to any disputes relating to the electoral process .
nonetheless , the new President will have to achieve the strong backing of parliament if he is to honour immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union .
given the almost balanced presence of the main political forces in the Romanian parliament , cooperation amongst everyone and serious joint efforts will be needed for the successful continuation of European integration .
ladies and gentlemen , by my reading , Romania has made significant progress , especially in such a short space of time , in coming into line with political and economic accession criteria .
nonetheless , we should not overlook the need for further radical reform , focusing on the efficient combating of corruption and changes in the public administration and in the judicial system , in the aim of securing truly independent justice .
in addition , further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls , asylum and immigration policy and more drastic action to combat organised crime and corruption .
at economic level , it is considered necessary , , to safeguard macro @-@ economic stability , rationalise the role of the state in the economy and introduce efficient regional and rural development policies and policies for greater regional integration and cooperation with the countries of south @-@ eastern Europe .
my personal appraisal is that , with the support of the European Commission and with the precondition , of course , of more intense effort , it is feasible that Romania will be able to comply more fully with the criteria and the values and principles of the Union and sign an accession agreement at the same time as Bulgaria .
Mr President , firstly I wish to thank my colleague , Mr Moscovici , for an excellent report , and one that takes account of different points of view .
candidate countries must be treated equally and fairly .
Romania must fulfil the conditions imposed on it , just as the others did when they acceded to the Union .
we are not striving for perfection here : none of the present Member States of the Union is perfect .
problems have been mentioned here today relating to Romania &apos;s home affairs and issues of justice .
Mr Basescu , winner of the Romanian presidential elections , promised the Romanians in his victory speech an unsullied administration and an independent civil service .
this promise must be taken seriously and must be fulfilled .
we have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms .
I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting human rights in the future .
attention should not just be paid to the viability of public administration : human rights issues are at least as important , if not more so .
trafficking in human beings is something for which there must be zero tolerance , both in Romania and elsewhere in Europe .
unfortunately , even the credibility of the present Member States suffers on this issue .
we cannot establish a margin of tolerance for trafficking in human beings : it has to be completely prohibited .
Romania also needs support in its implementation of the new law on child protection .
finally , I wish to express my thanks to Commissioner Rehn , as he has promised to keep Parliament very well informed .
in my opinion , that is a very important point .
Romania should be ready for membership , but the current Member States should also be ready to accept Romania as a member , and dialogue between the Commission and Parliament can only further that endeavour .
- Mr President , the Romanian people have just voted a different political party into power for the second time since the revolution .
does this not prove that democracy is working in this country , which has suffered under both dictatorship and communism ?
that is why Romania cannot be compared to other countries , because the after @-@ effects of this twofold oppression are still being felt .
it will take several more generations before the insane decisions of a dictator and a secret police , the , cease to affect how people behave .
our report does not mention the issue of the , which nevertheless presents a significant problem in terms of human resources .
in fact , Romania has not yet emerged from this difficult period .
Mr President , have we considered that the young people who were born after the dictatorship have not yet reached the age of majority ?
where is this nation to find untainted , independent staff , who have not been close to the dictator , who have not belonged to the communist or been part of the to fill posts in these administrations and thus ensure that they are independent , which is what we require ?
the progress made towards accession to the European Union should be considered from two different viewpoints : the desire of the political classes for change and the ability to achieve it in practice .
the proposal to delay Romania &apos;s accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficulty , and I actually find it extremely arrogant .
it is only 15 years since the revolution in Romania , which could just as easily have led to a civil war .
we must therefore hope that President Basescu succeeds in forming a coalition that has the national interest at heart , rather than the profile of the different political parties .
although President Iliescu and President Constantinescu , a one @-@ time member of this European People &apos;s Party , have not managed to put in place all of the necessary reforms , we must nevertheless acknowledge that they have brought relative institutional stability to the country .
let us then , rather than playing the schoolmaster , have some respect for the efforts already made and accurately assess what remains to be done .
Mr President , 2007 will in any case be a great year for Romania because in 2007 a Romanian city , Sibiu , will share the title of European Capital of Culture with Luxembourg .
this proposal was made by the Luxembourg Government , and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Ministers and the Commission .
the rich multicultural and multiethnic Romanian heritage will certainly enrich the culture of Europe , and Romania should also be seen from the point of view of its cultural riches and the potential of its population , which has been badly bruised by the madness of a dictator and the damaging effects of a totalitarian ideology .
Mr President , this morning I voted in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey .
I am also in favour of Romania &apos;s accession , and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality .
I believe that our rapporteur has drawn the right conclusions in his report , and I am grateful to him .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank Mr Moscovici for his excellent report .
with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria , the fifth round of enlargement will have been implemented , creating a larger , democratic Europe , which will take its place on the world political stage as a place of great promise and profound concerns , distinguished by being the Europe of citizenship .
Europe is thus not just a free @-@ market and free trade area with a single currency , but above all it has the ability and desire to peacefully export the model consisting of the rule of law , protection of minorities and human rights , sustainable development , as well as an economy and finances that are efficient and designed to promote cohesion .
that is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Treaty and the Nice Charter affirm .
we therefore welcome the successes and steady improvement that Romania has achieved in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the various fields , as Mr Moscovici has indicated , emphasising , , its respect for its minorities , both Hungarian and Roma .
Romania must , however , make rapid progress to fulfil all the accession commitments , especially in the area of the Community .
structural measures are not enough to combat poverty .
corruption also needs to be fought through preventive measures and all laws need to be enforced .
lastly , we feel that the improvement of legislation on child protection and international adoptions is a positive step .
regarding the latter area , I would call on the Romanian authorities to find an immediate solution to the problem of adoptions hit by delays , which are depriving children of the families to which they are entitled .
in the name of that universal right , which is one of the strong points of the Constitutional Treaty , and in addition to the creation of an international commission to start work straight away , I call on the newly @-@ elected Romanian authorities not to waste precious time and , for Christmas , to give those children the parents that already love them and with whom they can build a better future in a peaceful Europe .
.
Mr President , I will be brief .
I have heard many positive remarks , most of which I agree with .
of course , there were also many concerns expressed , many of which I also agree with .
there were some critical remarks , with which I do not agree , from Mr Ferber , Mr Lagendijk and others , that Romania is not ready to close the negotiations .
I emphasise that we , as a presidency and as a Council , base our position on the assessment of the European Commission .
Romania is not ready for accession , which is why we feel it is important to have two more years to achieve the whole framework for the negotiations , as we discussed before , with extra guarantees and extra safeguards .
in response to Mr Lagendijk &apos;s remarks , we do not need unanimity in the Council for using this extra safeguard clause - the possibility of postponing the accession for a maximum of a year .
no , precisely in the area of justice and home affairs which he mentions - as many members did - and also in the sensitive area of competition , we only need a qualified majority for using the extra safeguard clause .
the rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , Mr Meijer and others made some remarks about signals from Romania that the president @-@ elect wants to renegotiate the results .
the president @-@ elect seems to have noticed critical remarks about the idea of reopening some chapters .
we learned from Bucharest that Mr Basescu is emphasising the efforts to be made before January 2007 , which leave no room for reopening the final results of the negotiations .
in a short reply to Mr Ferber about the financial consequences of accession , I repeat what I said about Bulgaria .
the financial consequences are already arranged in the financial package for 2007 @-@ 2009 , irrespective of the new financial perspective .
let me conclude with my compliments to Mr Moscovici .
his report addresses all the important areas in a constructive and even @-@ handed way .
.
Mr President , I wish to join the President @-@ in @-@ office of the Council in thanking Mr Moscovici , and I would like to make one or two comments and reply to those questions that have been raised in this debate .
firstly , Mr Tabajdi said he appreciated the Commission &apos;s objectivity and impartiality .
I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in future this should be a guiding principle in all enlargement policy .
my view is that after last year &apos;s major setback we shall now be proceeding gradually and steadily in terms of the enlargement of the European area of peace and democracy .
our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradual , steady , careful and thorough .
in this regard , I understand in general the views expressed by Mr Ferber .
it is a pity he did not have time to hear my reply .
as Mr Ferber demanded honesty of the EU , that is to say ourselves , I agree that we should assess the effects of all decisions taken on enlargement and that we need to adhere to the criteria .
it is for that very reason that we have proposed a safeguard clause in the chapters relating to justice and home affairs and competition .
this safeguard clause may be adopted by qualified majority , which makes it credible , and it will encourage Romania to work and strive to achieve results .
several speakers have also quite rightly given attention to the challenges that lie ahead for Romania , including improving the environment and the status of minorities as well as promoting the fight against corruption and crime .
these are areas we continually monitor and will return to in detail when the Monitoring Report comes out next autumn .
it is then that we shall evaluate the progress that has been made over the months to come .
Romania &apos;s new government will have a golden opportunity to demonstrate that it can genuinely fulfil its commitments and reform the country &apos;s society and institutions .
Mr Davies and Mrs Jäätteenmäki pointed out that the current Member States also have much to do to develop the rule of law .
one can only agree with this .
these issues , however , do not fall within the competence of the Commissioner for Enlargement . rather , it would be better to address these problems via the infringement procedure or present a case using the machinery of the European Court of Human Rights .
in conclusion , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Moscovici . I agree with the view expressed by both him and Mr Szent @-@ Ivány that it is in the interests of both the European Union and Romania that Romania is ready by 2007 .
this in the first instance depends on Romania &apos;s willingness and ability to reform the country and its society .
the Commission , for its part , will give all the support it can to ensure that Romania strengthens its efforts so as to pre @-@ empt the use of the safeguard clauses referred to just now .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow .
the next item is questions to the Council ( B6 @-@ 0136 / 2004 ) .
we shall consider a number of questions .
I should first like to clarify the following : according to our Rules of Procedure , when a Member who is scheduled to ask a question cannot be here , he or she must personally request a replacement to speak on his or her behalf .
accordingly , the Bureau cannot accept replacements by third parties , such as political group secretaries @-@ general .
the requests for replacement by the Members who asked Questions Nos 4 and 7 , Mr Aylward and Mr Ryan , are therefore not accepted , and if at the time of the questions concerned those Members are not here , the questions will be deemed to have lapsed .
before you answer the first question , Mr Nicolaï , I should in any case like to remind the House what Mr Vidal @-@ Quadras told us this morning - that this sitting must finish today at 6.30 p.m. , due to commitments that the Council &apos;s representative cannot postpone .
many businesses from the new Member States which import aluminium from Russia and the CIS have appealed to their MEPs for action be taken to drop or reduce the 6 % duty , given that the economic situation in this branch of Polish industry has deteriorated significantly as a result , with higher production costs and higher product prices , leading to a fall in the competitiveness of Polish companies in the harsh environment of the European market .
the option of buying duty @-@ free aluminium from countries which have appropriate agreements with the European Union is unprofitable for small and medium @-@ sized companies .
will the Council take urgent action to protect Polish businesses threatened with closure ?
the Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer it gave to question H @-@ 0399 / 04 , by Ryszard Czarnecki , during Question Time on 17 November 2004 , in which it suggested that the honourable Member should put his question to the Commission .
- Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , I should like to inform you that I put my question to the European Commission , but regrettably I did not receive a satisfactory answer .
with your permission , I should like to make known my dissatisfaction at the alarming muddle that exists with regard to this issue , as well as the bureaucratic hurdles , which may well be intentional .
it is no easy task to identify exactly which body is competent to take decisions regarding aluminium imports from Russia and the countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States .
Poland has repeatedly applied to the European Commission for these customs duties to be reduced , yet unfortunately its applications have been rejected without adducing any clear or material reasons .
this is why , Mr Nicolaï , I am appealing to you and asking you to take action on this issue , so as to help both Polish entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other countries .
. this issue , I repeat , is really the exclusive competence of the Commission , so I cannot answer the question .
on 29 October 2004 , the Pyrenées @-@ Mediterranean Euroregion was established , comprising Catalonia , Aragon , the Balearic Islands , Midi @-@ Pyrenées and Languedoc @-@ Roussillon , as an area of inter @-@ regional cooperation on railway infrastructure , aeronautics , logistics , innovation and research , and with the stated intention of opening its doors to new regions .
the Euroregion does not have , nor will it have , any political content whatever , since this is alien to the very concept of the new legal entity created , whose efforts are directed towards the kind of cooperation described above .
what role will the European Union acknowledge this Euroregion as having , and more specifically , what involvement will the EU give it in joining up Community policies ? what management and monitoring powers will the EU grant it with regard to Community funding already granted and to be granted to the regional promotion and development of the Pyrenées @-@ Mediterranean Euroregion ?
. the Council recalls that Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1260 / 1999 , laying down general provisions on the structural funds , sets out the Community initiatives as one of the instruments of regional policy within the framework of the structural funds .
in the current programming period of 2000 @-@ 2006 there are four Community initiatives .
one of them is Interreg .
this covers cross @-@ border transnational and interregional cooperation intended to encourage a harmonious , balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Community area .
Interreg III has three sections dealing respectively with cross @-@ border cooperation : the promotion of integrated regional development between bordering regions ; cross @-@ national cooperation , contributing to an integrated and harmonious territory across the European Union ; and interregional cooperation to improve the policies and techniques of interregional economic development .
therefore , the Pyrenees / Mediterranean Euroregion could benefit from the support of this Community initiative , subject to the procedures established by the Commission .
the Council also recalls that the Commission has proposed the creation of an instrument called &apos; European groupings of cross @-@ border cooperation &apos; .
this would be given a legal personality to overcome the obstacles hindering cross @-@ border cooperation .
this proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory bodies within the Council and also has to be considered by the European Parliament within the framework of the codecision procedure .
I would like to point out that there are more than a hundred Euroregions in Europe and that , in fact , through the impetus of INTERREG , the Community initiative which is right now going also to become an objective , they are of particular interest .
I would like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council whether he believes that Euroregions such as the Pyrenees @-@ Mediterranean are fundamental , both in terms of promoting the disappearance of the borders which represent barriers to economic and social development , and in terms of giving substance to the principle of territorial cohesion , which is now enshrined in the European Constitution , which has been signed by the 25 representatives of the Governments of the Member States , and which therefore deserves every possible support from the Union ?
Mr President , we have , on occasions , received complaints from the European regions that it is the Governments of the States that distribute the Cohesion Funds and also the regional element of the Structural Funds , and on occasions those regions of the same political colour as the Government of the State receive favourable treatment .
Mr Barnier , then Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy , announced to us an instrument which the regions could access directly without having to go through the Governments of the States .
I do not know whether the initiative on European cross @-@ border cooperation groupings , which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament , is the instrument Mr Barnier was referring to .
would the Council agree that the regions should have the possibility of accessing the funds directly without having to go through the Governments of the States ?
. I tried to be comprehensive in my initial remarks , but I will add that Member States and regional and local authorities have experienced major difficulties in carrying out managing actions of cross @-@ border cooperation , transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation within the framework of differing national laws and procedures .
that calls for appropriate measures at EU / Community level in order to reduce the difficulties .
harmonious development of the entire Community territory and reinforced economic , social and territorial cohesion imply enhanced cross @-@ border cooperation and the adoption of measures to improve the implementation conditions for cross @-@ border cooperation .
. in reply to the honourable Member the Council stresses that it has not altered its position following the US decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name .
at the first meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council between the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of September 2004 , the Council noted that the differences over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia persisted and encouraged the search for a mutually acceptable solution , within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817 / 93 and 845 / 93 , by Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
indeed , in a joint press statement of the EU @-@ Western Balkans Forum of November 2004 , the foreign ministers of both the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recalled the need for all participants to agree on finding mutually acceptable solutions and concluding agreements on outstanding issues with neighbouring countries .
- Minister , allow me to respond with a supplementary question : does the Council consider that this long @-@ outstanding issue of the name might create problems in the desirable further of this country towards the European institutions ?
what further action does the Council intend to take in order to persuade the government of the FYROM to maintain during talks in New York a more constructive stand in the negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution ?
. that is more or less another question and I have nothing to add to what I have just said .
as the author is not present , Question No 4 lapses .
could the Council indicate what efforts the European Union will make in the coming months to lobby the American Administration so that it complies fully with the political obligations of the Kyoto Protocol ?
can the Council indicate clearly what international efforts will be undertaken by the European Union to ensure that all countries in the world comply with the clear and unequivocal commitments of the Kyoto Protocol ?
if the European Union is to become more competitive , access to new technologies must be available to all communities in Europe .
the European Union is committed to implementing what is called the IDABC Programme , which is designed to promote the use of the Internet in public and government services .
this is part of the pan @-@ European eGovernment Services Initiative .
can the European Council indicate what progress has been made in implementing this programme , which is such a central component to improving the availability of information technologies in Europe ?
the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the implementation of the IDABC Programme falls within the remit of the Commission , which is assisted in this by the pan @-@ European eGovernment Services Committee .
the Council would also like to remind the honourable Member that the IDABC Programme decision will only enter into force on 1 January 2005 and thus the implementation of the programme as such has not yet started .
the Council invites the honourable Member to refer this matter to the Commission for more details regarding the preparation of the programme .
the Council is aware of two studies launched by the Commission under the IDA Programme .
one study aims to establish the needs and benefits to businesses and citizens of pan @-@ European eGovernment Services in order to reinforce a properly oriented approach to the delivery of a pan @-@ European service .
the second one aims to identify future infrastructure services needed to support the pan @-@ European eGovernment Services .
likewise , in the preparation of the IDABC Programme , the Council also acknowledges the organisation of by Commission of a conference due to take place in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2005 , which will focus on the requirements for pan @-@ European eGovernment Services for citizens and businesses and on the factors needed to implement them .
I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his response .
the reason I put the question to him was because when this was originally discussed as a programme , it came from the Council , and the Netherlands Government was one of the governments , together with the Irish Government , the Luxembourg Government and the Italian Government , which were putting it forward as a proposal that should be pushed at Commission level .
following on from what you have said and what you know that the Commission is undertaking , are there any particular initiatives that the presidency wants to see carried forward from its presidency to the Luxembourg presidency to ensure that the role of this programme is fully implemented ?
. apart from these major actions , the IDA Unit is preparing to launch the programme fully during the first half of 2005 .
to that end , anticipated activities are being analysed and formats for work programme entries , project implementation plans , etc. are being developed .
can the European Council indicate what measures have been taken to improve maritime safety and security in Europe since the Erika disaster , and can it clearly indicate what measures it is seeking to implement so as to improve maritime safety and security in the next few years ?
. as the Council has repeatedly said , safety and security lie at the heart of the European Union maritime policy .
measures to improve them , as well as to protect the marine environment , represent the bulk of legislation adopted in this area in the five years since the disaster .
in its response to this and other similar incidents , the Council has consistently supported a dual approach : on the one hand , incorporating the provisions of international conventions into Community law and thus ensuring stricter compliance with the highest global standards and , on the other hand , adopting specific Community provisions wherever IMO standards are lacking or insufficient .
in this way a comprehensive body of maritime safety legislation has been built up and is continuing to expand .
amongst the specific measures adopted in the intermediate aftermath of the disaster , were firstly those under the Erika I package aimed at enhanced port state control to combat substandard shipping ; stricter monitoring of the classification companies use to conduct safety checks on ships ; and the accelerated phasing @-@ out of single @-@ hull oil tankers .
secondly , there were those under the Erika II package aimed at the establishment of a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency whose main role is to monitor the effectiveness of the EU maritime safety rules in general .
other measures include those designed to improve the safety of ships other than oil tankers , such as passenger vessels , to ensure a minimum level of seafarers &apos; training and to reduce pollution from ships .
for improving security in the wake of a number of terrorist outrages , a regulation on enhancing ship and port facilities security was adopted earlier this year , incorporating the SOLAS ISPS measures into EU legislation and expanding them to include domestic traffic .
currently under consideration by the Council are measures to implement the IMO International Safety Management Code within the Community , so penalties can be imposed for certain pollution offences and port security enhanced .
finally , looking ahead , a new package of maritime safety measures is expected to be submitted for examination by the Council in spring 2005 .
I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his reply .
could he give assurances therefore that in the future , depending on the financial perspectives , there will be provision for maritime safety measures from the Union in the coming years ?
- Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the proposal for a directive to impose sanctions for marine pollution remained pending during the Dutch Presidency because certain countries expressed disagreement , including Greece .
I am aware of the fact that Greece proposed certain amendments in order to accept this directive .
can the Council describe to us the content of these amendments which were tabled by the Greek Government ?
. the last question was a more or less new question .
this first question is also on another issue .
we will be having many discussions on the financial perspectives and this is one of the many issues we will discuss .
as you know , the Council has not decided anything on the new financial perspectives .
we have only taken an overview of the so @-@ called building blocks and these building blocks reflect the different positions of the Member States to the Commission &apos;s proposals .
as the author is not present , Question No 7 lapses .
can the Council indicate what funds have been disbursed by the European Union with a view to halting the cultivation of drugs in Afghanistan for the year 2004 and what funds the European Council envisages that it will disburse in this specific policy area over the next two years ?
following the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on Administrative and Legal Cooperation for Consumer Protection , does the Council have any plans to coordinate progress on Member State cooperation on stamping out cross @-@ border fraud and rogue traders operating dishonest prize draws , misleading marketing and similar cross @-@ border crime ?
. Mr President , the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws - the so @-@ called Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation - does not , as such , have any bearing on law enforcement cooperation between Member States .
Member States &apos; police and judicial authorities are already actively cooperating in the fight against all types of crime .
the Council has adopted various instruments on cross @-@ border cooperation in the fight against crime , notably in the context of mutual recognition and enforcement .
these instruments , in principle , have a general scope and are not limited to specific types of crime .
that answer illustrates why I asked the question .
this kind of crime affects citizens from across the European Union ; it is an accelerating form of crime .
Members in this House will know of people who have been scammed , very often vulnerable European citizens - the elderly , for instance .
will the presidency recognise that there are certain forms of crime which are naturally cross @-@ border issues ?
for example , I represent London , where much of this crime takes place , but people are being scammed across the EU .
I should like to ask the Council to take seriously a form of crime that is not being dealt with across borders .
there is too little cooperation between Member States on this kind of growing crime and we know that our European citizens expect us , as parliamentarians , to question you on how effective you can be in solving this kind of cross @-@ border issue .
I want to reinforce the points just made by my colleague .
as an MEP I receive many letters from concerned constituents who have been defrauded by people operating in other Member States of the European Union , particularly through fraud through fax machines , sending false contracts and falsely announcing prize @-@ draw winners .
a lot of these are based in Luxembourg , which will hold the next presidency of the EU .
frankly it brings the EU into disrepute when we are told that there is nothing that can be done about this situation .
if citizens are to gain any advantage from EU cooperation , it should be precisely in tackling these sorts of problems .
. we understand the problem and I take note of your remarks .
unfortunately I have nothing to add to what I said before .
in Darfur , hundreds of people are dying each day from hunger , disease and continued violence , which shows no signs of abating .
70 000 people have already lost their lives and hundreds of thousands of lives are still at risk .
innocent civilians continue to be attacked and the number of displaced people is growing as people flee the violence .
the civilians live in constant fear of attack and rely on humanitarian assistance for food , water and means of survival .
the ongoing violence and insecurity is seriously hampering the humanitarian effort , preventing access to many areas , thus augmenting the suffering and further risking the lives of these innocent people .
in light of the seriousness of this situation , what is being done by the Council to ensure that this crisis is placed and remains high on the agenda of the EU ?
what is the Council doing to ensure that the Sudanese Government is heeding international law and the agreements signed with UN agencies ?
. from its outset , at the beginning of the year , the Darfur crisis has been one of the absolute priorities on the EU agenda .
throughout the year the European Union has been at the forefront of international efforts to contain and resolve the conflict in Darfur , to stop the massive human rights violations taking place there and to prevent an already very serious humanitarian situation from deteriorating further .
Member States and the Community have contributed to the humanitarian relief efforts with more than EUR 325 million .
the Union has also strongly supported the African Union &apos;s leading role in addressing the crisis .
the EU has thus played a key role in support of an AU @-@ led ceasefire monitoring mission and is now actively supporting the deployment of the expanded mission .
almost 60 per cent of the total cost of the expanded AU mission is financed by a contribution of some EUR 80 million from the peace facility , and several Member States are providing additional financial and logistical support for the mission as well as planners and military observers .
the Council has repeatedly , most recently on the occasion of its meeting on 22 November , confirmed its readiness to continue to provide support for the deployment of the mission in terms of financing , logistics and material , as well as personnel if requested .
the Council considers that the deployment of the expanded AU mission in Darfur , together with the EU @-@ led negotiations between the parties to find a political solution for Darfur , offers an opportunity for a comprehensive solution to the Darfur conflict .
in parallel to these efforts , the EU has contributed to the pressure from the international community on all parties to guarantee free and unconditional access for humanitarian aid and to ensure the security of the civilian population .
the Council is closely monitoring compliance by all parties with the demands expressed by the EU and the rest of the international community and the commitments it has undertaken with the UN .
to this end , the EU collaborates closely with the UN Secretary @-@ General &apos;s Special Representative for the Sudan and actively takes part in the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism that evaluates the implementation of the joint communiqué which consists of the commitments of both the Sudanese Government and the United Nations .
in line with Resolutions 1556 and 1564 of the UN Security Council , the Council has also on several occasions reiterated its willingness to take appropriate measures , including sanctions , if no progress is achieved on the commitments made by the Sudanese Government .
Mr President , I thank you for your outline of the situation in the Sudan .
just today we have had news from the relief agencies operating out of Ireland that the situation is worse , not better .
I should like to ask you to indicate when we might actually implement sanctions , as opposed to just threatening them .
over half a million people are now in dire circumstances in the Sudan .
it may have gone from the headlines , but the problem is still there .
. I agree .
as you may know , last Monday the Council also discussed the situation in Sudan and we are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur .
the Council therefore called on all parties to abide in full by their commitments .
we also encouraged them to conclude the negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the SPLMA before the end of the year .
the Council will continue to monitor the situation in Darfur and will consider taking appropriate measures , which could include sanctions in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1565 if no tangible progress is achieved in this respect .
hence the situation is and remains high on the agenda of the European Union .
a tragic event recently took place in Sweden when a truck @-@ driver who had just left the ferry in Trelleborg severely under the influence of alcohol drove against the flow of traffic and five people in two oncoming vehicles were killed .
different approaches to alcohol and different blood @-@ alcohol level limits in different European countries make it more difficult to deal with drink @-@ drivers and to prosecute them , especially in the case of cross @-@ border traffic .
in 2001 , on a proposal from the Commission , the Council decided to recommend that all Member States introduce a maximum blood @-@ alcohol level of 0.2 promille for professional drivers .
the recommendation was adopted instead of a directive on a common upper limit for drivers .
which countries have introduced that upper limit to date ?
is the Council of Ministers re @-@ evaluating its recommendation and what is the outcome of the follow @-@ up at Community level provided for in that recommendation ?
up until now , the Council has not been informed of the outcome of such an evaluation .
that being so , the Council underlines that these conclusions do not call specifically for the introduction of a maximum permitted blood @-@ alcohol content of 0.2 mg for professional drivers .
furthermore , the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that it does not have any information on how many Member States have introduced the aforementioned BAC levels so far .
however , the Council would like to draw the honourable Member &apos;s attention to the Commission recommendation of 6 April 2004 on enforcement in the field of road safety , which , in Recommendation 6 , calls for an intensified application of random breath testing with an alcohol screening device as a leading principle for surveillance of drink driving .
the Council wants to ensure the honourable Member of its strong and ongoing commitment to improving road safety and to tackling all potential sources of road accident fatalities .
in this context it refers to the Council conclusions on road safety from June and December last year , both of which explicitly refer to stricter enforcement , in particular seatbelt use , speeding and drink driving .
in the light of this ongoing commitment the Council had an exchange of views during its meeting on 9 and 10 December 2004 and adopted the Council conclusions on road safety , in which it agreed on the need to focus road safety policies in four important areas , namely enforcement and best practices , vehicle safety , improving safety on European roads and funding road safety .
in this context the Council underlined that , with regard to road safety enforcement , priority should be given , notably , to driver behaviour that causes high accident risks or could have severe consequences such as driving under the influence of alcohol .
Mr President , I wish to thank the Council for its answer , but I am clearly unhappy to hear that the issue is falling into a black hole between the Commission and the Council .
there is every opportunity in this case for the Council to take the initiative .
we know that approximately 10.000 people die on the roads each year because of driving under the influence of alcohol .
we also know that commercial driving is an important area when it comes to getting to grips with drink @-@ driving .
that is why this recommendation is important , and I see no reasons why the Member States should not take these initiatives .
the conclusions also include a paragraph about follow @-@ up , which would permit further discussions about enabling alcohol screening devices to be introduced into cars .
this is a technical invention with which industry too works .
I should like to hear whether discussions are being conducted in the Council about the possibility of introducing alcohol screening devices into vehicles .
. I am sorry my answer did not satisfy the honourable Member .
I thought I had explained the many actions and things we , as a Council , have done to show our commitment to this issue .
we have to put our formal position into effect , as well as the formal position of the Council towards individual Member States .
as I tried to explain before , the matter is now in the hands of the Commission and we await its evaluation and proposals .
the EU &apos;s aspiration to transform itself into the most competitive economy in the world ( Lisbon Agenda ) calls for a significant increase in funding for European research policy .
research spending is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitutes investment in its survival in a fiercely competitive international environment .
however , the declared intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact ( SDP ) , which prohibits Member States &apos; public expenditure from overshooting a budget deficit of 3 % of GDP .
if the Member States are to have an incentive to set aside 1 % of GDP for public funding of research policy , that percentage should not be included in calculating the ceiling of 3 % of GDP laid down by the SDP .
does the Council agree that public spending on research constitutes top priority strategic expenditure for the EU and , as such , can justifiably be excluded from the criteria under the Pact ?
the argument that such a decision will pave the way for a host of other exceptions ( e.g. military spending ) is not tenable since the strengthening of research is an established European strategic goal which has no analogy with any other national or European objectives
. the Council notes that increasing overall expenditure on research is indeed a central element in the Lisbon strategy and one of the keys to making the EU more competitive in the global economy .
the Council and Member States have repeatedly committed themselves to achieving average research and development expenditure of 3 % of GDP by 2010 .
the recent Kok report once again highlighted the need to make good the under @-@ performance in relation to this target .
notwithstanding this general statement , the Council does not share the honourable Member &apos;s view that it is the Stability and Growth Pact which is preventing Member States from achieving the Lisbon objective .
perhaps more fundamentally , the Stability and Growth Pact should be used as a tool to encourage national expenditure on individual budget components over and above others .
firstly , it is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact .
this is a very important point that leads on to the second point that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research .
research funding is rather a matter of national priorities .
thirdly , I would note that the level of R &#91; amp &#93; D expenditure is not solely dependent on public finance .
the target covers privately @-@ funded R &#91; amp &#93; D as well , which can be encouraged by a number of means in addition to public expenditure .
the key to reaching the 3 % target is the two thirds of R &#91; amp &#93; D spending that should be privately funded , not the one third that should come from public funds .
finally , I would like to recall that the Pact is a framework for the management of budgetary policies at global level , with a view to ensuring the sustainability of public finances over the longer term .
all expenditure has to be paid for , even if in the longer run we would hope that investment would have positive returns .
when the Ecofin Council discussed the Pact on 16 November 2004 and this precise issue was raised , there was a broad majority of Member States against pursing the possibility suggested by the Member and excluding certain categories of expenditure from deficit calculations .
in the analytical assessment of the reasons for an excessive deficit , the Council will always take into account the type of expenditure and the likely long @-@ term impact .
but the Council does not share the honourable Member &apos;s assessment regarding the exclusion of R &#91; amp &#93; D expenditure from deficit calculations .
- Mr President , I might have agreed with everything Mr Nicolaï said if I did not believe that we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless research makes a great deal of progress .
thus , if the reply concerned any other subject , I would agree with you .
however , I regret that I must disagree because research is the cornerstone of Lisbon .
. only two EU Member States have already reached the Lisbon goal of 3 % of GDP spent on R &#91; amp &#93; D - Finland and Sweden .
they have achieved this by running budgetary surpluses .
it is clearly possible to fund research while respecting the Pact .
that is an important point .
second , even Germany and France with their well @-@ known budgetary problems have already achieved rates of 2.5 % and 2.2 % respectively .
again , it appears that the Pact is not the factor limiting investment in research .
it would appear to be a matter of national priorities .
that brings us to the end of Question Time .
we are also coming the end of the Dutch Presidency .
I believe that this is the last time that you will be with us for questions to the Council , Mr Nikolaï , and I should like to offer you my best wishes and thanks for your work with Parliament during your Presidency .
I wish you every success at the end of this period , particularly during the next few days , which , I have no doubt , will be extremely demanding .
questions Nos 12 to 31 will be answered in writing .
firstly , I must inform you that , following the invitations for the presentation of the candidatures for the post of European Ombudsman , the deadline for which was 30 September of this year , four candidatures have been presented , of which two will be put forward , namely , those of Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros and Mr Giuseppe Fortunato .
the candidates appeared before the competent committee on 29 November and the election will take place on 11 January next year , according to the procedure laid down in our Rules of Procedure .
the next item is the debate on the report by Mr McMillan @-@ Scott on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 976 / 1999 laying down the requirements for the implementation of Community operations , other than those of development cooperation , which , within the framework of Community cooperation policy , contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at my hearing before the European Parliament some weeks ago , I spoke out in favour of developing the closest possible working relations between the Commission and the European Parliament on human rights and democratisation .
I would like to renew this voluntary commitment wholeheartedly today .
the European Parliament is an extremely important partner for the Commission in this area of work , and so I am keen to follow in the footsteps of my predecessor , Mr Patten , in pursuing a comprehensive and regular dialogue with you on shared issues and concerns .
the purpose of today &apos;s decision is to safeguard the legal basis for the continued existence of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights beyond the end of the year .
this necessitates what I hope will be Parliament &apos;s positive vote on the Commission &apos;s longstanding proposal to extend Regulation ( EC ) No 976 / 1999 for a further two years .
there are just two weeks to go before the Regulation expires , creating the risk that no funding will be available for projects and programmes under the European Initiative in the coming year .
it will only be possible for the Council to adopt a positive decision before the Regulation expires if the European Parliament votes in favour of the draft resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs today .
in my view , this is in everyone &apos;s enlightened interest ; it is also in the political interests of the three institutions involved in the legislative process , and , above all , it is in the practical interests of those whom the projects supported by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights are intended to benefit , namely civil societies and citizens in numerous countries around the world .
the European Initiative is a well @-@ functioning instrument : this is borne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribute to the Initiative and its valuable work .
it is widely regarded as a successful instrument which provides direct support for civil society in many third countries where human rights violations and , above all , a lack of democratic development are endemic .
the Initiative supports numerous innovative and relevant projects , such as the abolition of the death penalty , torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims , the advancement of the rights of women - an issue which is especially dear to me - as well as campaigning for the rights and interests of children , indigenous people and other marginalised groups , and strengthening international law .
this focuses , for example , on the International Criminal Court .
it also aims to foster freedom of expression and promote democratic development through election observation missions .
I believe that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is a vibrant expression of our shared values and , above all , the European Union &apos;s identity in the world .
I agree with the House , Mr President , that the Initiative must be effective and well @-@ managed .
the Commission will therefore scrutinise with attention and interest all the proposals put forward by this House which aim to achieve greater efficiency , the simplification of procedures and the effective use of resources .
to this end , let me give you my assurances that a meaningful , open and , above all , regular dialogue will take place between Parliament and the Commission .
I believe that this dialogue will offer us the opportunity for joint discussion of the political and objective priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights .
after all , Parliament &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s priorities are largely identical ; they include , for example , the need to support the European Union &apos;s Neighbourhood Policy via the Initiative or to reinforce democratic development in a number of countries .
it is therefore important , in my view - and this applies both to my own and the working level - for us to focus on the same priorities , examine the needs arising in our Neighbourhood Policy together , and set the best possible priorities on a joint basis .
as parliamentarians , you have acquired particular expertise which I would like to draw on .
your support for the democracy movement in Ukraine or the forthcoming EU Election Observer Mission to Palestine , the West Bank and Gaza are eloquent examples , and all I can say is that I believe we will work well together here .
let me conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by expressing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the modalities for this further dialogue as swiftly as possible in order to develop genuinely fruitful cooperation in this field in everyone &apos;s interest .
I look forward to our positive cooperation , and I gladly put my services at your disposal .
. Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for her opening remarks .
I am very pleased to see in the Chamber Mrs Morgantini , the chairman of the Committee on Development , Mrs Flautre , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights , the shadow rapporteur and my co @-@ rapporteur on the Committee on Development , Mr Fernández Martín .
there were two regulations , one of which has already been adopted by this House .
the one we are dealing with now is that covering third countries .
twelve years ago I was rapporteur and , as Mr Patten has described me , &apos; father &apos; of the European initiative for democracy and human rights , which proved to be instrumental in helping the transitional ex @-@ Soviet bloc countries .
it was considered by many as the European Union &apos;s flagship scheme for democracy promotion .
it gave meaning to the preamble to the Maastricht Treaty concerning the EU &apos;s foreign policy priorities .
in its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in Brussels , with both the European Parliament and the Commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects .
at its height in 1997 , the initiative was financing and administering around 1 200 projects .
in 1999 I visited some of them in Belgrade , including key pro @-@ democracy media , such as Radio B92 .
the same year the initiative was taken in @-@ house by the Commission .
I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureaucratic and safe and that the European Parliament , as the only democratically elected institution , should once again play a greater role .
although the initiative currently has a budget of some EUR 137 million , it lacks visibility and effectiveness .
I am all the more convinced of this following meetings on the ground and discussions with more than 30 organisations .
most recently , I spoke to the Association of Belarusian Journalists - currently here to receive the Sakharov Prize - as well as the Eurasia Director of a US pro @-@ democracy agency .
they were not even aware of the existence of the European democracy initiative .
this is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective .
an important point to make is that unlike routine EU assistance , the European initiative does not require the host government &apos;s consent .
in a country such as Belarus , not to speak of Tunisia or Iran , in which operating through government channels is difficult and often impossible , this cannot be underestimated .
in a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003 , Javier Solana outlined the importance and sensitivity of Europe &apos;s new neighbourhood .
the resulting policy invites our neighbours to the east and south to share in the peace , stability and prosperity that we enjoy in the European Union .
it aims to create a &apos; ring of friends &apos; around the borders of the new enlarged European Union .
sadly , the only visibility of the EU &apos;s democracy activities in the new neighbourhood seems to be short observation missions by Members of the European Parliament , such as those undertaken recently in Ukraine .
I believe that all significant elections in the new neighbourhood should be the subject of full EU observation missions .
there is a feeling in Brussels that democracy cannot be exported and that change must come from within .
however , the United States National Endowment for Democracy has shown since 1982 that the two can be combined .
it operates as an independent expert agency , using NGOs on the ground , and is much respected for its programmes and methodology .
as well as the United States activities , the Westminster Foundation , for example , or the German and other NGOs have higher visibility and much less bureaucracy than the European initiative .
I recently put together a document detailing the European Parliament &apos;s pro @-@ democracy activities , both within the EU and externally .
as Members , we participate in a myriad of interparliamentary delegations , consultation committees and informal groups .
valuable work is being done , but the work is fragmented .
