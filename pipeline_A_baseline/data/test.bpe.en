possible aid@@ s could be national Lisbon plans , a number of structural indic@@ ators , involving national parliaments in monitoring and assess@@ ing the process and certainly also a classi@@ fication of the Member States according to per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
in addition , we would also urge you to ensure that the ess@@ ence of the Stability and Growth Pact remains in@@ tac@@ t .
that is something about which a number of Members have had a lot to say .
finally , we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in services , but in the right way , that is , with the support of the public and of civil society .
we are also expec@@ ting proposals aimed at improving the investment climate , including for the medium @-@ sized and small enterprises that are still the dri@@ ving force of our economic growth .
we all know that without any growth , there are no jobs , and without any jobs , there is no basis for social security , which we are all very keen to see protected .
Mr President , you have an ar@@ du@@ ous task , all the more so because the Constitution has not yet been approved and the financial perspec@@ tives are as yet un@@ known .
we are , in fact , asking you to serve up a men@@ u without having a k@@ it@@ ch@@ en to prepare it and without know@@ ing what budget is available .
however , we are coun@@ ting on your cre@@ ati@@ vity and on a good te@@ am spirit among your people .
if , in January , you propose sol@@ id policy and dis@@ h up a consistent me@@ al , you will have a las@@ ting ally in the PPE @-@ DE Group .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have lis@@ tened to each and every one of you most atten@@ tively .
I thank you for your contributions , which reflect a wide vari@@ ety of views in this Parliament .
I also eag@@ er@@ ly a@@ wait the result of your vote next Th@@ urs@@ day .
the resolution that is then adopted will certainly be very important for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union .
at this time I think I might already draw three prov@@ isi@@ onal conclusions .
first , I note that the great majority of speakers agree with the need to define priorities that cor@@ respond to the public &apos;s expectations and think it important that the European Union and its institutions should respond to the primary concerns of European citizens .
secondly , the great majority of speakers identi@@ fied three basic areas for action : the area we can call Lisbon , the Lisbon strategy ( economic reform with a social and environmental dimension ) ; the areas connec@@ ted with security and justice ; and Europe &apos;s role in the world .
thirdly , I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a pro@@ active cohesion policy , a true solidarity policy in Europe .
I particularly hope that the Member States &quot; Govern@@ ments have taken careful note of this .
accord@@ ingly , I feel that we can conclude that there is consensus regarding Europe &apos;s need for growth and employment .
without growth , without job creation and without greater dyna@@ mis@@ m in our economy , we shall be unable to maintain the high levels of social protection and the exac@@ ting environmental standards that we regard as part of what is nor@@ m@@ ally called the European model .
what is at sta@@ ke is not , and never has been , the destruction of the European model .
what is truly at sta@@ ke is the need to adap@@ t and to modern@@ ise this European model , and to take account of a number of new challenges that are now making themselves felt across Europe and the world .
the increasing age of our population , the effects of globalisation - all this requires Europe to adap@@ t and change within this more competitive context .
I am pleased to say that I do not believe that concerns for economic efficiency and concerns for social justice are mu@@ tually in@@ compatible .
these objectives - greater competitiveness al@@ ong@@ side sustainable development and social concern - cannot in any way be in@@ compatible .
we have to work to make them compatible .
these are objectives that define one of our priorities .
I therefore believe we must work towards achieving the broad@@ est possible consensus , but a dyna@@ mic consensus and one that is not the result of can@@ cell@@ ing out oppos@@ ing points of view , because we also have to recognise that there are some contradic@@ tory priorities here in Parliament .
accord@@ ingly , we have to identi@@ fy the highest common den@@ om@@ ina@@ tor for a dyna@@ mic consensus .
I think that one consensus that has clearly emer@@ ged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged Europe .
we have a Europe in the process of re@@ uni@@ fication .
our enlargement is an enlargement that has only just be@@ gu@@ n .
we have signed the tre@@ aties and have ten new Member States among us , but we have to do all we can so that we can soon stop talking about old and new Member States and become a real Union , and for that we need an active cohesion policy .
that is why I keep re@@ turning to the idea of a plan of values , and solidarity is certainly a value that can un@@ ite us .
that is why I say that now , when I see the issue of European id@@ entity being deb@@ ated so often in Europe , I have to stress that it is ro@@ o@@ ted in respect for our various national , regional and local id@@ ent@@ ities .
European diversity is what truly defin@@ es our id@@ entity and , if we want to define id@@ entity , we must define it in terms of the values en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the European Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , that is , respect for the dignity of the human being , for human rights , for justice , for the rule of law and for the principles of freedom and equality .
these are the values that define our id@@ entity .
respect for the principle of non @-@ discrimination and toler@@ ance towards anyone who comes in through our borders .
it is therefore on the basis of these values that we can promote the idea of Europe around the world .
I said in my first speech that it is on the basis of these values that we can best look after our interests .
we are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy : a policy for our E@@ as@@ tern or Mediterranean neighbours that promo@@ tes stability and peace , as we have been doing in Ukraine , for example .
I should like to under@@ line something that has not always been put into words .
the sig@@ n@@ als that the European Union has sent out during the current crisis in Ukraine have been highly positive .
without any competition for the lim@@ eli@@ ght , we have had the Council Presidency , the European Council , the European Commission and some Member States all involved in seeking a peaceful , democratic solution for Ukraine .
that reflec@@ ts very well on our Europe .
we must also , however , have a gener@@ ous development policy .
as I have already said , Europe cannot be sel@@ fish .
the policy must reflect ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally what we now do inter@@ n@@ ally , having overcome a great many histor@@ ical conflicts by means of coll@@ abor@@ ation between Member States that were very often at war with each other in the past .
that is why I believe we have the duty to advoc@@ ate effective multila@@ ter@@ alism , where@@ by we work on a pla@@ t@@ form of equality and respect with our princi@@ p@@ al partners , we seek to re@@ vi@@ ta@@ lis@@ e the transatlan@@ tic alli@@ ance , and un@@ ite all our partners around values such as freedom , peace and democracy .
that is how Europe prog@@ res@@ ses - by en@@ ric@@ hing its her@@ ita@@ ge , by building and rene@@ wing a dyna@@ mic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qu@@ alities that make it so different .
I should like to fin@@ ish , ladies and gentlemen , by as@@ suring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliament &apos;s positions , so as to incorpor@@ ate those positions into what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or another , but a strategic vision for all European institutions and for the European Union as a whole throughout the next five years .
at the conclusion of this debate , I have received six mo@@ tions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 10@@ 3 of the Rules of Procedure . ( 1 )
the vote will take place on Th@@ urs@@ day .
the debate is closed .
we shall proceed to the for@@ mal sitting for the a@@ ward of the S@@ ak@@ har@@ o@@ v P@@ ri@@ z@@ e to the Association of J@@ our@@ n@@ alists of Belarus .
it is a great hon@@ our and ple@@ asure for me to welcome the w@@ inn@@ ers of the S@@ ak@@ har@@ o@@ v P@@ ri@@ z@@ e 2004 , a pri@@ z@@ e which the European Parliament is awar@@ ding to the Association of J@@ our@@ n@@ alists of Belarus , head@@ ed by its President , Mrs Z@@ h@@ ann@@ a L@@ it@@ vina .
I would like to welcome you in your language : , Mrs L@@ it@@ vina .
I must inform Parliament that the representatives of the Association of J@@ our@@ n@@ alists of Belarus include S@@ v@@ et@@ l@@ ana Z@@ ava@@ d@@ s@@ ka@@ y@@ a , whose h@@ us@@ b@@ and has been mis@@ sing since July 2000 .
we wish to express our sy@@ mpa@@ thy and solidarity with Mrs Z@@ ava@@ d@@ s@@ ka@@ y@@ a and her family at this very difficult time .
this pri@@ z@@ e recogn@@ ises a group of profession@@ als who risk their lives on a daily basis to seek out the truth and commun@@ icate it to their citizens .
in 2004 , more than 50 journ@@ alists have been mur@@ der@@ ed throughout the world , together with 14 media assis@@ tants .
around 200 have been imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ed and we should remember that two French journ@@ alists have been held in Iraq for more than 100 days now .
2004 has not been Belarus &apos;s best year .
the pressure from the authorities on the independent media has increased consider@@ ably .
the State has continued to sil@@ ence critical vo@@ ices , im@@ pos@@ ing fin@@ es , syste@@ ma@@ tically suspen@@ ding and clos@@ ing new@@ s@@ paper@@ s , har@@ ass@@ ing journ@@ alists and taking criminal action against them .
freedom is what society has the right to do and know and what the State does not have the right to hin@@ der .
in Belarus , however , it is hin@@ der@@ ed .
within Belarus &apos;s dicta@@ tor@@ ial system , the result of elections not recognised by the international community , access to information not fil@@ tered by the authorities involves risk , and the Association of J@@ our@@ n@@ alists of Belarus and its one thou@@ s@@ and members , being awar@@ ded this pri@@ z@@ e today , run that risk every day .
having suffer@@ ed various methods of traditional c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , the Association manag@@ es , coura@@ ge@@ ously , to broad@@ c@@ ast its information via the Internet .
but the authorities continue to pursue you and , nevertheless , you continue to try to keep the public aware of the right to freedom of expression and the need to exercise it .
the attacks suffer@@ ed by your Association are attacks against fundamental human rights , which are en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the Charter of Rights and in the draft European Constitution .
Madam President , I would like to inform you that we in the European Parliament have decided that our Del@@ e@@ gation for R@@ el@@ ations with Belarus will not maintain relations with the authorities of the regime , and will only maintain them and promote them with the NGOs and with civil society .
we are all sa@@ d@@ den@@ ed and f@@ r@@ ustra@@ ted to note that , 15 years after the fall of the Berl@@ in W@@ all , v@@ esti@@ ges of that arti@@ fic@@ ial div@@ ision of Europe still remain .
we are f@@ r@@ ustra@@ ted to know that in Belarus the death penalty is still in force , and it is the only country in this continent which still applies it .
the pri@@ z@@ e we are awar@@ ding today remin@@ ds us that there are borders within Europe which restric@@ t the application of our values .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you that our Parliament us@@ u@@ ally sta@@ ys in contact with previous w@@ inn@@ ers of the S@@ ak@@ har@@ o@@ v pri@@ z@@ e and that this month it will be 14 years since we awar@@ ded this pri@@ z@@ e to A@@ un@@ g S@@ an Su@@ u Ky@@ i , who is still under arrest in M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r , and whose immediate rele@@ ase we continue to demand .
Madam President , perhaps I should make it absolutely clear that , when you have re@@ turned to your country , we will continue to support you through all of our resources and we call on the Belar@@ u@@ sian authorities to respect your rights and freedoms .
I would like to congratulate you on the work you are doing in Belar@@ u@@ sian : , Mrs L@@ it@@ vina .
you have the floor .
( 1 ) Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , La@@ dies and G@@ ent@@ lem@@ en , this is a very em@@ o@@ tional moment for me , because this is an extremely important , significant moment for my colleagues and I@@ . The fact that we are receiv@@ ing this pri@@ z@@ e as an organisation is a sign of solidarity and support for the entire Belar@@ u@@ sian democratic movement and support for the political forces that will finally ensure that in future there will be a link between Belarus and the European Union .
the fact that this pri@@ z@@ e was initi@@ ally put forward for two Belar@@ u@@ sian organisations - the second organisation was the y@@ outh organisation Z@@ U@@ B@@ R - is probably a sign that Belarus is the focus of international attention and that my country , which one of my colleagues has described as a ch@@ ess pi@@ ece which has fall@@ en off the ch@@ ess board , will once again become an independent entity in European politics and will one day take a wor@@ thy place among the other nations around the European table .
the pri@@ z@@ e is such an important signal for us because we understand our problems , but they are not just a matter of up@@ holding our own professional principles .
it is also about def@@ ending the rights of all our citizens to receive objective , un@@ cen@@ so@@ red information .
it is extremely important that our problems are understood by you and by European politicians .
unfortunately , the Belar@@ u@@ sian authorities have managed to create a closed society buil@@ t on is@@ ol@@ ation and dis@@ da@@ in for democratic values .
they protect their stability and sur@@ vi@@ val by means of total control over the f@@ low of information .
the electronic media are almost totally monopol@@ ised by the authorities .
the situation is worse because the work of these monopol@@ ised media is direc@@ ted at dis@@ cre@@ d@@ iting any political ad@@ vers@@ aries , and the monopol@@ ised media try to reinfor@@ ce ste@@ re@@ o@@ types and my@@ ths .
one such wid@@ es@@ pread my@@ th in Belarus is that nobody in Europe is w@@ at@@ ching us , nobody ex@@ pects us to join them and Europe is h@@ os@@ ti@@ le and ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive towards us , the only guarantee of stability in our country is the head of state , and so on and so for@@ th .
despite our constitutional provisions , there is only one obli@@ g@@ atory ide@@ ology that pre@@ va@@ ils in Belarus now .
in Belarus a process has now been comple@@ ted - the creation of a new state structure which is known as the ide@@ ological &apos; ver@@ tical &apos; .
there is total in@@ toler@@ ance of criticism and we are not allowed to ob@@ ject or express our views .
my colleagues know that we are subject to use of the criminal co@@ de against us if we critic@@ ise the President .
two years ago , P@@ ava@@ l Ma@@ z@@ he@@ ik@@ a , a young journ@@ alist , was given a pris@@ on sen@@ tence under the criminal co@@ de .
during political campa@@ ig@@ ns there is even more pressure on the non @-@ state press ; the referendum and the recent parliamentary elections are a case in point .
on the eve of the referendum my colleague , E@@ l@@ ena R@@ av@@ bet@@ s@@ ka@@ y@@ a , the ed@@ itor of the new@@ s@@ paper published an ar@@ ticle in which she said that calling the referendum was &apos; a challenge to society &apos; and that to carry it out required a total lack of con@@ sci@@ ence and total ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t of public opinion .
my colleague was also tried and fin@@ ed as a result .
her new@@ s@@ paper has also been pun@@ ished and has been closed down for three months as a result of that ar@@ ticle .
again , two weeks ago , a very well @-@ known person , Gar@@ ry Pa@@ han@@ i@@ a@@ yl@@ a , V@@ ice @-@ President of the Belarus Hel@@ sin@@ ki Committee , was also sen@@ ten@@ ced for s@@ lan@@ der against the state .
the reason for this was a c@@ ass@@ ette ta@@ p@@ ed by a Swedish television journ@@ alist , which was conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated from him at the border .
Mr Pa@@ han@@ i@@ a@@ yl@@ a had given an inter@@ view and mentioned the na@@ mes of those sus@@ pec@@ ted of involvement in the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance of Belar@@ u@@ sian opposition politicians .
that was sufficient for them to bring him to trial and he may well be imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ed for five years as a result .
we are very concerned that , despite the conclusions reached in the report on the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ces of Belar@@ u@@ sian politicians and journ@@ alists by Ch@@ ris@@ to@@ s P@@ our@@ g@@ ur@@ ides , a Council of Europe special rapporteur , and despite the international community &apos;s close attention to this subject , it seems that the Belar@@ u@@ sian authorities are still not interested in a full in @-@ de@@ p@@ th investi@@ gation of these dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ces or in publis@@ hing such an investi@@ gation .
we still do not know what happened to D@@ mit@@ ry Z@@ ava@@ d@@ s@@ ky , who dis@@ appe@@ ared four years ago .
he is a journ@@ alist and a member of our organisation and the authorities have never told us what happened to him .
his wi@@ f@@ e , S@@ v@@ et@@ l@@ ana Z@@ ava@@ d@@ s@@ ka@@ y@@ a , is on our delegation .
the issue of the dis@@ appe@@ ared is still in the new@@ s@@ paper@@ s .
three years ago , during the presid@@ ential election campaign , we were pun@@ ished for men@@ tioning this .
there was direct c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
at the beginning of this year , in the last campaign for parliamentary elections and the referendum , we saw for the first time the sum@@ mar@@ y clos@@ ure of new@@ s@@ paper@@ s at the be@@ h@@ est of the Minis@@ try of In@@ for@@ mation . there were 19 cases of sus@@ pension of the activities of independent media out@@ l@@ ets .
our colleague , An@@ dre@@ y S@@ han@@ ta@@ ro@@ v@@ ich , actually w@@ ent on hun@@ ger strik@@ e as a result of his paper being sh@@ ut down .
after the hun@@ ger strik@@ e he was char@@ ged with car@@ rying out an un@@ author@@ ised prote@@ st .
this was ab@@ sur@@ d .
the information about his hun@@ ger strik@@ e had been published all around the c@@ ity and , as a result , he was fin@@ ed for the hun@@ ger strik@@ e .
suspen@@ ding the activities of new@@ s@@ paper@@ s is aimed firstly at h@@ it@@ ting the new@@ s@@ paper@@ s econom@@ ically .
economic discrimination has become one of the ways of restric@@ ting the activities of the independent press .
my colleagues in the press are coming up against major obstacles in the distribution of their new@@ s@@ paper@@ s .
the distribution of alternative , acc@@ ura@@ te information to citizens is one of the major problems facing our society .
if a pub@@ l@@ ication critic@@ ises the authorities , this autom@@ ati@@ cally lead@@ s to problems with the prin@@ ting h@@ ous@@ es .
according to the Minis@@ try of In@@ for@@ mation , there are hun@@ dre@@ ds of independent prin@@ ting pres@@ ses , but already five independent pub@@ lic@@ ations can no longer be prin@@ ted in our country ; they have to be prin@@ ted in S@@ m@@ ol@@ ens@@ k in Russia because they cannot use prin@@ ting pres@@ ses on Belar@@ u@@ sian territory .
I can say quite categ@@ or@@ ically that the journ@@ alists - my colleagues from the independent press - remain true to the principles of their prof@@ ession .
the independent press , which still appears in Belarus , is vir@@ tually the only institution which exerc@@ ises any scru@@ tin@@ y over the state and it is the only source of free information to citizens .
it would not be possible for us to sur@@ vi@@ ve without the collective support of international and European organisations .
I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribu@@ te to Article 19 ; to the International F@@ eder@@ ation of J@@ our@@ n@@ alists ; Re@@ por@@ ters without B@@ orders ; the International L@@ eag@@ ue for Human Rights ; the Danish organisations ; the Hel@@ sin@@ ki Committee from Sweden and Nor@@ way ; the C@@ en@@ tre of Ex@@ tre@@ me J@@ our@@ n@@ alism , as it is called - a Russian organisation ; and the G@@ las@@ n@@ ost Def@@ ence F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation .
all these are part@@ ner organisations that are helping us , and our streng@@ th lies in this partnership and cooperation .
it is very important for us that European society and the European institutions should not wea@@ ken their position with regard to the principles of freedom of speech and human rights .
if there were to be any wea@@ ken@@ ing of those positions , then the repres@@ sive ma@@ ch@@ ine within Belarus would start to go into over@@ dri@@ ve and we would feel even more pressure against us .
recently , at international level , many politicians from eas@@ tern European countries have expressed their concerns about the situation in Belarus and are prepared to work towards for@@ mula@@ ting a strategy towards Belarus at European level .
I would like to express our support for that and the certainty that a common European strategy towards Belarus will emer@@ ge and will very much help our situation .
we can only combat a tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian regime by creating an open information society ; a society that would encourage debate ; a for@@ um - which is a place for people to receive acc@@ ura@@ te information .
we have a comprehensive programme which we feel will help to un@@ lo@@ ck the situation in our country .
we are prepared to discuss that with you .
I will just mention a few of the priorities .
we need support for what is legal and what is still working in Belarus .
basi@@ cally , what I am referring to is the independent press and the non @-@ governmental organisations that are still operating in our country .
what is also very important for us is the effect of the strength@@ ened presence of the European Union in Belarus - something that we would encourage .
perhaps there is some way of establishing a European Union special representative for Belarus .
we feel it is very important that our people should receive a message from the European Union . its value would be that our return to Europe depen@@ ds on us , the Belar@@ u@@ sian people .
we understand that today , Belarus &apos;s vis@@ iting c@@ ard unfortunately imp@@ lies the Lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko regime .
in fact there are ten million people in our country and at least half of those associ@@ ate the future of our country with a return to Europe .
I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Members of the European Parliament - especially the members of the delegation to Belarus - to support our proposals with regard to sta@@ ging hear@@ ings on the media situation in Belarus .
such hear@@ ings might lead to recommendations on bringing our legislation into line with European standards and would help us to dem@@ on@@ opol@@ ise the mass media .
once again , I thank you for this a@@ ward .
ladies and gentlemen , the for@@ mal sitting is closed .
Mr President , pursu@@ ant to Rule 16@@ 6 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament , I should like to en@@ qu@@ ire on what legal basis the min@@ i@@ a@@ ture national fla@@ gs were remo@@ ved from the se@@ ats occu@@ pi@@ ed by Pol@@ ish Members from the L@@ eag@@ ue of Pol@@ ish F@@ am@@ il@@ ies ?
is there any legal basis for remo@@ ving some@@ one else &apos;s proper@@ ty , and on whose orders were the fla@@ gs remo@@ ved ?
we insist they be re@@ turned immediately .
as far as we are concerned , they are hol@@ y .
in addition , I fail to see how they could be d@@ et@@ r@@ imen@@ tal to the European Parliament .
this is an important issue , ladies and gentlemen .
as you will be aware , we do follow the Charter of Fundamental Rights in absolutely def@@ ending the right to proper@@ ty .
this morning , the House &apos;s services were informed that a number of fla@@ gs that had been in this Chamber were no longer there .
even after pa@@ ins@@ taking investi@@ gations , it has not been possible to determin@@ e who remo@@ ved them and where they are now .
I would ask the ind@@ ul@@ g@@ ence of the Pol@@ ish and other Members .
we will continue our investi@@ gations and hope that the fla@@ gs will turn up some@@ where , but , for the moment , they have simply dis@@ appe@@ ared .
I must , however , point out , ladies and gentlemen , that it has not hi@@ ther@@ to been good practice in this House for individual dele@@ gations to use fla@@ gs to mark where they sit .
let me further point out to you that the B@@ ure@@ au , at the request of one of the V@@ ice @-@ Presidents , considered this issue yesterday and that this issue of fla@@ gs is on the agenda for the next meeting of the B@@ ure@@ au , which will deal with the matter .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
.
Mr President , in accordance with the Rules , I had asked to make a comment about this report , and I am sor@@ ry I was not called before the vote .
I rise not because this is a contro@@ versi@@ al report for this Parliament - on the contrary , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted it over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly ; and I am glad that Parliament has done so too , because it is about fair@@ ness and ensuring equality of opportunity between all 25 Member States .
all this report does is to per@@ mit the 10 new Member States to take advantage of an exper@@ imen@@ tal scheme for applying reduced rates of V@@ A@@ T to labour @-@ inten@@ sive services , which 9 of the previous 15 had been doing since 1999 .
the scheme was une@@ x@@ pec@@ tedly carried forward and therefore was not included in the enlargement negotiations .
I am very pleased that this vote has carried today .
however , this a contro@@ versi@@ al matter in the Council .
indeed , unanim@@ ity is required even for this report to be implemented by the Council .
I regret to say that my own Member State , the UK , is one of those which has &apos; reser@@ vations &apos; about this ; and some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fe@@ ared that perhaps the UK or others might tor@@ pe@@ do this report .
but , more than that , this Parliament has , since the start of the exper@@ im@@ ent , wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly supported the principle .
I hope that this vote today will encourage the Council to ensure fair@@ ness across all 25 Member States for the remain@@ ing time of the current exper@@ im@@ ent ; and I also say , with the full support of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mrs Ber@@ è@@ s , that we should be pres@@ sing the Council to make this a permanent fe@@ a@@ ture of our hop@@ es of achieving the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy .
I hope Parliament will support that .
that conclu@@ des the vote .
.@@ - I voted for the request for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee - European Agricul@@ tural Fund for R@@ ural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricul@@ tural Fund for R@@ ural Development ( E@@ A@@ F@@ R@@ D ) .
I consider that the European Economic and Social Committee should be consul@@ ted in view of the strategic importance of the common agricultural policy reforms in 2003 and 2004 .
since it has been concluded that the main target of policy reform in the new financial period should be rural development , it must also be under@@ lined that more than half of the EU @-@ 25 population lives in rural areas , which cover 90 % of our territory .
rural development is therefore an important political area , a fact that was reite@@ ra@@ ted in the conclusions of the Lisbon ( March 2000 ) and Go@@ th@@ en@@ burg ( June 2001 ) European Coun@@ c@@ ils .
I think it is essential , then , that we , together with the various institutional pla@@ yers , should find measures that will help to monitor and to further suppl@@ ement the CAP reforms and to ensure that they are consistent with first pillar instruments and policies , and that will also contribute to other political priorities of the European Union , such as the sustainable management of natural resources , innovation and competitiveness in rural areas , as well as economic and social cohesion .
.@@ - I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regi@@ ons - E@@ R@@ D@@ F , E@@ S@@ F and the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation la@@ ying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund .
I consider that one of the fundamental instruments behind the solidarity that defin@@ es the European Union is its cohesion policy - a policy that must be ambitious and able to address the challenges of the latest enlargement and the new pros@@ pects for economic growth in Europe .
consultation of the Committee of the Regi@@ ons is essential in view of the strategic importance of these funds .
the Union &apos;s cohesion policy makes an important contribution towards achieving its growth and cohesion objectives because , by reducing economic and social dis@@ par@@ ities , the Union is helping to ensure that all regions and social groups can contribute .
.@@ - I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regi@@ ons - E@@ R@@ D@@ F on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Regional Development Fund .
I think this consultation is essential in view of the importance of the E@@ R@@ D@@ F in correc@@ ting regional im@@ balan@@ ces .
regional dis@@ par@@ ities within the EU have become worse since the recent enlargement , because there has been a huge increase in the number of under@@ developed regions .
I consider the harmon@@ ious development of the various regions of Europe to be a constan@@ t challenge to which we must respond with clear objectives and firm political decisions .
the development of the Community &apos;s territory , which has increased with enlargement , requires greater territor@@ ial cooperation , based on joint local development projects within the context of cross @-@ border cooperation and on measures leading to integrated territor@@ ial development , for which we need the participation of all the regional pla@@ yers .
.@@ - I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regi@@ ons - C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund .
the contribution that the Committee of the Regi@@ ons can make to the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund review process is in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble , since this is the fund that will help to finance projects in the fields of the environment and tr@@ ans @-@ European networks on the subject of transport infrastructure .
I believe that this review should re@@ tain the basic principles that define this policy and base itself on a global balance between strengthening the strategic dimension on the one hand and simp@@ lif@@ ying the implementation system on the other , without thereby creating a situation that reduc@@ es solidarity among the Member States , which is both a principle and a character@@ is@@ tic of this Union of States .
.@@ - I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regi@@ ons - European group@@ ing of cross @-@ border cooperation ( E@@ G@@ C@@ C ) on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European group@@ ing of cross @-@ border cooperation ( E@@ G@@ C@@ C ) .
the Committee of the Regi@@ ons ought to be consul@@ ted in view of the importance of the powers exerc@@ ised by bodies with local and regional power in their capacity as public authorities .
in view of the serious difficulties en@@ coun@@ tered by the Member States , regions and local authorities in car@@ rying out and manag@@ ing cross @-@ border , trans@@ national and inter@@ regional cooperation measures in a context of different national laws and procedures , it is essential to adopt adequate measures at Community level to alle@@ vi@@ ate such difficulties .
this new Community @-@ level cooperation instrument will allow the creation of Community territory of co@@ oper@@ ative group@@ ings with their own legal person@@ ality , called &apos; European group@@ ings of cross @-@ border cooperation &quot; ( E@@ G@@ C@@ C ) .
the harmon@@ ious development of the Community as a whole and the strengthening of economic , social and territor@@ ial cohesion require a strengthening of cross @-@ border cooperation and the adoption of measures providing for the remo@@ val of obstacles that hin@@ der cross @-@ border cooperation .
.@@ - The full , harmon@@ ious integration of the ten new Member States requires the adap@@ tation of all pro@@ to@@ c@@ ols pre@@ viously con@@ fin@@ ed to the 15 Member States , and it also requires that this adap@@ tation should take place as soon as possible .
.@@ - T@@ his proposal is the result of the author@@ isation granted by the Council of the European Union to the European Commission on 26 January 2004 to under@@ take and conclude negotiations with M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , with a view to the conclusion of an A@@ d@@ d@@ itional Protocol to the Economic Par@@ t@@ nership , Pol@@ it@@ ical Co@@ ordin@@ ation and Co@@ operation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States , of the one part , and the United M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an States , of the other part , to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the European Union .
the accession of the above @-@ mentioned new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adap@@ tations so as to place them on an equal fo@@ o@@ ting in the custom@@ s , economic and competition fields .
I voted for the proposal .

the accession of these new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adap@@ tations so as to place them on an equal fo@@ o@@ ting in the custom@@ s , economic and competition fields . I have voted for the proposal .
.@@ - I voted for the proposal for a Council directive because I believe it has already been affor@@ ded sufficient une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cal scru@@ tin@@ y and appreci@@ ation in the Committee on Agriculture , where it ga@@ ined well @-@ deser@@ ved , unanim@@ ous approval .
nonetheless , I wonder whether it is wor@@ th@@ while and necessary for such questions that merely correct or up@@ date legislation to have to follow the same procedure ( al@@ be@@ it simp@@ li@@ fied ) as other reports that deal with signific@@ antly more important to@@ pic@@ s .
in fact , in the case in point , I believe that the change made to Directive 8@@ 7 / 3@@ 28 / E@@ EC can only be understood in the light of an exces@@ sively pos@@ iti@@ vis@@ t interpre@@ tation of Community law , since the s@@ tor@@ age of fro@@ z@@ en sem@@ en of bo@@ v@@ ine animals that is provided for at &apos; sem@@ en collec@@ tion c@@ ent@@ res &quot; ( with own production ) could , by rec@@ our@@ se to ordinary rules of legal interpre@@ tation , include the &apos; sem@@ en s@@ tor@@ age c@@ ent@@ res &quot; ( without own production ) without any for@@ mal correc@@ tion being necessary .
it may sound tri@@ vi@@ al , but sometimes even the rid@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous can be treated seriously , or something serious can seem rid@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous .
.@@ - I welcome the proposal to amen@@ d the Council regulation on support for rural development from the E@@ A@@ G@@ G@@ F &apos; in order to prevent any difference in treatment between the Member States &quot; that made up the European Union before enlargement and the current 25 countries .
it should be noted that this measure ar@@ ises in the context of a debate on the budget in which there will be a real cut in funds compared with the pre @-@ enlargement period .
that means the contin@@ uation of a policy where@@ by support for rural development is used as part of a strategy to contain common agricultural policy costs , to liber@@ alise agricultural markets and to negoti@@ ate with the World Trade Organisation .
such measures , however , do not address the need to correct the prof@@ ound in@@ jus@@ tic@@ es present in the European Union &apos;s agricultural policy and do not help the necessary and urgent dri@@ ve for economic and social cohesion between its various Member States .
the effective promotion of rural development requires farmers , agricultural production and a model of sustainable human development based on the enhan@@ cement of economic , social and cultural specific@@ ities and di@@ vers@@ ities .
the June Lis@@ t &apos;s three members voted against the report , since it is an integra@@ l part of the provisions for the common agricultural policy , which we wish to abol@@ ish .
the common agricultural policy basi@@ cally needs to be re@@ formed , and the debate on its reform must begin without delay .
we believe that , as early as 2005 , the EU should begin cu@@ tting back on agricultural aid .
as a rule , the members of the June Lis@@ t cannot therefore vote in favour of the various reports within the agricultural sp@@ here that are presented to the European Parliament .
. - W@@ e consider it right in principle that the level of participation in programmes supporting rural development by countries which acc@@ ed@@ ed to the EU on 1 May 2004 should be balanced with that of the existing Member States .
nonetheless , we are im@@ pres@@ sed by the as@@ surance that this balan@@ cing act will be achieved at no financial cost to the Community budget , given that the participation of the ten new countries in the programmes will increase from 80 % to 8@@ 5 % , and by the fact that it concerns objective 1 regions only , lea@@ ving the question of the other regions un@@ clear .
what is ultimately important is not the siz@@ e of the appropriations and the number of programmes , but their ori@@ entation , which is ac@@ u@@ tely anti @-@ farming and h@@ os@@ ti@@ le to any real rural development .
.@@ - S@@ in@@ ce this proposal concerns an amendment to the regulation in order to prevent any difference in treatment between the old Member States and those that acc@@ ed@@ ed during this year &apos;s enlargement , and since there is no budgetary change resul@@ ting from that amendment , I am in favour of it .
.@@ - I recognise that the Member States that join@@ ed the Community on 1 May 2004 deser@@ ve at least the same treatment from its institutions as that granted to the ol@@ der Member States .
I therefore voted for the proposed amendment , since it aims at preventing a situation of ine@@ quality from ar@@ ising as regards the limit of the financial contributions to be made under Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 5@@ 7 / 1999 , in that it is prefer@@ able to apply the third ind@@ ent of the second sub@@ paragraph of Article 4@@ 7 ( 2 ) to the new Member States .
.@@ - T@@ his is an administrative issue but one that is correct in terms of accoun@@ ting practice since it pu@@ ts right a situation that was justified before Austria join@@ ed the Union but no longer makes sense .
I am therefore in favour of this report .
.@@ - The mil@@ k produced in the Austri@@ an regions of K@@ le@@ in@@ w@@ al@@ ser@@ tal and Jun@@ gh@@ ol@@ z is only acc@@ es@@ sible to German bu@@ yers , since the only access to those areas is by road from Germany .
regulation ( EC ) No 17@@ 8@@ 2 / 2003 , however , which introduced direct payments for the da@@ ir@@ y sector , left the administration of the individual reference qu@@ ant@@ ities of the producers in question to the German authorities .
at the same time , it sti@@ pu@@ la@@ ted that the da@@ ir@@ y pre@@ mi@@ um should be paid out by the Austri@@ an authorities within the limit of their national reference qu@@ ant@@ ity and their budgetary c@@ eil@@ ing .
this resul@@ ted in a highly ir@@ ra@@ tional situation , as one might imag@@ ine .
it is essential to ad@@ minis@@ ter the da@@ ir@@ y pre@@ mi@@ um in a fair and balanced way .
it is therefore necessary to conver@@ t the German reference qu@@ ant@@ ities of the producers concerned into Austri@@ an reference qu@@ ant@@ ities as from mil@@ k quo@@ ta year 2004 / 2005 .
I voted for the proposal .
.@@ - I voted for the report because I believe it is essential that our legal instruments should be amended following the Council decision of June 2004 , so that the process may take its course and achieve all its objectives , which will only be possible - and truly effective - with the amendments suggested here by the Council .
.@@ - Per@@ hap@@ s because I am a citizen of a Member State that has bene@@ fi@@ ted and still benefits from financial instruments that promote development and cohesion within Europe and because I can see the real improvements that they have brought to my country , I believe I am in a position to understand the crucial importance of access to those instruments by the new Member States and also by candidate countries , as is the case with C@@ roati@@ a .
I therefore think it is bene@@ fic@@ ial to amen@@ d the regulations laid down under those instruments , so as to enable that country to have satisfactory access to them as part of the pre @-@ accession process on which it is embar@@ king .
even during the currency of the present financial perspective , the instruments in question ( P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E , I@@ S@@ P@@ A , SA@@ P@@ A@@ R@@ D ) will be able to contribute to structural improvements in administrative , legal and environmental terms and in the agricultural and transport sectors , preparing C@@ roati@@ a to adopt the uni@@ fied In@@ s@@ tru@@ ment for P@@ re @-@ A@@ cc@@ ession As@@ sis@@ tance ( I@@ P@@ A ) , which will be made available to it from 2007 .
.
it is crucial that statistics are reli@@ able , and for that to happen , agreements must be in place between different countries in order to ensure the val@@ id@@ ity of the data used as indic@@ ators , due to the fact that they are recognised and mu@@ tually val@@ id@@ ated .
in the particular case of the Sw@@ is@@ s Con@@ feder@@ ation , this question takes on greater importance given that country &apos;s pro@@ xim@@ ity .
.
the report before us follows up the Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Sw@@ is@@ s Con@@ feder@@ ation in the field of statistics .
as we know , relations between the EU and S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land have gro@@ wn closer over the course of the years , at economic , social and political levels .
the plan here is for those relations to extend into the area of statis@@ tical cooperation .
I , personally , fully endorse the proposal before us , which , as far as we are concerned , should have been implemented long ago .
S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land was actually a party to the agreement on the European Economic A@@ re@@ a - an agreement that covered statis@@ tical cooperation - but was unable to rati@@ fy it , because of a &apos; no &quot; vote in a national referendum on the issue in 199@@ 2 .
accord@@ ingly , following various bilateral agreements , some of which were more for@@ mal than others , it is time to draw a defin@@ itive line under the 199@@ 2 re@@ ver@@ se , and defin@@ iti@@ vely to conclude the negotiations man@@ da@@ ted in 2000 , thereby establishing a complete framework for cooperation with S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land extended to the area of statistics .
the purpose of the regulation with which the report is concerned is to emplo@@ y support measures to improve social conditions , employment and the comple@@ tion of a free @-@ trade area for the area of Europe and the Mediterranean .
a free trade area is , however , best set up through the EU &apos;s ab@@ olis@@ hing du@@ ties , subsidies and export grants .
it is up to each Member State to decide upon support measures in the form of aid and investments , without making a d@@ et@@ our via the EU budget .
the June Lis@@ t cannot therefore vote in favour of the report .
.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gar@@ gani ( ) on the proposal for a Council regulation on financial and technical measures to ac@@ company the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership ( ME@@ DA ) ( Co@@ di@@ fied ver@@ sion ) .
simp@@ lif@@ ying and clari@@ fying Community legislation are important ways to bring the institutions closer to the citizens .
the dis@@ per@@ sed nature of many provisions , and amendments there@@ to , adver@@ sel@@ y affec@@ ts the transparency needed for people to be able to understand Community texts .
co@@ di@@ fication is la@@ ud@@ able work and absolutely necessary .
Europe must be at the service of the Member States and their citizens , and , accord@@ ingly , must not produce legislative texts that are c@@ lo@@ a@@ ked in ob@@ f@@ us@@ cation .
.
I voted in favour of this new co@@ di@@ fication of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 14@@ 8@@ 8 / 9@@ 6 and subsequ@@ ent amendments there@@ to , which fully preser@@ ves the content of the co@@ di@@ fied acts .
this satis@@ f@@ ies the intention to press ahead with simp@@ lif@@ ying and clari@@ fying Community legislation , in order to make it easier for everyone to access , to understand and to implement it .
this is an area that I have always believ@@ ed to be of major importance to the EU &apos;s future : namely , making European legislative mechanisms and regulations easier to understand , ra@@ ising awareness of them and bringing them closer to Europe &apos;s citizens .
as regards this particular issue , I should also like to point out that various recent European Coun@@ c@@ ils , ( Lisbon , Cor@@ f@@ u and Es@@ sen ) have noted that the Mediterranean zone is a priority region for the EU and have adopted the aim of establishing a genuine and effective Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership .
.
I voted in favour of the proposal before us aimed at co@@ di@@ fying Dec@@ ision 7@@ 3 / 3@@ 9@@ 1 / E@@ EC and subsequ@@ ent amendments and add@@ itions there@@ to , on consultation and information procedures in matters of credit insurance , credit guarantees and financial cre@@ d@@ its .
this is merely a matter of for@@ mal amendments required by the co@@ di@@ fication process .
in this case , co@@ di@@ fication is all the more important given that the issue is of a special cross @-@ border nature .
one last thing to which I should like to draw your attention , which is consistent with the Economic and Social Committee &apos;s opinion : careful attention should be paid to the acc@@ ura@@ cy of trans@@ la@@ tions , because any in@@ acc@@ ura@@ cies could lead to legal un@@ certainty and , in turn , to incor@@ rec@@ t implementation of the text .
.
the proposal before us simply consis@@ ts of co@@ di@@ fying all existing Community legislation in this area , in order to ensure greater clar@@ ity and better understanding of the legislation .
it is important that this should be the case .
there have been many directives regula@@ ting the minimum level of cr@@ ude oil and / or pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um products .
broad@@ ly speaking , all of those directives stress the fundamental importance of such products to the Community &apos;s supply of energy products .
these products come from third countries , and a reduction in their supply might have serious effects on the European Community &apos;s economic activity .
against this back@@ dro@@ p , the proposal before us seeks to help European citizens to be aware of and to understand the rules and , more importan@@ tly , seeks to create the necessary conditions to solve any potential shor@@ ta@@ ge of this vital energy source .
I therefore voted in favour .
we believe it is those countries sit@@ u@@ ated around the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a that must deal with the issue of the future management of fishing resources in the Bal@@ tic .
we believe that the European Commun@@ ities should not have that competence .
the issue of manag@@ ing the world &apos;s fishing resources must be dealt with par@@ tly via the United Nations and , in the case of the Bal@@ tic , between the Bal@@ tic countries .
we have therefore ch@@ os@@ en to vote against this report .
.
I welcome this report fulfi@@ lling the European Parliament &apos;s requirement to ver@@ i@@ fy the cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als of its Members , ( under the terms of Article 12 of the A@@ c@@ t concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct univers@@ al su@@ ff@@ ra@@ ge , as amended by the Council decision of 25 June / 22 September 2002 ) working on an EU and Member State level .
this report highli@@ ghts the need to up@@ date the current provisions of the Rules of Procedure , making them more compatible with the new provisions of the 197@@ 6 A@@ c@@ t .
in particular , this report emphas@@ ises the need to combat certain lo@@ op@@ hol@@ es ar@@ ising in the trans@@ ition from one parliament to the next .
for example , du@@ al parliamentary mandate issues .
.
the issue before us is a Commission proposal on the future management of the fisheries resources of the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a and the Bel@@ ts .
the proposal seeks to res@@ ha@@ pe the nature of the relationship between the EU and third countries that are party to agreements concluded on the above @-@ mentioned sea areas , following the recent accession to the EU of E@@ st@@ onia , Lat@@ via , Li@@ thu@@ ania and Pol@@ and .
currently , and until December 2005 , the future management of fisheries resources of the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a and the Bel@@ ts is regula@@ ted by the 197@@ 3 agreement , concluded by the European Community , the Bal@@ tic States , Pol@@ and and Russia , known as the G@@ d@@ ans@@ k Convention .
as a direct result of their accession to the EU , the above @-@ mentioned Member States with@@ dre@@ w from the agreement .
consequently , the agreement now applies sol@@ ely between the EU and the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation .
the Commission therefore proposes the Community &apos;s with@@ dra@@ w@@ al from the agreement .
if this does not happen , relations between the EU and Russia would be regula@@ ted by an instrument created for multila@@ teral cooperation , and this might have adver@@ se consequences .
I support the rapporteur in that I welcome this proposal and , at the same time , I understand the concerns that the objectives of protecting ...
we believe that the European Convention should be granted discharge for 2003 , because there are no reasons for bringing the economic report into question .
we nonetheless op@@ pose the Convention &apos;s lack of representa@@ tiveness and un@@ democratic working methods .
among the Convention &apos;s just over one hun@@ d@@ red members , women , young people and critic@@ s of the EU were seriously under @-@ represented .
the Convention cannot therefore claim to represent the citizens of Europe .
what is more , the Convention &apos;s President , Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing , and his P@@ ra@@ es@@ id@@ ium designed policy as they themselves saw f@@ it .
proposals were introduced that have no basis in the working groups or in plenary .
no votes took place in plenary , and G@@ is@@ c@@ ard himself decided how the maj@@ orities loo@@ ked .
we share the analysis made by G@@ is@@ el@@ a S@@ tu@@ ar@@ t , a British member of the Convention &apos;s P@@ ra@@ es@@ id@@ ium , in her bo@@ o@@ k &apos; The Ma@@ king of Europe &apos;s Constitution &quot; ( F@@ ab@@ ian Soci@@ ety , 2003 ) .
in her view , the work of the Convention was s@@ hap@@ ed by an un@@ accoun@@ table political el@@ ite that had already decided the final outcome from the out@@ set .
.
given that this expenditure was val@@ id@@ ated by the Court of Auditors , which felt that it had ob@@ tained reasonable as@@ surance that the accounts for the financial year en@@ ded 31 December 2003 were reli@@ able and that the under@@ lying transa@@ ctions were , on the whole , legal and reg@@ ular , I am voting in favour of this recommendation .
.
I share the rapporteur &apos;s conclusion that , in light of the ass@@ ent given by the Council on 8 July 2004 and by the Commission on 19 October 2004 and the compliance acknowled@@ ged by the Court of Auditors on 13 May 2004 , there does not appear to be any justi@@ fication for Parliament to with@@ hold its ass@@ ent to the gran@@ ting of discharge for the financial year 2003 to the Secretary @-@ General of the Convention .
I naturally welcome the transparency and , to use the word of the Court of Auditors , the reli@@ ability , of the accounts for the financial year .
I also agree that the resid@@ ue should be ap@@ por@@ tioned between the three In@@ stitu@@ tions that contribu@@ ted to the Convention &apos;s budget .
I voted in favour .
the members of the June Lis@@ t have ch@@ os@@ en to vote against the report because the Committee on Budgets &quot; proposed changes open the way to further EU commitments , without any requirement for coordination with other international financial institutions .
the June Lis@@ t is opposed to the Commission &apos;s proposal and believes that the EI@@ B should not issue the proposed lo@@ an guarantee .
the June Lis@@ t recommen@@ ds instead that those countries that are affected by lo@@ an guarantees and that benefit from these should themselves stand as guar@@ an@@ tors of those lo@@ ans or find other pla@@ yers in the free market to do so .
according to the June Lis@@ t , the proposal is not in the Community &apos;s interest but is in danger of becoming an expen@@ sive failure if lo@@ an guarantees are given without being tes@@ ted by the market in the us@@ ual way .
the June Lis@@ t would ide@@ ally have lik@@ ed to have seen the Commission &apos;s proposal too rejected in the vote but , ir@@ on@@ ically , fin@@ ds the Commission &apos;s original proposal less objec@@ tion@@ able than the one presented by the Committee on Budgets .
.
on the proposal for a Council decision gran@@ ting a Community guarantee to the European In@@ ves@@ tment Bank against los@@ ses under lo@@ ans for certain types of projects in Russia and the W@@ estern New In@@ dependent States ( W@@ N@@ I@@ S ) .
the EU &apos;s external policy is , in this case , expressed through a &apos; N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy , &quot; which will enable those countries to continue on the path to economic , social and political development .
it strik@@ es me as important to point out that the EU &apos;s external len@@ ding capacity is an important foreign policy development instrument and , in turn , a power@@ ful too@@ l in the overall capacity of the EU to contribute to development and security in our immediate neighbour@@ ho@@ od .
.
I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision before us , which fall@@ s within the scope of the Commission &apos;s communication of March 2003 entitled &apos; W@@ id@@ er Europe - N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od : a new framework for relations with our eas@@ tern and sou@@ thern neighbours , &quot; which laid down a strategy for creating a &apos; cir@@ cle of friends &quot; - an area of shared values , stability and prosperity , and one in which it is possible to achieve deep@@ er economic integration .
I welcome the approach that the decision is to cover the activity of the EI@@ B &apos;s lo@@ ans until the end of January 2007 , ear@@ mar@@ ked for areas such as the environment , transport , tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ications and energy infrastructure .
a further reason to welcome this proposal is that it is du@@ ly consistent with the EU @-@ Russia Summit held in the H@@ ag@@ ue on 25 November 2004 , aimed at promoting strategic part@@ ner@@ ships and deep@@ ening what are referred to as the &apos; F@@ our Common S@@ pac@@ es , &quot; namely , a common economic space ; a common space of freedom , security and justice ; a common space in the field of external security ; and a common space of research , education and culture .
.
the issue before us is the third read@@ mission agreement between the European Community and a third country , which forms part of the so @-@ called &apos; fight against illegal immigration . &quot;
the rapporteur points out , and I quo@@ te , that &apos; negotiations of read@@ mission agreements are moving forward with difficul@@ ty , in particular because of the problems the European Union has in offer@@ ing anything in exchange for the agreements . &quot;
this essentially bo@@ ils down to ex@@ pe@@ lling all workers , who , eag@@ er for a new life , em@@ i@@ gra@@ te to another country , but who find themselves faced with human resources &apos; management , &quot; which si@@ f@@ ts them and remo@@ ves those it de@@ em@@ s sur@@ plu@@ s to requirements , and this is something that we have repe@@ a@@ tedly condem@@ ned .
this process forms part of a ten@@ d@@ ency towards &apos; glob@@ ally &quot; explo@@ iting the work@@ force , and these agreements are no more than one of the visi@@ ble fac@@ es of that ten@@ d@@ ency .
hence our vote against .
the read@@ mission agreement with S@@ ri Lan@@ ka is part and par@@ c@@ el of the introduction of a common immigration policy .
the June Lis@@ t does not , however , wish to contribute to any For@@ t@@ ress Europe .
measures concerning illegal immigration and resid@@ ence , including the re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ation of illegal immigrants , should be an issue for the Member States &quot; national parliaments .
consequently , we are voting against the report .
.
agreements of this kind , which have been signed with various countries , are of major importance in the fight against illegal immigration .
they are also concerned with safe@@ guar@@ ding respect for human rights , given that we must remain vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant to ensure that the law is being stric@@ tly compli@@ ed with .
I am therefore in favour of their adoption .
.
on the subject of the management of mi@@ gra@@ tory flo@@ ws , based on the Amster@@ dam Treaty , the Tamper@@ e Summit called for &apos; assistance to countries of origin and tr@@ ansi@@ t to be developed in order to promote voluntary return as well as to help the authorities of those countries to strengthen their ability to combat effectively trafficking in human beings and to c@@ ope with their read@@ mission obligations towards the Union and the Member States &quot; ( I@@ V@@ .@@ 2@@ 6@@ . ) .
the purpose of the proposal for a decision before us is to regula@@ te the conditions under which the EU and the S@@ ri Lan@@ kan authorities will read@@ mit people who do not have legal resid@@ ence in each other &apos;s territory , a practice that the Community would like to see included in all future agreements with third countries ; and rightly so in my view .
no@@ t@@ with@@ standing the need for strict controls on access to the Community area , which must be kept up , I share the Foreign Affairs Committee &apos;s desire to ensure that the need to respect human rights is never over@@ loo@@ ked .
I voted in favour .
.
the Commission did not manage to obtain a unanim@@ ous decision in the Council on its proposal for a directive on simp@@ lif@@ ying and stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ing reduced V@@ A@@ T rates .
consequently , the period of application of Directive 1999 / 8@@ 5 / EU , author@@ ising Member States to apply , on an exper@@ imen@@ tal basis , a reduced V@@ A@@ T rate on labour @-@ inten@@ sive services , has been repe@@ a@@ tedly extended , and now comes to an end on 31 December 2005 .
the purpose of this rec@@ as@@ ting of the Directive is to make it possible for the new Member States , following enlargement , to apply it , and this is something that we welcome .
whilst the Commission &apos;s assessment report says that the effects of this measure are ne@@ g@@ li@@ gible and that the cost / benefit rati@@ o is un@@ fav@@ ourable , the Commission &apos;s main objective re@@ vol@@ ves around the difficul@@ ty of harmon@@ ising V@@ A@@ T , although it does state that this measure does not pre@@ jud@@ ice the rules of the internal market .
although we have certain reser@@ vations about this measure , and taking account of the fact that the measure will not solve the problems of high unemployment in the EU , we feel that this author@@ isation should be maintained for Member States that wish to apply it perman@@ ently .
this will contribute further towards creating jobs and towards combating the par@@ all@@ el economy .
we hope that the new Member States will make their contribution towards achieving this aim .
.
the adoption by the Council , on 22 October 1999 , of Directive 1999 / 8@@ 5 / EC amen@@ ding Directive 7@@ 7 / 8@@ 8 / E@@ EC , was intended to fos@@ ter the exper@@ imen@@ tal scheme of reduced V@@ A@@ T rates for labour inten@@ sive services , thereby enab@@ ling those Member States wis@@ hing to do so to test the effects of reduced V@@ A@@ T on those sectors in terms of creating jobs and combating the par@@ all@@ el economy .
the exper@@ im@@ ent was even@@ tually the subject of an assessment report that re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that it is not possible to establish a direct cor@@ relation between reducing V@@ A@@ T rates and combating unemployment and the par@@ all@@ el economy .
reducing V@@ A@@ T rates does not strik@@ e me as the best or most appropriate way of bo@@ os@@ ting the labour market and reducing the par@@ all@@ el economy .
given that nothing , however , was laid down - the exper@@ im@@ ent was due to fin@@ ish defin@@ iti@@ vely on 31 December 2003 - regarding the possibility of the new Member States applying reduced rates , the situation had become un@@ fair .
as I feel that the new Member States should be entitled to the same opportunity , I voted in favour .
.
I am delighted to indic@@ ate my support for this Re@@ port and for the extension of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E Programme .
this programme has made an original and essential contribution to re@@ conciliation , re@@ building trust between neighbours and bringing communities together from both sides of the border .
the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E projects have contribu@@ ted gre@@ atly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations and I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 .
there is not doubt that our hop@@ es for a peaceful future depen@@ d on the good work of the various cross @-@ border and North @-@ South initiatives fun@@ ded under this programme .
we have voted against this report .
we believe that those Member States that wish to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland must do so by decid@@ ing in their respec@@ tive national parliaments to give such contributions .
the Member States must fund these contributions directly out of their respec@@ tive state bud@@ gets , and the money should not need to take a d@@ et@@ our via the EU budget .
.
on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( 2005 @-@ 2006 ) .
this fund still has major importance in re@@ building areas de@@ vasta@@ ted by the ins@@ tability caused by dec@@ ad@@ es of terrorism .
its objectives continue to be pres@@ sing objectives and at this historic time of negotiations on las@@ ting peace , the EU must show solidarity with the Irish people .
.
the International Fund for Ireland , which was set up in 198@@ 6 , with the aim of helping to implement the Ang@@ l@@ o @-@ Irish Agreement , of promoting economic and social advan@@ ces and of encouraging contact , dialogue and re@@ conciliation between nation@@ alists and union@@ ists throughout Ireland , has done extremely useful and positive work in promoting economic and social development towards peace and re@@ conciliation in the region .
the process of consolid@@ ating peace in Nor@@ thern Ireland and in the Irish border region is now , once again , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by thre@@ ats and un@@ certainty .
indeed , the Nor@@ thern Ireland Assembly has been suspen@@ ded .
against this back@@ dro@@ p , the promotion of peace through economic and social development in the regions of both parts of Ireland takes on ex@@ tra signific@@ ance .
it is a process that , at gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots level , has been carried out in ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary fas@@ hi@@ on by the International Fund for Ireland .
I therefore feel that the Commission should adopt the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland .
I am , consequently , voting in favour .
.
a key element in the running of a representative democratic institution is compliance with the principles govern@@ ing - appropri@@ ately - the rules of parliamentary im@@ munity .
consequently , the decision to wa@@ i@@ ve the parliamentary im@@ munity of a Member of this House must be gre@@ e@@ ted with due cau@@ tion .
the case before us concerns the judicial process relating to behaviour that be@@ ars no relation to political activity .
accord@@ ingly , and given the content of the report , I voted in favour .
.
this is a sensible arrang@@ ement for the bilateral management of the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a fisher@@ y resources , integra@@ ting the existing bilateral agreements between the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation and E@@ st@@ onia , Fin@@ land , Lat@@ via , Li@@ thu@@ ania , Pol@@ and and Sweden within a single bilateral agreement .
of course it is important place a high priority on maintaining stocks of fish .
it should also be kept in mind that the greatest threat to living resources in the Bal@@ tic Se@@ a comes from land and not from the sea , and the best way to limit the pollution of the sea is to integra@@ te environmental protection requirements into the fisheries policy .
this aspect should be one of the top priorities while negotiating a bilateral agreement with the Community and the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation .
.
the issue before us is the creation of an instrument to facilitate the &apos; mobility &quot; of workers in Europe and , in the rapporteur &apos;s words , &apos; to help achieve the Lisbon 2000 strategic objectives . &quot;
as we have said before , the key question here is the purpose of such an instrument ; will it serve to reg@@ ener@@ ate a country &apos;s human resources or will it merely help the most econom@@ ically developed countries to explo@@ it other countries &quot; human resources , by increasing workers &quot; &apos; mobility &quot; ?
we fear , and with good reason , that it will serve to raise the number of technical or scientific staff em@@ i@@ gra@@ ting to the most econom@@ ically developed countries , and that , to this end , the aim is to create a European labour market , or even a European &apos; sto@@ ck exchange &quot; of speci@@ alised staff .
let me state , once again , that the proposed documents already exist as a result of cooperation with the Council and / or UN@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O .
hence our vote in favour , al@@ be@@ it with critic@@ isms of the attemp@@ ts to con@@ ta@@ min@@ ate appar@@ ently positive aims .
we do not believe it necessary for the EU to create a standard document por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o that EU citizens will be able to use in job appl@@ ications .
the EU institutions can , of course , have a standard document por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o for those seeking employment with these institutions .
such a document por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o should not , however , be turned into a com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y standard requirement .
instead , this is an area in which the Member States themselves must be able to take decisions .
.
I congratulate Mrs N@@ o@@ va@@ k on her excellent work on the establishment of a single Community framework for the transparency of quali@@ fications and competences - Euro@@ pass .
the aim of this proposal is to create a uni@@ form &apos; por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o &quot; of documents that will enable citizens applying for a job or a course of study to set out their personal quali@@ fications in a manner that is compar@@ able throughout the EU .
Euro@@ pass will facilitate professional mobility and encourage learning in Europe , and this will help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy .
I endorse the creation of Euro@@ pass because mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in reducing the s@@ ki@@ lls short@@ fall in the European labour market .
I am convinced that it will provide the necessary im@@ pe@@ tus to break down the bar@@ riers that European citizens come up against in this field .
I should also like to under@@ line the need to avoid pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ing the legislative process , and therefore voted in favour of Euro@@ pass , which will enable it to enter into force as early as January 2005 .
.
in line with the aim of greater coordination , stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ing and transparency of quali@@ fications and s@@ ki@@ lls , we must promote the integration of measures in the area of the cer@@ ti@@ fication of quali@@ fications into a single framework .
this is not an issue of recogn@@ ising diplom@@ as , but of simp@@ lif@@ ying the processes for setting out quali@@ fications and s@@ ki@@ lls .
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation .
.
the legislative proposal before us aims to create a single &apos; por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o &quot; of documents , which will enable citizens to set out their ab@@ il@@ ities , s@@ ki@@ lls and quali@@ fications and will facilitate the recognition in the labour market of training cour@@ ses and work experience undertaken ab@@ road .
it will therefore fos@@ ter professional and edu@@ ca@@ tional mobility in Europe .
in addition to making quali@@ fications and s@@ ki@@ lls compar@@ able , the proposal before us also help@@ s to achieve the Lisbon 2000 objectives , to turn Europe into the &apos; most dyna@@ mic and competitive area in the world &quot; by 2010 .
accord@@ ingly , Euro@@ pass - which comp@@ ris@@ es documents referring to training cour@@ ses in different countries , to higher education , to knowledge of languages and to professional training - will make a major contribution not only to these objectives , but also to an increase in the quality of general and professional education in Europe .
this is a welcome and highly important measure for young people .
as such , it must enter into force at the earli@@ est opportunity .
I voted in favour .
. - The Euro@@ pass is yet another le@@ ver to re@@ place syste@@ matic and integrated education with fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted s@@ ki@@ lls and out@@ da@@ ted training adap@@ ted to current market demands , in the aim of explo@@ iting workers and in full harmonisation with the Lisbon strategy .
it makes emplo@@ yers alone responsible for the evaluation of edu@@ ca@@ tional and vo@@ ca@@ tional quali@@ fications , so that they can sel@@ ec@@ t the most &apos; conven@@ i@@ ent &apos; work@@ er for their explo@@ ita@@ tive requirements , de@@ pri@@ ving the education system of this role .
the Euro@@ pass is open to renew@@ al and the inclu@@ sion of more new demands by emplo@@ yers ; it will also ten@@ d to be conver@@ ted into a too@@ l for keeping recor@@ ds on workers , with descri@@ p@@ tions not only of their s@@ ki@@ lls and knowledge , but also of their views , per@@ su@@ asi@@ ons and conduct .
talk of facilita@@ ting edu@@ ca@@ tional and professional mobility is a smo@@ ke s@@ cre@@ en .
the policy of &apos; lif@@ el@@ ong learning &apos; and of inter@@ chan@@ ge@@ able individual training mod@@ ules ob@@ struc@@ ts rather than facilita@@ tes mobility and mar@@ ks &apos; the absolu@@ te availa@@ bility of man to the alter@@ n@@ ating demands of labour &apos; .
we call for the Euro@@ pass to be ab@@ olis@@ hed and for the adoption of : 1 ) a single , free , state education system which will create an integrated edu@@ ca@@ tional foun@@ d@@ ation and fundamental vo@@ ca@@ tional training which will result in full professional suffici@@ ency and 2 ) a high standard of living and equal employment , education and living conditions for workers on the move .

.
Mr President , despite the te@@ mp@@ tation every year to try to fund Parliament &apos;s interests and bla@@ me the Council for everything else , I believe we are pres@@ enting a good agreement today .
the annual budgetary procedure is a perfec@@ t example of how inter@@ institutional cooperation should be .
I have been a member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years and I have never believ@@ ed that inter@@ institutional conf@@ ron@@ tation is the right way to resolve budgetary priorities .
I believe that time has prov@@ en those of us who pre@@ fer agreement to be right .
the best conclusion for this 2005 draft budget would be for the three institutions to be moder@@ ately satisfied with the final result .
it would be rid@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous to present this agreement as a vic@@ tory for one institution over another , because I believe that Europe is made up of the three institutions .
it has been a very compl@@ icated year from a budgetary point of view .
we beg@@ an with a reduction in the c@@ eil@@ ings for categ@@ or@@ ies 3 , 4 and 5 , which has made it very difficult to comply with this Parliament &apos;s priorities .
the Member States have applied budgetary ri@@ g@@ our , as a consequ@@ ence of the Stability Pact , and that must continue in the future .
we have had European elections : new MEPs , a new Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets , who has worked very well and I congratulate him on that ; a new Commission and a new Commissioner , who has also worked very well and I congratulate her on that as well , and I also congratulate former Commissioner Schre@@ yer .
ladies and gentlemen , since September of this year , I have been advoc@@ ating the following budgetary strategy : to defend the European Parliament &apos;s priorities with regard to the Lisbon objectives , information policy and the areas of security and justice .
we defend these priorities because we are a political Parliament and we have promis@@ ed our citizens a Europe with economic growth , job creation , better information on the present and the future of the Union , better control of mi@@ gra@@ tory flo@@ ws and greater security against crime and terrorism .
our contribution to the creation of a genuine Community response to terrorism is this Parliament &apos;s best possible tribu@@ te to the almost 200 Europeans mur@@ der@@ ed in Mad@@ rid on 11 March .
I would like to thank all of you for your support .
it was fundamental to our strategy that the European agencies should not be fun@@ ded unila@@ ter@@ ally , at the expen@@ se of Parliament &apos;s other priorities .
if we want more agencies , we must provide new resources .
that was our position and I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that this Parliament has achieved almost 100 % of the strategy we established .
we have managed to mo@@ bil@@ ise the flexibility instrument in the su@@ m of EUR 18@@ 5 million and this is a new res@@ ource , which is greater than the c@@ eil@@ ing of the financial perspec@@ tives .
and with these new resources we have fun@@ ded EUR 40 million of the dec@@ entr@@ alised agencies , which means that , for the first time , the Council recogn@@ ises the need to provide new resources to comply with the new commitments .
we have also used EUR 100 million from the flexibility instrument to fund the reconstruction of Iraq , thereby lea@@ ving sufficient budgetary mar@@ gin to fund Latin America , Asia , the Mediterranean policy , the fight against disease and poverty and the democracy and human rights initiative , amongst other things .
we are still concerned about the issue of payments , despite the fact that we have a statement by the three institutions on the commitment to present an amen@@ ding budget in 2005 if necessary .
the ri@@ g@@ our and a@@ us@@ ter@@ ity we all apply - the three institutions - is one thing , but the in@@ discrimin@@ ate sa@@ ving of payment appropriations , which could je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e budgetary execu@@ tion in 2005 , is quite another .
this Parliament will be particularly vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant next year .
budgetary sa@@ v@@ ings should never be at the expen@@ se of the Union &apos;s needs .
the Council has cut payments in agriculture by EUR 1 billion , which , from a budgetary point of view , is un@@ us@@ ual , and we a@@ wait further explan@@ ations from the Council .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , we thank the Dutch Presidency for its p@@ ra@@ g@@ mat@@ ism in the negoti@@ ation , which we expected , and its great willingness to reach consensus with Parliament , which has been a surpris@@ e .
in any event , thank you , Minister , for the role you have played ; thank you , Commissioner , for your medi@@ ation .
I hope to cooperate closely with you during 2005 .
thank you to the coordin@@ ators , the MEPs , the members of the Budgets sec@@ re@@ tari@@ at and my own personal assis@@ tant .
it has been a ple@@ asure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget , which I hope can be voted for on Th@@ urs@@ day without too many problems .
Mr President , administrative expenditure has not of course been the most difficult aspect of this year &apos;s budget negotiations , especially since employees &quot; sal@@ ary increas@@ es were clearly to remain bel@@ ow 1 % this year instead of 2@@ .@@ 6 % , as orig@@ in@@ ally for@@ eseen .
with the figures from Parliament &apos;s first reading , there is thus a su@@ itable mar@@ gin bel@@ ow the c@@ eil@@ ing for administrative expenditure .
to this , we can add that certain institutions have been able to ex@@ pe@@ d@@ ite their payments this year and have thus brought about the possibility of sa@@ v@@ ings on the 2005 budget .
all in all , it has therefore been success@@ fully en@@ su@@ red that the other institutions - that is to say , apart from Parliament and the Council , the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regi@@ ons , the European Ombudsman and the European D@@ ata Pro@@ te@@ ction Su@@ per@@ vis@@ or - are able to make the planned staff ap@@ poin@@ tments resul@@ ting from enlargement , sta@@ ff@@ ing reforms and the reform of financial administration .
in practice , the sa@@ v@@ ings due to the lower sal@@ ary increas@@ es will now be implemented with the help of an amen@@ ding budget in the course of 2005 .
it was that agreement into which we ente@@ red with the Council .
we are not therefore voting on these sa@@ v@@ ings at Parliament &apos;s second reading but , by making sa@@ v@@ ings by means of a second amen@@ ding budget , we are also making sa@@ v@@ ings on the Council &apos;s and Parliament &apos;s bud@@ gets , which have of course been drawn up in the light of the conciliation ente@@ red into with the Council at first reading .
so far , so good .
it is important for all the institutions continu@@ ally to ensure that the administration is as efficient and in@@ expen@@ sive as possible .
it is especially important , moreover , that we obtain financial ga@@ ins through cooperation between the institutions .
that is also why I think it important that , early next year - and before 1 April - we obtain an up@@ da@@ ted report from the sec@@ re@@ ta@@ ries @-@ general on how the ap@@ poin@@ tments are going .
we have seen the dela@@ ys there have been in rec@@ ru@@ iting staff following enlargement , and I think it important that we closely follow up how these matters are proceed@@ ing so that we might see if there are likely to be problems .
in other areas , too , there is a real need for the institutions to cooperate in their deliber@@ ations .
I should like at this point to restric@@ t the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliament &apos;s lead@@ ership .
one practical example is the Committee of the Regi@@ ons &quot; desire to be able to use Parliament &apos;s meeting ro@@ oms in Brussels for its meetings .
it makes good sense for us to make facil@@ ities available as long as , by doing so , we are not inter@@ fer@@ ing with Parliament &apos;s working arrangements .
that is a decision that Parliament &apos;s lead@@ ership must make .
it must be a decision that f@@ its in with our work , but also one that is re@@ mun@@ er@@ ative .
Parliament &apos;s budget stands at 20 % of administrative expenditure and appears reasonable in relation to needs .
I would , however , emphasise - as I have done in the past - that in recent years we have been able to de@@ plo@@ y major expenditure on pa@@ ying for buil@@ dings under this 20 % budget , and we shall thus sa@@ ve on r@@ ent in the bud@@ gets for the next few years .
this will also happen in the current year when more than EUR 1@@ 30 million will be paid out on the two new buil@@ dings - D@@ 4 and D@@ 5 - in Brussels .
when all is said and done , there will be some room for man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re in Parliament &apos;s budget for 2005 , and I would therefore call upon Parliament &apos;s leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs , for example regarding trans@@ lation and legal assistance .
we often have to make compromis@@ es , including ones that are perhaps not always satisfactory , for example on the l@@ ing@@ uis@@ tic fron@@ t .
with enlargement and increasing legislative activity , we need access to advice , as well as to studies , consul@@ tations and analys@@ es .
it is now Parliament that is people &apos;s w@@ in@@ dow on@@ to joint legislation , and we must therefore demand conditions that ensure we can do legislative work of the proper quality .
the 2005 budget appropri@@ ates EUR 17@@ .@@ 5 million to an increase in MEPs &quot; re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the purpose of ap@@ poin@@ ting staff .
MEPs are experienc@@ ing an increasing burden of work as a result not only of the increasing legislative work but also of enlargement .
the legislation on which we work is very often techn@@ ically compl@@ icated environmental and commercial legislation , and we therefore require support in our work .
that is why it is also only fair that MEPs be given higher re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation so that we can ap@@ point staff and , equally to the point , do so under reasonable working conditions .
the amount concerned has been placed in reser@@ ve while we a@@ wa@@ ited a decision .
the decision has now been made ; clear rules in a number of areas have been adopted ; and the Committee on Budgets will thus be able next year to adopt a position on remo@@ ving the reser@@ ve in the light of a request by Parliament &apos;s President .
finally , I should like to say thank you for your constructive cooperation on this budget procedure .
I would particularly thank Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ ite , our Commissioner , who was very active in bringing about a compromise on the budget .
I would also thank the Council &apos;s negoti@@ a@@ tor , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , and the rapporteur , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , who I think have made f@@ anta@@ s@@ tic contributions to the budget procedure .
last but not least , I would thank my colleagues , the coordin@@ ators , for their constructive cooperation on the budget .
. Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this year &apos;s mo@@ bil@@ isation of the flexibility instrument is closely connec@@ ted with the success of the Budget consul@@ tations and the agreement that we concluded - as we indeed needed to - between the institutions .
let me say , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , in re@@ tro@@ s@@ pect , how good it is that at that time , in 1999 , Parliament secu@@ red this flexibility instrument following la@@ bor@@ ious negotiations , for it has been very much to the benefit of the Council &apos;s priorities when implementing past years &quot; Budgets .
let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument , the annual up@@ per limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EUR 200 million , is intended to deal with unfor@@ eseen even@@ tu@@ alities , and also that head@@ ing 24 of the Inter@@ institutional Agreement states that , as a rule , this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two succ@@ es@@ sive financial years .
before this flexibility instrument is made use of , there does of course have to be a motion to that effect , and there has to be examin@@ ation of whether new unfor@@ eseen measures are to be fun@@ ded within a head@@ ing or , where this is impossible , by shi@@ f@@ ts between one head@@ ing and another , which is to be followed by discussion of whether the flexibility instrument is to be applied .
we go through this procedure almost every year , and what we have actually lear@@ ned from the experience is that the interpre@@ tation put on this flexibility has sometimes placed it under some considerable stra@@ in .
I would draw attention to this year &apos;s result , which is that we have EUR 18@@ 5 million at our dispos@@ al , EUR 45 million for the Pe@@ ace II programme , EUR 40 million for the agencies - which are obviously among the Council &apos;s really important priorities and are always threa@@ tening to dis@@ place important programmes in head@@ ing I@@ II , which y@@ iel@@ d added value for Europe - and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq .
it is with specific reference to this that I want to point out that , in the current 2004 Budget , out of a total of EUR 90 million for Iraq , EUR 7@@ 4 million have - as I rec@@ all - already been fun@@ ded in 2004 with the aid of the flexibility instrument .
that man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tly borders on the inde@@ f@@ en@@ sible . as a rule , that should not be done .
for that reason , I believe we would be very well advis@@ ed , in the debate on the new Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive and the flexibility it calls for , to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibility instrument over the past years .
let me take this opportunity to say that we are talking here , overall , in terms of payments from the 2005 Budget of EUR 10@@ 6@@ .@@ 3 billion and EUR 200 million allowed for flexibility .
what is interesting about this year is that , for the first time , not only does head@@ ing I@@ V - foreign policy - benefit from the use of the flexibility instrument , but also head@@ ings II and I@@ II necess@@ arily benefit from what we have negoti@@ ated .
the ultima@@ te result of this , and what might be called an additional result , is that the Agreement has also made it possible - in a sort of legal / budgetary emergency operation - to incorpor@@ ate EUR 1@@ 20 million worth of funding for Nor@@ thern Cyprus under head@@ ing V@@ II and to add EUR 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy , bringing it up to EUR 6@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million .
.
Mr President , I am pleased that our two institutions reached a global agreement on the budget of the Union for next year during the conciliation meeting on 25 November .
following your deliber@@ ations today , allow me to make a few remarks in this context .
as you know , the Council had not initi@@ ally for@@ eseen the use of the flexibility instrument .
in our global compromise the Council had to accept its use for a substantial amount - EUR 18@@ 5 million - and this was not gre@@ e@@ ted with en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m by all Member States .
because of budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , the Council is of the opinion that cho@@ ices have to be made , just as , at national level , one cannot simply add up all priorities and expect the b@@ ill to be paid .
having said that , in prepar@@ ation for the conciliation meeting , the Council lis@@ tened carefully to Parliament &apos;s arguments .
Parliament made it clear from the start that it would not be able to finance its traditional priorities and its new priorities in He@@ ad@@ ings 3 and 4 , Internal and External Pol@@ ic@@ ies , under the existing c@@ eil@@ ings .
with the agreements on the use of the flexibility instrument in He@@ ading 3 , Parliament is in the position to restor@@ e the funding for the agencies .
at the same time Parliament has secu@@ red sufficient funding for its priorities .
as regards the use of the flexibility instrument in He@@ ading 4 , I can agree with the draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion of Parliament &apos;s Committee on Foreign Affairs that the outcome can be seen as quite positive for Parliament .
I also want to mention the peace process in Nor@@ thern Ireland .
I am pleased that we were able to agree on the financing of the Pe@@ ace II programme for 2005 @-@ 0@@ 6 .
we are making a valuable contribution to a long @-@ term solution .
finally , the Parliament &apos;s delegation made it possible to reach agreement by moder@@ ating the demands on payment appropriations .
we have a balanced result , which the Commission says is wor@@ ka@@ ble .
I look forward to the sig@@ ning cer@@ em@@ on@@ y on Th@@ urs@@ day .
.
Mr President , I am very pleased to speak to you today , the first en@@ counter for the new Commission in this very important exercise , starting on 22 November , which directly concerns the negotiations on the 2005 budget : a very important issue for Parliament and for Europe .
after fair@@ ly tou@@ gh negotiations on 25 November , when both b@@ ran@@ ches of the budgetary authority show@@ ed s@@ k@@ ill and flexibility , we reached a final agreement on a ti@@ ght budget for 2005 .
Parliament &apos;s solidarity and determination allowed it to achieve all the important goals it had set itself .
the Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Le@@ wan@@ do@@ w@@ s@@ ki ; the budget rapporteur , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o ; Mrs J@@ en@@ sen , the rapporteur on the flexibility instrument ; Mr B@@ ö@@ ge , and other members of the Committee on Budgets who partici@@ pa@@ ted very closely in all @-@ day and all @-@ night negotiations deser@@ ve thanks from all of us for the hard @-@ w@@ on results .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , also deser@@ ves our p@@ raise for having encoura@@ ged Member States to accept the agreement : not an easy task .
in the final agreement there will , of course , be some risk that not all com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y expenditure is covered in what was decided in the package .
according to up@@ da@@ ted estima@@ tes from the Committee on Agriculture , for example , some expenditure was ig@@ no@@ red by the Council : ex@@ tra calls for payments for the structural funds or actions during the year could be necessary .
but I am satisfied that we agreed a joint declaration on payment appropriations for structural actions that can allow a rapid single @-@ reading decision on a possible amen@@ ding budget for ex@@ tra payments if the Commission identi@@ f@@ ies the need in mid @-@ 2005 .
I call on both budgetary authorities to re@@ act quickly if there appears to be a need to propose this .
the same will also apply to com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y expenditure on agriculture .
we also want to emphasise that , as mentioned before , for the first time the flexibility instrument is being used above the c@@ eil@@ ings in three head@@ ings and we agreed to use the total amount of EUR 18@@ 5 million for this instrument .
I am not going to emphasise the details of the overall package , which has been very well described , or the main agreements we reached .
I would like to draw attention to what is important for us and is always important for Parliament , namely improving deli@@ very .
each year Parliament seeks to use the budget process to support the Commission &apos;s efforts to improve deli@@ very , which we are happy to accept .
the Commission &apos;s letter on impl@@ em@@ enta@@ bility has the same inten@@ t .
we have fulfi@@ lled the request made at first reading and you consequently rele@@ ased many of the reser@@ ves .
I thank you for that .
Parliament is concerned about the way non @-@ state ac@@ tors and international organisations are using European Union funds .
the Commission will produce a report by April 2005 examin@@ ing these issues .
you have maintained a reser@@ ve for the financing of 50 new pos@@ ts from the several hun@@ d@@ red requested .
I hope to introduce a transfer request in January to li@@ ft the reser@@ ve on these pos@@ ts , since I believe the conditions have been fulfi@@ lled .
you ask for the rules to be changed on the financial regulation .
I under@@ take that the Commission will bring forward proposals to modi@@ fy the financial regulation by s@@ pring 2005 , and the Commission has already introduced proposals to modi@@ fy the implementing rules .
the Council is ready to give its opinion . we a@@ wait Parliament &apos;s views .
I will look again at your request for support for events and pil@@ ot actions .
not all of them are fe@@ asi@@ ble , but the new political situation may provide new open@@ ings and I will commun@@ icate my thou@@ ghts on that to you in January .
the Commission thanks you once again for your fair and firm negotiations and for your willingness to seek a compromise .
I congratulate you all on the great success that you have achieved .
I take this opportunity to wish you the compl@@ im@@ ents of the se@@ as@@ on and look forward to the final vote on Th@@ urs@@ day .
I thank the Commissioner and would like to take this opportunity to wish her all the best in her work as part of the Commission .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the creation of a real European area of freedom , security and justice quite clearly constitu@@ tes one of the fundamental political priorities of the European Union and a major pre@@ occu@@ pation for all European citizens .
this is why I wish first of all to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets , and in particular our general rapporteur , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , for supporting and putting to the vote in this House most of the amendments submitted by the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs .
of these , several are aimed specifically at strengthening the European Union &apos;s capacity to combat terrorism .
this involves , , an increase in Euro@@ just &apos;s operating appropriations and the inclu@@ sion of a pil@@ ot project in the budget intended to enhan@@ ce coordination , throughout the EU , of the resources and activities for preventing and combating terrorist thre@@ ats .
we have also proposed measures to strengthen the ways in which all Europeans show solidarity with the victims of terrorist acts .
of the other priorities , I should like once again to highlight two of them , which are in our view of particular signific@@ ance .
we propose , Commissioner , to hold in reser@@ ve the b@@ ul@@ k of the appropriations requested on passengers &quot; rights .
we are aware of the dis@@ agreement between Parliament and the Commission as regards the level of protection for the personal data that the airlines have to provide to the American custom@@ s authorities .
if we vote for the proposed amendment , the appropriations will remain fro@@ z@@ en for as long as the Commission fail@@ s to propose an active rather than pas@@ sive system for the trans@@ mission of data , as it has undertaken to do several times and as Parliament has asked it to do .
secondly , and I particularly address these remarks to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , we propose to hold in reser@@ ve all of the appropriations ear@@ mar@@ ked for the External B@@ orders Agency .
in order to be operational and effective , Mr President , this Agency needs head@@ quar@@ ters - permanent head@@ quar@@ ters .
we ask the Council to establish such head@@ quar@@ ters urg@@ ently and prefer@@ ably before the end of this year .
Mr President , you have already sett@@ led many problems and I think you are capable of sett@@ ling this one before lea@@ ving office .
thank you in advan@@ ce .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking our three rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done , in which I also include the Cha@@ irman of our Committee and , of course , the staff of the Committee &apos;s sec@@ re@@ tari@@ at , who have provided us Members with the information we needed to stand our ground against a sh@@ re@@ w@@ d Council .
our negotiations , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , have of course left an after@@ tas@@ te , and about that I would like to speak in very pla@@ in terms .
it goes without saying that the European Union needs to sa@@ ve money .
we have to draw up a ti@@ ght budget , and we have to be responsible in our hand@@ ling of the money that the public have paid in tax , but the question form@@ ing itself in my mind is whether it is one of the tasks of the annual Budget procedure to put forward ever more re@@ cond@@ ite proposals for a Budget when you know already that there will be a suppl@@ ementary Budget next year ?
such is not a credi@@ ble approach .
in n@@ one of the 25 Member States - let me make this ab@@ und@@ antly clear - would the national parliament toler@@ ate such a way of going about things .
secondly , I ask you to try to re@@ in in your fellow ministers in the foreign affairs de@@ part@@ ments and in all the other speci@@ alis@@ ms .
I am anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating the negotiations to which Mr B@@ ö@@ ge has referred when I say that there is no ple@@ asure in la@@ ying down up@@ per limits by way of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive when it is appar@@ ent to everyone involved that the figures are no@@ tional and will never - it is to be hop@@ ed - be reached .
there I would ask you to be more hon@@ est .
almost EUR 5 billion separ@@ ates us from the up@@ per limit of Agenda 2000 - in the wrong direction !
so please let us , when considering agricultural policy , talk about how much money we really need , rather than - as the Commissioner has just said that she will need a suppl@@ ementary and amen@@ ding Budget - la@@ ying down the amounts via the Budget procedure .
let us not promis@@ e ourselves anything where the ten new countries are concerned , and then , if we want the 1.@@ 0 % Budget that we ob@@ s@@ ess about , we will be able to sa@@ ve .
that is not only what I ask for , but also the less@@ on that I have lear@@ ned from these negotiations .
although we have achieved much together , all these negotiations now need to be addressed with a bit more seri@@ ous@@ ness .
.
Commissioner , Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , it is now my turn to thank all those involved in the budget on which we shall be voting in two days &quot; time : Mrs J@@ en@@ sen , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a , Mr B@@ ö@@ ge and also all those who have been working with us .
once again , I wish to express how b@@ aff@@ led I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially , for this second reading , at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November .
it is true that we have reached an agreement and achieved results , but did it really need t@@ wel@@ ve hours to arri@@ ve at what should have been achi@@ e@@ va@@ ble by means of real methods of dialogue rather than a set of people who did real damage to the content of the budget ?
we have now reached payment appropriations of 1.@@ 0@@ 5 % of G@@ DP , which is above the mil@@ es@@ t@@ one of 1 % .
in return , however , we have ob@@ tained an un@@ hop@@ ed @-@ for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on He@@ ading 2 .
we actually feel that ob@@ tain@@ ing this result was extremely important , al@@ be@@ it highly un@@ satisfactory in the long run .
at a time when we are negotiating the next financial perspec@@ tives , we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European policies and the Council &apos;s re@@ tic@@ ence during these negotiations lead@@ s me to believe that , if we speak of a c@@ eil@@ ing in the negotiations , Parliament should also provide for the concept of a floor bene@@ ath which a European budget makes no sense .
setting payment appropriations in st@@ one while moving away from commitment appropriations is a us@@ ual strategy of the Council , but this is a str@@ an@@ ge course of action at a time when everyone - whether in the private sector or the public sector - is being asked to ensure transparency , reli@@ ability and truth when reading the budget figures .
this cannot continue and the Union must be as strict with itself as it is with others .
this situation enab@@ led us to rele@@ ase the investments that we wanted in the very short term and my colleagues will speak to you about this .
we also hope - and I am addres@@ sing the Commission at this point - that we shall see very good budget implementation this year , especially in the field of information and communication with the citizens .
like you , Commissioner , I hope that this year we shall make progress on the problem of setting up and implementing pil@@ ot projects , so that we are better able to meet our society &apos;s expectations .
finally , I am going to take a few minu@@ tes to say that one budget head@@ ing per@@ ple@@ xed us .
I turn this time towards my colleagues to say that , when we agreed to vote for the package on special events , we were entirely in agreement that the concept of European sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism should be fully implemented .
you gave us your word that World Y@@ outh D@@ ay in C@@ olog@@ ne is to be character@@ ised by respect for other cul@@ tures and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ies and that European money is to be used in an entirely sec@@ ular way ; you know , as I do , that we shall be w@@ at@@ ching carefully .
the adoption of the other institutions &quot; bud@@ gets , which took place without any problems , lead@@ s me simply to say that we must review our expenditure here because , by im@@ pos@@ ing sever@@ e restrictions on our expenditure , we have en@@ ded up im@@ pos@@ ing lim@@ ita@@ tions on ourselves and den@@ ied ourselves resources for working and exerc@@ ising our power and our pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ges with respect to the other institutions .
in conclusion , I should like simply to say that this budget will certainly be implemented without any great problem in 2005 , but that it is a trans@@ itional budget , which does not provide any real means of ensuring continu@@ ity and this is what is wor@@ rying us gre@@ atly .
nonetheless , I think that Mr P@@ itte@@ lla will be able to take up the ga@@ un@@ t@@ let even though this method cannot last and might hin@@ der us in the future from achieving bud@@ gets to mat@@ ch our political projects .
.
Mr President , the EU budget for 2005 is now at second reading in Parliament .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs , S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o and A@@ nne J@@ en@@ sen , for their excellent work .
I wish , l@@ ike@@ wise , to thank the Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Le@@ wan@@ do@@ w@@ s@@ ki , for his ster@@ ling lead@@ ership of the committee and Commissioner G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė and Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , repres@@ enting the Council , for their constructive cooperation .
the EU budget for 2005 may well meet next year &apos;s needs , but there are question mar@@ ks over it .
there was much w@@ ran@@ g@@ ling over payment appropriations , which loo@@ ked as if they were going to be too small .
out@@ standing commitments at present are about to reach the EUR 100 billion mark , of which appro@@ xim@@ ately EUR 70 billion represents the Structural Funds .
the poor levels of implementation of the budget in recent years have now created a back@@ lo@@ g .
right to the end , the Council wanted to limit payment appropriations .
it took much effort to bring payments up to the level of EUR 10@@ 6@@ .@@ 3 billion , which is still EUR 7@@ .@@ 9 billion bel@@ ow the financial perspective .
that , however , is EUR 500 billion , or more than 1 % of the EU &apos;s G@@ DP .
this budget c@@ eil@@ ing proposed by six Member States thus ha@@ un@@ ted the conciliation meeting .
even the Council , however , doub@@ ted the a@@ dequ@@ acy of the financing by adopting the joint resolution which proposed that any suppl@@ ementary budget relating to the Structural Funds should , if possible , be adopted at one reading .
the statement run@@ s contrary to good budgetary policy as the budget has to include all known expenditure for the financial year .
it should be mentioned that at the same conciliation meeting it was agreed to increase the payment appropriations in the Structural Funds this year by EUR 3@@ .@@ 7 billion , because funds have run out .
of this , EUR 2 billion was new money .
in the budget debate , the issue of the rapid rise in the number of A@@ gen@@ cies in the European Union was raised .
next year there will be 23 of them , of which five will be new .
EUR 40 million from the flexibility instrument had to be spent to meet their administrative costs , or else there would have been no financing available .
in recent times , a lot of A@@ gen@@ cies have been set up as a result of trade between Member States .
in 2000 there were still only se@@ ven A@@ gen@@ cies .
we should therefore take pro@@ mp@@ t action to dis@@ cover whether the A@@ gen@@ cies are the most effective way to develop the EU &apos;s administration .
it might be that this way we are establishing un@@ its that are hard to monitor and which are parti@@ ally responsible for creating nothing more than a double la@@ yer of bureauc@@ racy .
another question is presented by the various associ@@ ations and organisations that are granted appropriations directly out of the budget .
these ear@@ mar@@ ked su@@ ms are actually against the financial regulation .
we believe the system to be based on fav@@ our@@ it@@ ism , which mu@@ d@@ dies the grounds for financial support , making them un@@ clear .
Parliament should remain a legislative body and leave implementation tasks to the Commission , which would be the best way of monitoring im@@ parti@@ ality .
. Mr President , Commissioner G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , ladies and gentlemen , we may , today , be discussing the agreement with the Council about the 2005 Budget , but we are , of course , already looking to see how things will progress with the 2006 Budget and what is to be expected in the coming years in relation to the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
so I will tell you in pla@@ in language that my political evaluation of the result we have achieved for 2005 makes me both lau@@ gh and cr@@ y .
what I see as positive is the flexibility instrument .
I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr B@@ ö@@ ge , who made it very clear that we have succ@@ eeded in making these funds available now - not only for internal policy and the agencies , but also for foreign policy , above all for supporting the elections in Iraq .
that is a success , and it was one that we in this House saw as urg@@ ently necessary if we were to be equal to all the tasks set us .
I see it as in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble that we were able to up@@ hold as part of the Lisbon strategy our priority of up@@ gra@@ ding information policy , enab@@ ling us better to reach the citizens and vo@@ ters in Europe .
we Gre@@ ens also see it as important progress that the L@@ I@@ F@@ E programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have been preven@@ ted from fall@@ ing by the wa@@ y@@ side .
I would , however , like to say with equal clar@@ ity that what I see in a negative light is the sha@@ pe taken by the payments for 2005 .
we do , ad@@ m@@ itte@@ dly , conclude that this round of negotiations did not offer more room for man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re ; that is why we will vote in favour of this Budget .
I am right behind Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er in his critic@@ isms of the Council and in his statement descri@@ b@@ ing the 1 % criteri@@ on as mis@@ guid@@ ed f@@ et@@ is@@ his@@ m on the part of the Council .
I want to make that very pla@@ in to you , as I was very pleased to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er and I are of one mind .
the fact is that I do believe - and here I am addres@@ sing you , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï - that you stated , not only in the course of our negotiations during the conciliation procedure , but also in this House today , that this House , in exactly the same way as the national governments , must be willing to decide on priorities .
that is indeed so .
my fellow MEPs have also already said that we all have a great interest in budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine and a serious approach to the Budget .
in the same way , though , you cannot e@@ va@@ de our question , for if we have to set priorities , the same must also be said of the national governments .
your beli@@ ef that you have to make unila@@ teral cu@@ ts in which European policy los@@ es out I regard as the wrong approach .
politics risks being ren@@ a@@ tion@@ alised , and , for an enlarged Europe - for , for the first time , we are dealing with a Budget for 25 Member States - with new tasks and new challenges , that would be a mis@@ take .
if you want to fas@@ hi@@ on a truly European policy , you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that .
I do not at present see that in the position of the net contribu@@ ting countries and in the ob@@ session with 1 % . that I regard as a mis@@ take in political terms .
if we want to join together in further developing our won@@ der@@ ful continent , if we want to do more for economic renew@@ al , for spending on education , y@@ outh and new tal@@ ents , then join@@ tly , and together with you , the Council and the net contribu@@ tor countries - and this is where I am critical of the red / gre@@ en government in Germany - we must get moving in order to achieve more for Europe &apos;s benefit .
let me express , by way of conclusion , my gra@@ t@@ itude to all the staff and members of the Committee on Budgets .
I hope that we will continue to work together with such power@@ ful effect over the years to come in order to achieve much for Europe .
.
Mr President , my group has submitted a motion to reject the 2005 budget and I should like to explain the reasons for this initiative .
my group has never argu@@ ed in favour of a ras@@ h increase in the Union &apos;s budget .
we are committed to the ri@@ goro@@ us management of public funds and , above all , we do not consider the budget to be the only instrument available to the Union to realise its amb@@ itions .
in this respect , we wish to highlight , for example , the need for a fundamental re@@ ori@@ entation of the mis@@ sions and operation of the European Central Bank .
it remains true , however , that the Union &apos;s budget reflec@@ ts a political will .
the stated objectives must be mat@@ ched by sufficient financial resources , otherwise the EU &apos;s very credibility is at risk .
following the increasing pressure being exer@@ ted to reduce public expenditure at all cost in accordance with the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact , we have already had , in 2004 , the low@@ est budget rela@@ tive to gro@@ s@@ s national re@@ ven@@ ue since 198@@ 7 .
year after year , Parliament has critic@@ ised this restric@@ tive ten@@ d@@ ency , along with the la@@ bor@@ ious budgetary g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics that ac@@ company it ; such as the increasing nu@@ mb@@ ers of trans@@ f@@ ers and amen@@ ding bud@@ gets ; the reduction in essential appropriations , such as those intended for developing countries , to be able to finance new demands , for example the contribution to financing for the reconstruction of countries sever@@ ely affected by war , such as the Balkans , Afghanistan and Iraq ; and the mis@@ use of the flexibility instrument .
every year , Parliament critic@@ ises this tr@@ end and we have again just heard Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er , Mrs Gu@@ y @-@ Qu@@ int and Mrs T@@ r@@ ü@@ pe@@ l ech@@ o this dis@@ satisfac@@ tion .
I propose quite simply that this should be reflec@@ ted , this year , not only in words , but also in clear and visi@@ ble action .
to indic@@ ate that we finally wish to put an end to this syste@@ ma@@ tically restric@@ tive and short @-@ si@@ ghted policy on the part of the Council is the first reason for sub@@ mit@@ ting our motion to reject the 2005 budget .
the second reason for our decision is that next year will be the first full year of the Union of 25 .
the success of this enlargement as@@ sum@@ es , in our view , that we provide a budget sufficient to take on the un@@ avoid@@ able costs of inter@@ depend@@ ence associated with this great project , whilst ensuring that this does not involve ab@@ an@@ don@@ ing regions or popula@@ tions in difficul@@ ty in the old Member States .
I should add that the new efforts , the need for which is accepted by everyone , to support employment , education , training , research and the environment require commen@@ su@@ rate funding , unless it is considered that such new efforts are to be limited to just a few pro@@ fi@@ table n@@ ic@@ hes and a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged el@@ ite .
successful enlargement without bringing the popula@@ tions of the new and old Member States into competition with one another - that is the second reason why we tabled our motion to reject a poor draft budget .
finally , 2005 will be the decisive year in the attempt to reach agreement between the 25 on the financial perspec@@ tives for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
as has already been stated several times , a he@@ av@@ y mill@@ st@@ one is currently w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ing these negotiations down : the need of the six countries which are net contribu@@ tors to the Union &apos;s budget to have this limited in the future to 1 % or 0@@ .@@ 9 % of gro@@ s@@ s national re@@ ven@@ ue .
the Commission has drawn attention , quite rightly , to the fact that this would actually mean a s@@ w@@ ing@@ eing cut of more than EUR 9 billion in the 2007 budget in relation to the prec@@ eding financial year .
where would such d@@ ras@@ tic reduc@@ tions fall ?
on the great works announced with gr@@ and p@@ om@@ p and cer@@ em@@ on@@ y ?
on the Structural Funds ?
a little bit every@@ where ?
are we going to be ready for action when faced with such ir@@ responsible perspec@@ tives ?
if we were to accept without a fight a 2005 budget set at 1 % of gro@@ s@@ s national re@@ ven@@ ue , would we not be , in some ways , fall@@ ing in line with the min@@ d@@ set of the L@@ et@@ ter of the S@@ i@@ x ?
the third reason why we tabled our motion to reject the 2005 budget was to adopt a comb@@ ative stan@@ ce in Parliament before it is too late , on the eve of the decisive negotiations on the financial perspec@@ tives for the years to come .
.
Mr President , in EU countries about one for@@ tiet@@ h of tax re@@ ven@@ ue is spent by EU institutions .
in Bri@@ tain , we are told that this is a small price to pay for the pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ge of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the EU has brought us .
however , we are beginning to recognise , as k@@ ind@@ ly confirmed by e@@ x @-@ Commissioner K@@ inno@@ ck , that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and cooperate with EU countries and that our prosperity might well be higher if we were not in the EU .
they also tell us that the EU budget is small in compar@@ is@@ on with national bud@@ gets .
however , national bud@@ gets pay for some useful things , such as defence , education , health care and pensions .
the EU budget pa@@ ys for subsidies to agriculture - subsidies that agriculture would func@@ tion better without .
it pa@@ ys for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered wor@@ th@@ while .
it pa@@ ys for poor@@ ly tar@@ ge@@ ted over@@ se@@ as development aid .
it pa@@ ys for a@@ uditors to find out that 9@@ 3 % of re@@ ported spending was un@@ safe or rid@@ d@@ led with er@@ ro@@ rs .
it pa@@ ys for this Parliament .
let us stop argu@@ ing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pursu@@ it of the Lisbon Agenda .
let us look at the broad@@ er pic@@ ture .
as the last speak@@ er has just said , several countries with their own budget problems want a limit of one per cent of G@@ N@@ I .
the Commission rightly points out that it must be much larg@@ er if the expectations of the new accession countries are to be fulfi@@ lled .
how much larg@@ er - two per cent , four per cent ?
if the EU were genuinely concentra@@ ting on the ide@@ als it ke@@ ep@@ s proc@@ la@@ im@@ ing - peace , prosperity , strong econom@@ ies - it would be ac@@ ting very differ@@ ently .
it would not be looking at these various projects : it would be opening its markets properly , inter@@ n@@ ally and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally ; it would ce@@ ase ki@@ lling off our businesses with thousands of ill @-@ jud@@ ged pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tive rules , and its budget could be a small f@@ rac@@ tion of one per cent of G@@ DP .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , work on the Union &apos;s 2005 budget is almost at an end .
the Commission proposed a budget amoun@@ ting to EUR 10@@ 9 billion , the Council proposed a fig@@ ure of EUR 10@@ 5 billion and Parliament proposed EUR 1@@ 11 billion .
the final fig@@ ure is EUR 10@@ 6 billion .
the rapporteurs must of course be than@@ ked for their work , but the question ar@@ ises as to whether this amounts to success and an appropriate compromise .
in fact that is not the most crucial issue at sta@@ ke .
what is much more important is that the outcome is bel@@ ow expectations .
I can see other Members of this House share my view .
the policy of cu@@ ts w@@ on the day , despite enlargement of the Union to take in ten new Member States .
wis@@ h@@ ful thinking pre@@ va@@ iled , namely that it is possible to have a larg@@ er Union for less money .
the agreed level of expenditure may impact on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 , and this is even more wor@@ rying .
the Union for Europe of the Nations Group &apos;s attitude to the 2005 budget is that it is something that cannot currently be opposed , but we see no reason for re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
this is also an opportunity for broad@@ er reflec@@ tion .
Geor@@ ge K@@ enn@@ an obser@@ ved in the past that So@@ vi@@ et ex@@ pan@@ sion came about because of an in@@ ability to solve internal problems .
I trust the same will not be true of the European Union .
unfortunately , there are some wor@@ rying si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ities regarding two issues , the first of which is economic policy .
to date , the Union has pursu@@ ed a policy of cohesion and economic solidarity , helping the less @-@ developed countries so as to promote the development of the Member States as a whole .
at present , the concept of cohesion and economic solidarity is being written out of Union agreements .
wea@@ ken@@ ing cohesion policy or doing away with it al@@ together may lead to differences becoming even more entr@@ en@@ ched in the future .
this is especially likely if the Lisbon strategy comes to mean giving up on economic policy , that is , achieving the highest possible quality at the low@@ est possible cost , to the benefit of social policy in the more developed countries .
I refer to protecting jobs in those countries bur@@ den@@ ed with exces@@ sively high social costs .
the second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own id@@ entity .
events concerning Mr B@@ ut@@ ti@@ g@@ li@@ one and the failure to integra@@ te Isla@@ mic communities in W@@ estern Europe , as referred to recently in , are both relevant ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es@@ as is the question of the text of the pre@@ amb@@ le@@ to the Constitution .
at the same time , we are continuing to debate enlargement to include Turkey , without taking any account of the fundamental issues divid@@ ing the Union from Turkey .
the former include social , economic , political and cultural problems .
the response to the conflict between the the@@ ory of univers@@ al standards and particular ones has been to do away with standards of all kin@@ ds .
those determined to go to any l@@ eng@@ ths to achieve a feder@@ al Europe without borders , la@@ cking ide@@ ological id@@ entity and cohesion policy , are ac@@ ting to the d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ ent of the Union .
they are working s@@ low@@ ly but more surely against it than those who currently wish to har@@ m the Union with extre@@ mis@@ t language .
there can only be one conclusion , namely that in future , the Union must come up with a broad@@ er ide@@ ological id@@ entity and make more resources available , so as to implement cohesion and solidarity policy effectively .
( S@@ K ) T@@ han@@ k you .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please allow me to pic@@ k up on my colleague Mr R@@ os@@ z@@ ko@@ w@@ s@@ ki &apos;s words and present a few facts and figures .
for the year 2005 the Commission has come up with a draft level of payments of EUR 10@@ 9 billion , in its first reading the Council has come up with EUR 10@@ 5 billion , and Parliament has cal@@ cula@@ ted payments at EUR 1@@ 11 billion .
this cre@@ ates an impression of competent activity .
in the second round the Council has come to us with a draft level of payments again at EUR 10@@ 5@@ .@@ 3 billion while Parliament proposes EUR 10@@ 6@@ .@@ 3 billion , which is about 5 billion less than in the first round .
it is totally obvious who is taking the lead in this ga@@ me of budgetary p@@ ing @-@ pon@@ g , but it is also clear that the budgetary procedures are still not precisely defined .
if the proposed level of payments is passed by Parliament it will represent an increase of 6@@ .@@ 5 % compared to 2004 .
in compar@@ is@@ on with the pro@@ jec@@ ted level of inf@@ lation in the Euro@@ zone , this is a mo@@ des@@ t rise , but when set al@@ ong@@ side the need to finance the political goals and priorities of the European Union there seem to be fe@@ wer reasons for optimis@@ m .
as long as the quality criteri@@ on for the budgetary process of the European Union is the bringing together of the levels of contributions and payments , it is rather a reason for pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m .
a cou@@ ple of days ago , the European Parliament approved the annual report of the Court of Auditors for the financial year 2003 .
in the parliamentary discussion about this report there was agreement about one of the key conclusions , namely that the draw @-@ down level of credit payments or the implementation of the payments was rather low and for a long period has ho@@ ver@@ ed between 80 and 90 % .
in this respect the draft budget for the year 2005 does not bring any tur@@ n@@ around as it sugges@@ ts an implementation level for payments of 90 % .
as far as the structural funds are concerned , the le@@ vers for implementing budgetary resources in the form of the payments are in the hands of the governments of the EU Member States .
it is therefore an important role of Parliament to use its political instruments and to gain the support of the media in exer@@ ting appropriate pressure on the governments and the Council in order to make fu@@ ll@@ er and more effective use of the dispos@@ able resources to finance the common policies of the European Union .
if this does not happen , the parliamentary budgetary procedure will continue to be more a test of the lo@@ y@@ ality of Members of the European Parliament to the governments of their home countries rather than a test of the effectiveness and competitiveness of the budgetary process and the use of European Union resources .
thank you .
we will now hear the other speakers on today &apos;s list , with Mr S@@ ala@@ fran@@ c@@ a S@@ á@@ n@@ che@@ z @-@ Ne@@ yr@@ a to speak first .
I would like to a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise to him for a small er@@ ro@@ r in the order of speaking , which we managed to put right with his help and that of Mr Le@@ wan@@ do@@ w@@ s@@ ki .
.
Mr President , I believe that , in fact , Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure establish that , following the rapporteurs of the committee responsible for the main report , it is nor@@ m@@ ally the draf@@ t@@ sm@@ en of the opinions of the relevant committees who take the floor .
having said that , Mr President , I would like to thank you for your cour@@ tes@@ y and congratulate the general rapporteur for the budget , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , on the excellent work he has done and also on the way he has hand@@ led the negotiations with the Council and the Commission .
with regard to head@@ ing 4 , we have faced the problems that trad@@ iti@@ on@@ ally ar@@ ise in that c@@ hap@@ ter , this year with the EUR 200 million for Iraq , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has pointed out .
we have been able to find a satisfactory solution , but in any event , we believe that the solution proposed by the Commission would have been better because that would have sa@@ ved us cu@@ ts in head@@ ing 4 in the su@@ m of EUR 15 million .
I believe that Mr B@@ ö@@ ge &apos;s comments are absolutely right , that is to say , we cannot take on new commitments every year at the expen@@ se of the European Union &apos;s traditional external action priorities .
we must ra@@ tion@@ alise the use of the flexibility instrument , which is govern@@ ed by certain rules which must be respected for the sa@@ ke of the credibility of our European Union project ; in terms of the review of the coming financial perspec@@ tives , surely we will be able to reach an agreement on the solution to this issue .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion of the Committee on Development , Mr W@@ ij@@ k@@ man , for his excellent cooperation and his willingness at all times to find solutions which are compatible with the priorities of his committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Commissioner lu@@ ck in her du@@ ties and ask her to facilitate our work by not taking on commitments which have no budgetary support , because I believe that , by taking that approach , we will be able to cooperate more effectively in relation to the objective that ins@@ pi@@ res us all .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , difficult negotiations have concluded with a credi@@ table result .
for this we should thank the rapporteurs , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o and Mrs J@@ en@@ sen , all the political groups and the new Commissioner , who has given us valuable help and whose good wishes I gla@@ dly reci@@ proc@@ ate .
the agreement can be seen as satisfactory to Parliament because it brings with it many positive out@@ comes .
it has been a difficult pas@@ sa@@ ge , but we have got through it , and have ob@@ tained funding for reconstruction in Iraq , the main@@ ten@@ ance of traditional ge@@ ograph@@ ical policies , funds for S@@ ME@@ s , information and research as well as resources for the agencies .
also ente@@ red in the budget are resources for the structural funds and pil@@ ot projects , some of which are very interesting , such as E@@ ras@@ mus for ap@@ pr@@ en@@ tic@@ es and the pil@@ ot projects on conflict prevention and on small arms reduction .
we cannot , however , pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce ourselves satisfied with the way in which the c@@ hap@@ ter on payment appropriations was concluded .
I am well aware that this is not the fa@@ ult of either Parliament or the Commission , which in fact help@@ ed us and pres@@ sed as hard as it could .
however , the st@@ one @-@ c@@ old inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bility with which the Council stu@@ ck by the 1 % is wor@@ thy of a better cause and does not au@@ gu@@ r well either for negotiations on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive or for the next budget , for which I hope that it will be possible to achieve more ambitious and gra@@ ti@@ fying goals , as Mrs Gu@@ y @-@ Qu@@ int also said .
we have gone a little beyond the 1 % mark .
it was right to give this signal , as Parliament will not accept a Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive which forces the Union to for@@ sa@@ ke its own tasks and du@@ ties , which are en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the tre@@ aties .
pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar ideas are cir@@ cula@@ ting and sometimes a kind of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological bu@@ ll@@ ying is also used towards the new Member States to make them maintain the so @-@ called ri@@ goro@@ us line .
ladies and gentlemen , ri@@ g@@ our consis@@ ts in transparent , effective and efficient administration , but it does not mean ref@@ using to act with the lead@@ ership expected by European citizens .
Article 15@@ 8 of the Treaty aff@@ ir@@ ms that economic and social cohesion policy is one of Europe &apos;s main tasks .
anyone thinking of par@@ ed @-@ down bud@@ gets , of reducing and concentra@@ ting the structural funds on certain areas only , of ren@@ a@@ tion@@ alis@@ ing the cohesion policy and de@@ pri@@ ving the Lisbon strategy of the requ@@ is@@ ite resources should be aware right now that they will be met with the firm opposition of this Parliament .
Mr President , as the representative of my political group , I have been following the budget debate in the Committee on Budgets since the s@@ pring .
I am sure that both rapporteurs have done their very best , but , despite that , my group is proposing the budget be rejected for the reasons of policy that our Cha@@ irman , Fran@@ c@@ is W@@ ur@@ t@@ z , mentioned at the start of the sitting .
the problem from Parliament &apos;s point of view is budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent .
str@@ ing@@ ent budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine is suppl@@ em@@ ented by an inter@@ institutional agreement , which was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led through the European Parliament in May , 1999 .
the previous Parliament was unable , as is the current one , to have an influence on the c@@ eil@@ ings for appropriations determined in the inter@@ institutional agreement .
the only way to create more flexibility would have been to termin@@ ate the inter@@ institutional agreement that came about in such str@@ an@@ ge circumstances , but Parliament has not been prepared to do that , in s@@ pite of the fact that the inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bility of the budget has been common knowledge .
this lack of flexibility is in the Council &apos;s interests , but not Parliament &apos;s .
I would , however , like to thank the Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets , and the rapporteurs and coordin@@ ators , for their excellent levels of cooperation , even though my group has decided to propose that the budget be rejected .
Mr President , in my speech I would like to tou@@ ch upon the issue of the budget allocated for the requirements of the common foreign and security policy .
a cou@@ ple of dec@@ ad@@ es ago there were already pre@@ dic@@ tions that the twenty @-@ first century would be a time of increased risks and thre@@ ats .
against this back@@ ground the European Union &apos;s wish to promote stability not only in Europe , but also to achieve greater influence more generally in world security processes is very important .
this is confirmed by the European Union &apos;s declar@@ ed wish and growing ability to be able to participate in conflict prevention and crisis management activities - and of course the challenges are not dec@@ reas@@ ing .
it is anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted that in the ne@@ ar future the number of civil crisis management operations will double .
speci@@ alists are discussing possible operations in Iraq , S@@ ud@@ an and the C@@ ong@@ o .
maintaining a stable situation in the European Union &apos;s neighbour@@ ing countries is no less important .
it is worth men@@ tioning Geor@@ gia and the operations in the countries of the Bal@@ kan region .
let us not forget that thre@@ ats of terrorism in@@ side the European Union are a real possibility .
measures to combat the s@@ pread of weapons of mass destruction are still important .
Europe &apos;s institutional capac@@ ities in the sp@@ here of crisis management need to be developed .
therefore , it is very clear that the tr@@ end of the activities of the European Union &apos;s common foreign and security policy is ine@@ vi@@ tably up@@ wards .
seeing the amount of resources allocated for these measures in the budget for 2005 , however , gives cause for concern about the dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy between Europe &apos;s political amb@@ itions and the financial resources available to fulfil these amb@@ itions .
the in@@ suffici@@ ency of resources needed to success@@ fully achieve Europe &apos;s security strategy is often discussed amongst speci@@ alists in the institution within the relevant fields .
certainly , one should welcome the fact that at second reading the European Parliament has all@@ ot@@ ted 10 million more for needs than at first reading .
however , even then it is not possible to understand the tac@@ tical reasons which led Parliament &apos;s Bud@@ getary Con@@ tro@@ l Committee to alloc@@ ate EUR 10 million less at first reading for the needs of coordin@@ ating these important goals .
unfortunately , in order to prevent this er@@ r@@ one@@ ous approach by the European Parliament , it was necessary to put the conciliation procedure into effect .
Mr President , lis@@ ten in on this debate , and you hear the cr@@ y of &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more &quot; on every side .
I , too , am in favour of &apos; more , &quot; but of more efficiency and transparency , whether we are talking about the Lisbon strategy or security policy .
after all , we would have the money if we were , once and for all , to tackle the huge sa@@ c@@ red co@@ ws that l@@ ur@@ k in the Parlia@@ mentary budget and , of course , particularly in this enormous Budget , which run@@ s to hun@@ dre@@ ds of bill@@ ions of euro@@ s .
let me just make two points about it .
transparency would also mean making it pla@@ in how the political parties are now to be fun@@ ded , a question to which first reading provided no un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous answer .
transparency would also mean another vote on the sec@@ re@@ tari@@ al allow@@ ance , which is now again to be sur@@ re@@ p@@ t@@ iti@@ ously increased .
unfortunately , though , there is not going to be one .
so you cannot be surpris@@ ed at the perc@@ ep@@ tion that the Budget is about ha@@ gg@@ ling , and that you , Commissioner , are described as some@@ one who had conc@@ ed@@ ed a billion euro@@ s an h@@ our .
no proper budget can be drawn up in this fas@@ hi@@ on ; what is needed is explanation and change .
Mr President , I have lear@@ n@@ t something very useful in the Committee on Budgets and something which has made life much easier for me , namely that it is best to begin by thanking the relevant individuals , in order to have am@@ ple time to do so .
I should therefore like to thank Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , the rapporteur , and also Mrs J@@ en@@ sen .
it is worth re@@ memb@@ ering that the coordin@@ ators and V@@ ice @-@ Cha@@ ir@@ men are responsible for the climate of cooperation character@@ ising work on the budget in the European Parliament .
this con@@ tras@@ ts with similar work in national parliaments .
thanks are therefore due to Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er , Mrs Gu@@ y @-@ Qu@@ int , Mrs T@@ r@@ ü@@ pe@@ l , Mr Sep@@ pä@@ nen , Mr R@@ os@@ z@@ ko@@ w@@ s@@ ki and to Mr W@@ al@@ ter , Mr B@@ ö@@ ge and Mr M@@ ul@@ der , the V@@ ice @-@ Cha@@ ir@@ men .
I trust the same climate of cooperation will pre@@ va@@ il on Th@@ urs@@ day , when we do@@ t the i &apos;s on the 2005 Budget .
the final ver@@ sion of this budget resul@@ ted from very difficult negotiations with the Council .
we appreciate the wish to cooperate and reach a compromise dis@@ played by the Dutch Presidency , and in particular by Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , and also by Commissioner G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , who ac@@ ted as moder@@ a@@ tor during the ten@@ se hours of the meeting .
it is certainly true that Parliament def@@ en@@ ded its priorities .
it res@@ or@@ ted to the flexibility instrument , especially in the areas of internal policy and foreign policy that are very important to us .
nonetheless , those who spoke in the House today emphas@@ ised that the situation will get worse .
if we project ourselves into the future , into the next mul@@ ti @-@ annual Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive , things look b@@ le@@ ak@@ er .
I am sure that s@@ lim@@ ming down the Structural Funds , together with a tri@@ part@@ ite declaration to anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate an amendment to the budget , cannot be described as sound financial program@@ ming .
as regards the budget procedure , 2005 was a year of new beg@@ inn@@ ings .
consequently , the quality of administration was particularly important .
I should therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fi@@ al@@ h@@ o , Mr De Fe@@ o and the whole te@@ am .
they are genuine civil ser@@ van@@ ts of the kind still so@@ rely la@@ cking in post @-@ Commun@@ ist Europe .
they au@@ gu@@ r well for the success of future work on the budget .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , investment conditions in the countries of the European Union are fav@@ ourable at the present time .
we have low interest rates , there are no inf@@ la@@ tionary pres@@ su@@ res , and we have sufficient reser@@ ves .
if we compar@@ e the economy of the European Union with the economy of the United States , however , we have to say that inves@@ tors achieve a greater prof@@ it and a quic@@ ker return on their investment in the United States with the same level of investment .
the European Union must therefore ori@@ enta@@ te itself towards structural reforms at all levels and in all its institutions .
it is not appropriate to measure the effectiveness of the financial resources inves@@ ted in particular areas and indus@@ tries only on the basis of their scale .
in the abs@@ ence of fe@@ ed@@ back enab@@ ling us to evalu@@ ate qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive indic@@ ators , we must integra@@ te and advan@@ ce the measu@@ re@@ ment of quality and the measu@@ re@@ ment of added value .
this also goes for sci@@ ence and research , as Her@@ r W@@ ur@@ t@@ z has said today .
the Member States must be eng@@ aged in this process .
each one of them should draft their own Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy , their own financial perspec@@ tives and base their re@@ ven@@ ues and costs on them .
we all know that the main b@@ att@@ leg@@ round for the Lisbon targets is the implementation of reforms at a national level .
I mention all of this because when we talk about the annual bud@@ gets , financial perspec@@ tives and the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy , we always talk about collective po@@ ts .
we have finally reached a compromise in our discussions on the budget for 2005 .
I believe that we can approve the budget collec@@ tively .
I would like to thank all the members of the Bud@@ getary Committee for their constructive approach .
we all know that the 2005 budget is a trans@@ itional budget .
the draf@@ ting of new financial perspec@@ tives lies ahead of us .
with the help of these we will have a chance of making a better start on the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy , which would then take on a different quality .
I should like first of all to thank our rapporteur , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , even though he cannot be here , since it is clearly a ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th task to examine the budget .
last year , Mr President of the Council , Commissioner , the budget passed through the symb@@ ol@@ ic bar@@ ri@@ er of EUR 100 billion .
this year , there is a feel@@ ing that the no@@ vel@@ ty has wor@@ n off .
we have reached the end of two great budgetary cy@@ cles and the end , perhaps , of two political wor@@ l@@ ds .
first of all , clearly , we have reached the end of the Prodi cy@@ cle , of the planning for 2000 @-@ 2006 and already , with a temporary Commission , we have been and are still working on the 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 cy@@ cle .
at the same time , however , we have also reached the end of the cy@@ cle of European budgetary mo@@ des@@ ty . the European budget , in fact , even at EUR 10@@ 6 billion , is less than Spain &apos;s ( EUR 1@@ 17 billion for Spain ) .
everyone realis@@ es that , with the arri@@ val of Turkey , it is not just EUR 2@@ 7@@ 7 million which will have to be added , at pre @-@ accession stage , but EUR 33 billion every year .
ten years from now , consequently , the European budget will have doub@@ led and the question of European taxation will have to be addressed .
we shall no longer be talking about 1 % or 1.@@ 24 % of gro@@ s@@ s national re@@ ven@@ ue .
we shall then have reached the end of two political wor@@ l@@ ds .
first of all , the world of Parliament @-@ Council relations , since , in 200@@ 9 , the distinc@@ tion between com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y and non @-@ com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y expenditure will have dis@@ appe@@ ared and the anti @-@ farming majority in this Parliament will rule against the agricultural world and the rural world .
this will at the same time be the end of a second world , which is already happening now , since , in the 2005 budget , the agricultural appropriations have been cut by a billion euro and , subsequ@@ ently , these appropriations are to be pl@@ under@@ ed in order to finance other things on the pre@@ text of rural development .
however , the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance from vill@@ ages of post offic@@ es , rail@@ way sta@@ tions , public re@@ ven@@ ue offic@@ es and public services clearly shows where we are head@@ ing .
this is why I would have lik@@ ed us , with the assistance of our rapporteur and the assistance of our colleagues , to be able , in the 2006 budget , to create a European public hol@@ id@@ ay in hon@@ our of rural ma@@ y@@ ors in order to pay hom@@ age to the work of the 9@@ 0@@ .000 rural ma@@ y@@ ors of the vill@@ ages of Europe .
otherwise , our 2005 budget already bel@@ ong@@ s to the cos@@ y little world of a Europe with wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide amb@@ itions and a prov@@ in@@ cial budget .
Mr Mar@@ tin@@ e@@ z , I did not realise myself that we were looking at all these things together in this budget discussion .
perhaps Mr D@@ om@@ bro@@ v@@ s@@ k@@ is will say something different .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the PPE @-@ DE Group stands for transparency and maximum appropriate use of EU budget resources .
the PPE @-@ DE Group expres@@ ses regret that the majority of the European Parliament has rejected our group &apos;s proposal concerning the reduction of the European Parliament &apos;s expenditure bel@@ ow the traditional 20 % of total administrative expenditure .
it has to be acknowled@@ ged that this year we chan@@ ne@@ lled appro@@ xim@@ ately EUR 1@@ 50 million of un@@ spent funds towards advan@@ ce payments for next year &apos;s expenditure .
this clearly shows how well @-@ foun@@ ded the PPE @-@ DE Group &apos;s proposal was .
in relation to other institutions , even before the first reading the European Parliament had evalu@@ ated the additional budget requests of the EU institutions and it supported at first reading those requests , which were acknowled@@ ged to be justified .
one should rec@@ all that the majority of requests for additional budget alloc@@ ations by the EU institutions are related to the enlargement of the EU , as well as with the new EU financial and staff regulations .
therefore , at second reading we princi@@ ply renew@@ ed the requests for additional budget alloc@@ ations by the EU institutions that the European Parliament had endor@@ sed , but which the European Council of Ministers had rejected .
in order to ensure greater EU budget transparency and appropriate use of budget resources , the European Parliament has come up with two new initiatives .
firstly , we inv@@ ite the Commission , when it sub@@ m@@ its its annual draft EU budget proposal , to sub@@ mit information at the same time , on official pos@@ ts that are va@@ c@@ ant or have been re@@ organised during the year .
this will allow the European Parliament to better ass@@ ess the justi@@ fication for reques@@ ting new official pos@@ ts .
secondly , in order to ensure more appropriate use of EU budget resources as regards the need for ex@@ tra ro@@ oms , ch@@ i@@ efly in connection with the enlargement of the EU , we inv@@ ite all the EU institutions to work together and to allow their ro@@ oms to be used for the requirements of other institutions .
this will make it possible to guarantee the ro@@ oms necessary for various meetings and other events without un@@ necessary additional expenditure on building or r@@ enting ro@@ oms .
finally , a few words on regional policy .
the European Parliament wel@@ comes the improvements in 2004 for the acqu@@ is@@ ition of structural funds and does not understand stan@@ ce in reducing expenditure appropriations for 2005 .
the European Parliament considers it necessary to pay the commitments set out in the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive in due time , and not to def@@ er payments to the last year of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
Mr President , these people have got a ner@@ ve and I am a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed they have the te@@ mer@@ ity to turn up here .
they have not had their accounts signed off for the last ten years and they want more money to waste , to ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t , to give in fraud and cor@@ ruption .
had they been running a small company in my country , they would not only have been prosecu@@ ted , they would probably have been ja@@ iled !
why should I vote for this ? tell me !
why should any of my constitu@@ ents ? why should any of my coun@@ tr@@ ym@@ en ?
in my country , there are 2@@ .@@ 6 million pen@@ sioners living in poverty on means @-@ tes@@ ted benefits ; there are 3@@ .@@ 6 million children bel@@ ow the poverty level ; there are 3@@ .@@ 9 million chil@@ d@@ less ad@@ ul@@ ts living in poverty ; and we are a rich country !
we are the four@@ th @-@ larg@@ est economy in the world .
why are so many of my constitu@@ ents living in poverty ?
because you lot get the money !
because 19 billion p@@ oun@@ ds of it goes to the ine@@ fficient common agricultural policy to support ine@@ fficient French , Italian and Greek farmers .
why should my constitu@@ ents su@@ ffer for their fraud , their cor@@ ruption , and their ine@@ ffici@@ ency ?
they should not .
just taking back our money from the common agricultural policy would increase pensions by 30 p@@ oun@@ ds a week .
were my constitu@@ ents asked to give the money to France , Italy and Greece ?
no !
were they consul@@ ted ?
no !
were they given a vote ?
no !
and would they have voted for it had they been ?
no , they would not ; and neither will I .
you can put your ga@@ vel down now , Mr President , because I have fin@@ ished on time .
absolutely , I also regret it because we should have lik@@ ed you to continue .
in fact , I do not know what you were talking about , whether it was really about the European Union , but there is no doubt that the budget was the subject .
Mr President , it may be that the best thing one can do for democracy is to remain objective about things with which one dis@@ agre@@ es , and that is what I shall try to do , as the Committee on Transport and Tou@@ rism was not in agreement with every aspect of the proposals .
there were two that it highli@@ ghted : the first had to do with the tr@@ ans @-@ European networks , where , in a desire to send a signal about enlargement , the commitment appropriations were increased .
I see that as a positive sign for , after all , the expenditure must be commen@@ su@@ rate with the projects .
the second point of dis@@ agreement concerned agencies , where the situation is , as we see it , far more difficult , for , whether in relation to safety , or to transport by road , air , sea or rail , there are many areas in which a political agreement has been reached between the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
when , though , it comes to alloc@@ ating the necessary funding , this does not - as@@ ton@@ is@@ h@@ ingly enough - always apply . for that reason , where these agencies are concerned , the question ar@@ ises in our min@@ ds as to whether person@@ nel costs really bel@@ ong there , because they e@@ at into the operational appropriations , or whether the person@@ nel appropriations ought to go some@@ where else .
I do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now .
the other point I would make de@@ als with very important areas .
of course we are glad that , in the area of measures to combat mar@@ ine pollution , which was en@@ vis@@ aged and proposed by the Council to be a z@@ ero entry , a to@@ ken entry , there are now some funds available after all , so that we can at least explain to the outside world that we now have not only the political will , but also the means , to interven@@ e in that area .
it will be for the future to show whether the EUR 17 million will be enough , after we proposed far in exc@@ ess of EUR 20 million .
the same applies in the case of rail and air transport .
there is evidence from these agencies that they cannot do the job properly with the funds allocated to them , and so the war@@ ning from the Committee on Transport and Tou@@ rism is that we cannot wait for the next disaster before adjus@@ ting the resources in line with the facts of the situation .
Mr President , I wish to refer to two aspects of this debate .
the first is the refer@@ ences to agencies and to bio@@ terrorism , and I link those two because part of the bio@@ terrorism work is done through the new C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ise@@ ase Con@@ tro@@ l which has now been established in Sweden .
one of the compla@@ ints of this paper is that these have not been a@@ dequ@@ ately fun@@ ded , so that there is un@@ certainty about how they are to operate .
our citizens believe that Europe is very often eng@@ aged in spending money on activities that are less than necessary .
there are some activities which they believe are fundamenta@@ lly necessary .
their safety is at the heart of that and it is in our interests and our responsibility to ensure that they are properly fun@@ ded .
therefore , I hope that in future the Commission and my colleagues in this House will ensure that agencies dealing with issues such as food safety , medicines control and evaluation and disease control and prevention are properly dealt with .
the second aspect relates to the work which lies ahead on vacc@@ ines and support for developing countries .
we know how important they are - I myself have produced a report on the health thre@@ ats to the countries of the developing world .
we know that vacc@@ ination campa@@ ig@@ ns have been effective , but much more that can be done .
in the last four years some 35 million children have been vacc@@ in@@ ated - for example against he@@ pat@@ it@@ is B - but millions of children are at risk and d@@ ying because adequate funds are not available .
I very much welcome what is being done to put money into the vacc@@ ine funds , and I hope we can continue in that direction , because that , again , makes a difference of which we can be pro@@ ud .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to extend war@@ m thanks to the rapporteur , Mr S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , for the excellent cooperation .
even though I am only moder@@ ately pleased with the end result , I do think he has done what he can in order to put the position of Parliament , but even more so the position of the European coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , in perspective .
I feel the same way about the Dutch Presidency , and this brings me directly to my major disap@@ poin@@ tment about this Budget .
with this agreement , we are ultimately ne@@ arly one billion under the correct estima@@ te and the Commission proposal about what is needed .
I know that the Dutch Presidency has played a positive role in itself in order to prevent this in part , but I am disap@@ pointed gre@@ atly with the rest of the Council , where the last Commission proposal was even@@ tually not followed .
which surpris@@ es me if I consider the position of Europe &apos;s coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , if I consider the major agricultural reform that has now started and which will result in sometimes d@@ ras@@ tic dro@@ ps in income , but it also surpris@@ es me if I consider the enormous programme for rural development that we need to introduce as yet in the ten new Member States .
given these circumstances , econom@@ ising to that extent is unacceptable , certainly if we realise that agricultural spending will be around 0@@ .@@ 4 % of the G@@ N@@ P next year .
that is excep@@ tion@@ ally little if we see that European agriculture and hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ ture meet the world &apos;s stric@@ test standards in terms of the environment , animal welfare , lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e protection , food security and food safety .
anyone who wants a che@@ a@@ p r@@ ide could get a n@@ as@@ ty surpris@@ e .
we cannot go on like this .
I hope that this will not lead to further cu@@ ts in the agricultural budget , but that we will continue to fight for competitive agriculture , even in Europe .
in that respect , I should like to say two things to the UK In@@ depend@@ ence Party Members and N@@ on @-@ atta@@ ched Members in response to their expres@@ sions of bla@@ me direc@@ ted towards European agricultural policy .
I can tell them that the United Kingdom receiv@@ es a dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately large share from the agricultural budget .
my own country represents 7 % of production and only receiv@@ es 2 % of the money .
in the United Kingdom , the ex@@ act re@@ ver@@ se is true .
without this Parliament , the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom would not have reached a satisfactory conclusion .
if these gentlemen can do nothing but make dis@@ par@@ ag@@ ing remarks , they have failed to get the message , including in the British coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , and they are lea@@ ving the British coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side firmly out in the c@@ old .
in any event , Parliament , and the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are keeping an e@@ ye on the British coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
the citizens of Europe are the jud@@ ges of our actions .
I believe that this budget compromise allows us to conf@@ id@@ ently look them in the e@@ ye , as it provides us with the means to reach our goals .
but will the resources described in budget 2005 be sufficient for the long term ?
we understand that a state budget defic@@ it makes governments try to minim@@ ise expenditure .
however , if expenditure fall@@ s bel@@ ow a certain level , it becomes poin@@ t@@ less : if goals remain dre@@ am@@ s , then every euro spent will just be th@@ ro@@ wn down the dra@@ in .
the current budget is not like this yet , but we should put a lot more effort into certain areas in order for our enterprises to be competitive on a wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide scale and in order to help cohesion countries to cat@@ ch up with other states so@@ on@@ er .
we must pay attention to the fact that this compromise , which I support , expen@@ ds a lot less money than what was planned at the 199@@ 0 budgetary cy@@ cle .
the question ar@@ ises now at the time of planning a new cy@@ cle : what is the point in setting goals for the dis@@ tant future , or giving nu@@ mb@@ ers for several years ahead , if we do not fulfil them ?
we , who li@@ ved under So@@ vi@@ et domin@@ ation , li@@ ved and experienc@@ ed what it meant to construc@@ t five @-@ year plans from gra@@ tu@@ it@@ ous nu@@ mb@@ ers .
I would like to see the Union avoid@@ ing these pit@@ fall@@ s , I have fa@@ it@@ h it will , and I support next year &apos;s budget .
Mr President , I would like to a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise yet again for not being at the conciliation meeting , which was a very l@@ eng@@ thy and hard @-@ f@@ ought aff@@ air .
I pay tribu@@ te to the new Commissioner , and particularly the minis@@ ter , who was in charge .
I heard reports that the Council of Ministers was at one in its stan@@ ce on what the level of spending should be .
as some@@ one from the United Kingdom - although not of the same political party as the government - I very much welcome its statement , together with that of five other countries , that there should be no level of spending above one per cent of G@@ N@@ I or G@@ DP .
I am delighted that the outcome of this conciliation was exactly that .
as regards the agencies , more thought needs to be given to the question of their income in the future .
I welcome the move away from in @-@ house activity , away from the Commission and into arms @-@ l@@ eng@@ th agencies ; but these have mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ ed , which is a sign of their success .
we now need to look at how much more income they can achieve from outside sources instead of just being given grant @-@ in @-@ aid or subsidies from this Parliament .
I speak here as some@@ one who was ch@@ i@@ ef execu@@ tive of the Na@@ tional Bu@@ il@@ ding Agency in the United Kingdom .
we had to turn around very quickly from being 8@@ 5 per cent supported by grants or subsidies to being wh@@ oll@@ y self @-@ supporting .
it can be done .
however , I am not saying the change needs to be that vic@@ ious .
finally , with regard to structural funding , the very sensible agreement that was reached , namely , to reduce the spen@@ d in 2005 but to have an arrang@@ ement in read@@ in@@ ess agreed by all parties that a suppl@@ ementary and amen@@ ding budget could be brought in at any time , means both that we have control over what is happening in 2005 and that reasons have to be shown why we need real spen@@ d in 2006 .
Mr President , as draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion for the report of the Committee on Agriculture , I regret the ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary cu@@ ts decided on by the Council of Ministers in spending on common agricultural policy subsidies for 2005 .
this is a cut of no more and no less than EUR 1 billion , compared to the European Commission &apos;s pre@@ l@@ imin@@ ary draft budget , an un@@ preced@@ ented decision , taken , furthermore , within the key context of the debate on the European Union &apos;s future financial perspec@@ tives .
I condemn the f@@ li@@ p@@ pan@@ cy with which the Council of Ministers has adopted this decision because it je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ es the funding of agricultural subsidies for next year , which are the consequ@@ ence of a for@@ mal commitment by the Member States to the European Union &apos;s farmers .
the Council &apos;s decision lea@@ ves the management of common agricultural policy subsidies in a prec@@ ar@@ ious situation , and this will obli@@ ge the Commission to apply spending dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine which could lead it to com@@ mit more than one in@@ justice .
there has been mention of the possibility of later on introducing the amen@@ ding budget to pat@@ ch up the hol@@ es in the 2005 agriculture budget , although so far we do not know where those necessary resources are going to come from .
it is clear that the countries in favour of reducing the contributions to the Community budget have w@@ on the first b@@ attle , because the Council of Ministers has unanim@@ ously supported this cut .
this unanim@@ ity also included my country .
nobody has d@@ ared to question this decision , which , furthermore , takes no account of the opinion of this House .
at first reading the European Parliament re @-@ established the European Commission &apos;s pre@@ l@@ imin@@ ary draft budget , an initiative which has been completely ig@@ no@@ red by the Council of Ministers , the only body with decision @-@ making powers with regard to obli@@ g@@ atory spending .
the cut in agricultural spending for 2005 is simply a for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of what could happen from 2007 , when the European Commission will have to present a report to ass@@ ess whether or not it is necessary to introduce cu@@ ts in the uni@@ t su@@ ms of the direct aid received by European farmers .
unfortunately , the European Parliament &apos;s voice has not been taken into account on this occasion .
I would , therefore , like to call on this House to try to prevent this situation from rec@@ ur@@ ring next year .
Mr President , just like Mr S@@ ala@@ fran@@ c@@ a S@@ á@@ n@@ che@@ z @-@ Ne@@ yr@@ a , I am somewhat conf@@ used about the speaking arrangements .
I am speaking in this House as draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion of the Committee on Development on the Budget and should in fair@@ ness have been allowed to speak at the beginning .
I wish to congratulate Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o on his very s@@ kil@@ ful work , for his considerable sens@@ iti@@ vity to views from the various committees and , in general , for his efficient hand@@ ling of our deliber@@ ations .
as current representative of the Committee on Development , I am delighted with the result .
by making full use of the flexibility mechanism , we have been able to avoid signific@@ antly cu@@ tting back on long @-@ term development programmes in order to make room for Iraq .
I genuinely agree with Mr S@@ ala@@ fran@@ c@@ a S@@ á@@ n@@ che@@ z @-@ Ne@@ yr@@ a that we must find a long @-@ term solution to the problem that , in general , ar@@ ises every year in connection with major disas@@ ters and cris@@ es .
we must protect our long @-@ term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives .
when it comes to the specific focus in head@@ ing 4 , I am very pleased to have ga@@ ined a hear@@ ing for the demand that the budget be more clearly ori@@ ented towards poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation .
this is happening through the increase of EUR 30 million in the appropri@@ ation to efforts within Asia , where the vas@@ t majority of the world &apos;s poor live .
it is also happening through the increase in efforts in the area of health .
more resources are being ear@@ mar@@ ked for the work on reducing the s@@ pread of H@@ I@@ V , mal@@ aria and T@@ B .
as Mr B@@ ow@@ is emphas@@ ised just now , a new programme to the tun@@ e of EUR 10 million is also being set up to combat other poverty @-@ related diseases , with a special emphasis on vacc@@ in@@ ations for young children .
far greater resources are needed in the area of health , especially in Africa .
the contributions we are now decid@@ ing upon mean that we are continuing single @-@ min@@ de@@ dly to work with a view to increasing support for the health sector within the sp@@ here of aid , and that is an entirely proper road to go down .
. Mr President , let me start by thanking Members of Parliament for their interesting remarks .
my first re@@ mark is in response to what Mrs T@@ r@@ ü@@ pe@@ l and Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z said .
it is absolutely clear that I am speaking here not on behalf of the net contribu@@ tors , the &apos; one per cent group &apos; , or the government of the Netherlands , but on behalf of the Council .
the Council was unanim@@ ously in favour of budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine .
it was also unanim@@ ously in favour of only a s@@ light increase in payment appropriations , taking into account the needs of an enlarged Union .
this brings me to concerns expressed by Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er , Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z and Mr Ma@@ at about the level of payment appropriations not being enough for all the needs in 2005 .
the Council &apos;s second reading is based on the principle of budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine .
the Council was united in believ@@ ing that the level of payment appropriations was of pr@@ ime importance . this is why the Council show@@ ed an example by reducing com@@ pul@@ sor@@ y expenditure in the field of agriculture .
in our global agreement , the payment appropriations are EUR 1 billion higher than the Council &apos;s estima@@ te of what is necessary to fulfil the obligations in 2005 .
according to the Commission , which has to implement the budget , the agreed maximum amount is sufficient .
equally important is the fact that the Council will take up its responsibility if it tur@@ ns out that payment appropriations are in@@ sufficient .
the Council has proved that this is not a ho@@ ll@@ ow ph@@ r@@ ase : it provided additional payments for structural measures this year , as you know .
we have committed ourselves to doing this in just one reading for any additional funding needed , as Commissioner G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė mentioned .
it was interesting to hear Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er &apos;s question on the results in conciliation with regard to the additional funds for 2005 .
he for@@ got to mention the EUR 10 billion that we got back un@@ spent in 2003 .
in conclusion , I agree with Commissioner G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė that they were tou@@ gh negotiations .
I would like to thank her , the rapporteurs and the Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets for their constructive role in the negotiations .
the result is what coun@@ ts , and it is a good compromise .
I very much agree with Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o , who said it is not a w@@ in @-@ lose situation , it is a w@@ in @-@ w@@ in situation : there is room for both budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine and political priorities .
at the end of the day it is a w@@ in @-@ w@@ in situation for European citizens .
- I do not think that the Commission wishes to interven@@ e again .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on Th@@ urs@@ day at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m .
-@@ the next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr B@@ or@@ re@@ l@@ l F@@ on@@ tell@@ es , on behalf of the T@@ em@@ por@@ ary Committee on Policy C@@ hall@@ eng@@ es and Bud@@ getary Me@@ ans of the En@@ larg@@ ed Union , on the prepar@@ ation of the next financial framework .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Prodi Commission left us with two commun@@ ications : one on the general framework for the 2007 @-@ 20@@ 15 budget and another on the legal b@@ ases for the policies which must be fun@@ ded .
the Council of Ministers has already be@@ gu@@ n working on an committee , as its representative , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , has told us , and we in the European Parliament have created a temporary committee , which it is my hon@@ our to cha@@ ir , which has already produced a series of documents and within which our rapporteur , Mr B@@ ö@@ ge , is doing very considerable work on making Parliament &apos;s position coherent .
we are all , therefore , aware of the importance of this task , which must serve to establish the political priorities and define the budgetary resources available to the Union during 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
every@@ body knows - though I must remind you of it - that without the agreement of Parliament there will be no financial perspec@@ tives .
without the agreement of Parliament it will not be possible to reach an inter@@ institutional agreement which does not appear in the Treaty .
Parliament wishes to reach an agreement within the time limit laid down in the timetable , but it wants a good agreement , and in order to achieve one , certain issues must be clari@@ fied stra@@ i@@ gh@@ ta@@ way .
firstly , we need to know whether the current Commission offici@@ ally accep@@ ts the proposals of the out@@ going Commission .
it is true that you , Commissioner , have already told us in the meeting of the T@@ em@@ por@@ ary Committee on Policy C@@ hall@@ eng@@ es and Bud@@ getary Me@@ ans , that the Commission head@@ ed by Mr Barroso directly accep@@ ts the proposals of the out@@ going Commission .
shor@@ tly after@@ wards , however , lea@@ ks and comments have appe@@ ared in the media sugges@@ ting that the Commission intends , or at least accep@@ ts , not going as far as the proposals produced by the Prodi Commission .
this is the time for you , Commissioner , here in Parliament , in the abs@@ ence of the President of the Commission , form@@ ally to tell us , in your opinion , the level of resources Europe needs in order to fulfil its amb@@ itions .
it would also be good if you could explain to us which income structures you believe are most appropriate in order for the Union to be able to conf@@ ron@@ t its current and future needs .
secondly , it would also be a good thing for us to expl@@ or@@ e what would happen in the event that certain Member States prevent an agreement from being reached within the relevant time limit .
would the Commission then be prepared to provide for the trans@@ itional provisions necessary to ensure the continu@@ ity of mul@@ ti @-@ annual programmes in the abs@@ ence of a framework agreement on the financial perspec@@ tives ?
as you know , Parliament has already expressed its pre@@ ference with regard to the du@@ ration of these financial perspec@@ tives .
we believe that five years is prefer@@ able since it is more in line with the du@@ ration of the terms in office of Parliament and of the Commission .
Commissioner , Mr President , by creating a T@@ em@@ por@@ ary Committee on Policy C@@ hall@@ eng@@ es and Bud@@ getary Me@@ ans and ap@@ poin@@ ting its own President as chairman of that committee , which is not normal , this Parliament wis@@ hed to give a clear demonstra@@ tion of its interest and political commitment to a process which is so sensitive and essential to the future of Europe .
we know that we are facing some very important challenges .
how to fund the enlargement we have just carried out .
how to conf@@ ron@@ t the enlarg@@ ements which are on the hor@@ iz@@ on and which will un@@ doub@@ tedly take place within the framework of the future financial perspec@@ tives .
how to ensure that Europe &apos;s increasing role in the world is bac@@ ked up with sufficient economic resources .
how to realise the policies which will make Europe what we always call , when speaking of Lisbon , the most dyna@@ mic and competitive economy in the world .
all of this must be included in the budget , because what is not in the budget does not exist , as Fin@@ ance Ministers say .
the expression may be somewhat of an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation , but we know that , in order for certain things to exist , they must first appear in the bud@@ gets .
Commissioner , Mr President , the Barroso Commission has been confirmed by means of a very broad vote of confidence from this House .
this is the time for you to demonstrate that you are not simply medi@@ ators between Parliament and the Council , but that you are able to show strong political lead@@ ership .
the financial perspec@@ tives offer a great opportunity to demonstrate this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we set to work on the basis of the Commun@@ ication and the proposals from the Commission .
in order to be able to press on with our work , we do of course need answ@@ ers to the questions that this House &apos;s President has just addressed .
in fact , Commissioner , there are pl@@ enty of discussions and ru@@ m@@ ours a@@ foot , and perhaps today &apos;s debate will help clarify matters .
for example , you told a meeting of the T@@ em@@ por@@ ary Committee that the agriculture policy was a re@@ li@@ c of the n@@ ine@@ te@@ ent@@ h century .
if that is the case , why is there no proposal from the Commission to change it ?
or does it not after all contribute something to the Lisbon strategy and to sustain@@ ability , in view of the current state of play where decisions on agricultural reform are concerned ?
Commissioner Verheugen has said that , in order to make a success of Lisbon , we need more responsibility and greater commitment from the Member States , but we see it as also involving the question of added value for Europe , of whether Lisbon is meant to implement the Budget more vi@@ goro@@ us@@ ly , particularly in connection with the programmes that bring Europe added value , in research and the multi@@ annual education programmes .
then , we hear reports of internal discussions even at this early stage about the possibility of moving away from the 1.@@ 14 % , and then some@@ one pu@@ ts forward the idea that 1.@@ 0@@ 6 % , or 1.@@ 0@@ 7 % , would be a wor@@ ka@@ ble compromise , so let me , as rapporteur , make it perfectly clear that nobody in the other institutions should imag@@ ine that Parliament is prepared to negoti@@ ate bel@@ ow the mar@@ g@@ ins set as a network by Article 2@@ 7@@ 2 of the Treaty .
let me add that this is without taking account of the European Development Fund , which ad@@ ds another 0@@ .@@ 0@@ 3 % and has , for the first time , been included in the fig@@ ure of 1.@@ 14 % in the Commission proposal and hence also in the Budget .
Commissioner , you described a crisis situation fe@@ a@@ turing all the things that can happen if agreement fail@@ s to be achieved .
we want agreement , and that is why , yet again today , we insist on a mon@@ th@@ ly tr@@ ilo@@ gue capable of ensuring that difficult c@@ hap@@ ters are not left to be dealt with at the end of the procedure , but rather that issues of flexibility , du@@ ration of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive and many points of substance can be discussed in good time and considered join@@ tly as part of a permanent dialogue between the institutions .
. Mr President , I am sup@@ posed to say that offici@@ ally I am respon@@ ding on behalf of the Commission to four questions from Parliament , but I received a lot more .
I will try to answer them as well as giving the &apos; official &apos; response .
I must say at the out@@ set that in the Commission there are no internal discussions on c@@ eil@@ ings other than the official proposal that was presented to you and to the Council .
despite media ru@@ m@@ ours , this is not a subject for discussion in the Commission .
now the &apos; official &apos; response to the first question : does the new Commission endorse the structure of the new financial perspective ?
yes , the enlarged European Union fac@@ es new challenges and needs to meet new expectations .
we need to up@@ date the structure of our financial perspec@@ tives to better reflect these new priorities .
this enta@@ ils a new classi@@ fication of expenditure to give a new prof@@ ile for the Union &apos;s finan@@ ces .
this more limited number of expenditure head@@ ings reflec@@ ts the Union &apos;s main priorities , making them more visi@@ ble to European citizens and ra@@ tion@@ alis@@ ing expenditure accord@@ ingly .
this Commission endor@@ ses the same priorities , i@@ .@@ e@@ . trans@@ form@@ ing the European Union into a dyna@@ mic knowledge @-@ based economy , pursu@@ ing greater cohesion in the context of the enlargement of the European Union , preser@@ ving and manag@@ ing the European Union &apos;s natural resources - including agriculture , fisheries and the environment - and developing the area of freedom , security and justice and the role of the Union as a global part@@ ner .
the proposals before us reflect the needs of the Union , firstly because these priorities identi@@ fy and represent a common consensus about where Europe must inten@@ si@@ fy its actions .
secondly , the proposed structure also off@@ ers a real step towards simp@@ li@@ fication and ra@@ tion@@ alisation , which was welcomed by Parliament in its resolution of 22 April .
finally , the proposals have already allowed both the Council and Parliament to have substantial discussions and prepare the ground for an agreement next year .
the second question : does the new Commission endorse the du@@ ration of the financial programmes which will com@@ mit the next Commission and the next European Parliament ?
let me assure you that the Commission is fully aware of Parliament &apos;s position - which was also expressed in the resolution of 22 April - in which it calls for a financial framework to be established for a period of only five years .
however , we loo@@ ked into this question and concluded that for the next program@@ ming period , se@@ ven years would be the best solution because the c@@ eil@@ ing for market @-@ related expenditure and direct payments - in agriculture , for example - has already been fi@@ xed by the European Council until 20@@ 13 .
a se@@ ven @-@ year timetable also max@@ im@@ ises the benefits of long @-@ term planning , in particular in cohesion policies .
the third question : does the new Commission endorse all the proposals in what is known as the &apos; Prodi package &apos; , or does it consider that it should be read@@ jus@@ ted and , if so , on which issues ?
as I said earlier , we endorse all the proposals .
the Commission stands by the package proposed earlier this year .
we do not call it by that name : it is the Commission &apos;s proposal and we endorse that proposal , namely the proposed financial framework , compl@@ em@@ ented by a series of legislative and non @-@ legislative proposals adopted between February and September 2004 .
they have been submitted to the Council and to various committees of this Parliament .
the Commission fores@@ e@@ es the adoption of the remain@@ ing necessary proposals early next year .
the political project which under@@ p@@ ins the financial perspec@@ tives is based on a number of well @-@ established priorities on which a consensus already exists between the European institutions on the number of commitments already made , for example on agriculture , enlargement , Lisbon , et@@ c .
building on this , the Commission is now also preparing its five @-@ year strategic objectives , which will be presented to Parliament by the end of January 2005 .
the Commission believes that the proposals constitute a good basis for an agreement for the next financial perspective .
to reach such an agreement the Commission will be taking an active part in the discussions and negotiations that will take place with the European Parliament and the Council .
in this context , the Commission will take fully into account the key points of the discussion and will s@@ tri@@ ve to reach a political agreement by the end of June 2005 .
the four@@ th question : is the Commission ready to take account of other institutions &apos; priorities ?
the answer is yes .
the Commission will of course take careful account of Parliament &apos;s position in relation to the initiatives already proposed and in view of those that will arri@@ ve in 2005 .
the package is already based on a very broad consensus about where actions are required , in the light of European Parliament resolutions , European Council conclusions and , indeed , discussions within the Commission .
the forthcoming discussions on the Commission &apos;s strategic objectives are directly linked to this , and the Commission atta@@ ches considerable importance to the establishment of common priorities .
the Constitution will mean a co@@ di@@ fied multi@@ annual financial framework , and I would like a common vision for the next program@@ ming period to be our first step on this path .
I would like to make two brief points in fin@@ alis@@ ing the official answer to the question tabled .
first , I wish to remind you of what President Barroso has said in this House : the European Union needs to mat@@ ch its political amb@@ ition with its financial resources .
increased spending has been proposed because , with enlargement and with a demand for action in new areas , it was ine@@ vi@@ table .
we cannot have a larg@@ er European Union with less money .
secondly , I under@@ line the Commission &apos;s strong commitment to the need to respect the target of a political agreement by June 2005 and the adoption of legislative proposals by the end of that year .
the Irish and Netherlands presid@@ encies have achieved considerable progress during their respec@@ tive terms in the Council .
we all need to susta@@ in the mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and actively support the efforts of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to achieve political agreement by the end of its term .
the Commission wishes the presidency well in the task of achieving the goals which will be useful for all European citizens .
. thank you , Mr President , thank you , Commissioner , for the first response you have just given us .
in so doing , you have confirmed what you said to our T@@ em@@ por@@ ary Committee and the Committee on Budgets .
in short , I have to say that your response does not al@@ together satis@@ fy us since it amounts to saying that the new Commission is adopting the previous Commission &apos;s proposals without examin@@ ing them in detail , and that it believes that the b@@ all is now in Parliament &apos;s and the European Council &apos;s cour@@ ts .
we are in fact looking to the Commission to show not the pas@@ sive attitude of a medi@@ a@@ tor but the lead@@ ership of a political execu@@ tive strong in the confidence mas@@ sively expressed by Parliament s@@ car@@ c@@ ely a month ago , to quo@@ te President B@@ or@@ re@@ l@@ l .
it is all the more necessary and urgent that the new Commission should adopt a strong position now that initial s@@ oun@@ dings of all concerned in the Council have re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that , for the first time , some Member States are proposing to cut the rela@@ tive amount of the present budget , as Mr B@@ ö@@ ge said .
thus , the Commissioner for industry is saying pub@@ lic@@ ly that there are currently 27 priorities for the Lisbon strategy and that they should be comb@@ ined into one .
will that not be reflec@@ ted in the budget ?
you say there has been no debate in the Commission over the proposed amount for the c@@ eil@@ ing of own resources .
when will that debate take place ?
in what areas would financial sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es be in@@ es@@ capable for the Commission if this resources c@@ eil@@ ing were not ob@@ tained ?
can the proposals made by Mr Prodi reason@@ ably be finan@@ ced on the basis of the present system of European Union financing , or does the Commission believe that negotiations should cover income as well as expenditure ?
finally , what prov@@ isi@@ onal measures should be taken , and when , if , as seems highly likely , the Council fail@@ s to reach a consensus before the process of rati@@ fying the Constitution is comple@@ ted ?
as you have remin@@ ded us , President Barroso says we cannot have more Europe for less money .
how much money does the policy proposed by President Barroso require ?
. Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking today in my capacity as my group &apos;s co@@ ord@@ ina@@ tor in the Committee on Regional Development , which has the second larg@@ est individual budget to deal with , as the budget for cohesion and structural policy , with a 35 % share , is second only in siz@@ e to the budget for agriculture .
al@@ ong@@ side the tasks we have to per@@ form in dealing with the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive , the speci@@ alist committees and most especially the Committee on Regional Development have the task of preparing the relevant Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions for each Fund for the new financial period of 2007 to 20@@ 13 .
I see the an@@ ch@@ or@@ ing of this cohesion and structural policy , including in our Constitution , on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions , as creating very modern political appro@@ ac@@ hes to the implementation of a European policy for the public &apos;s benefit .
what we in the Committee on Regional Development need for our work is a reli@@ able statement and foun@@ d@@ ation , and both I and my group believe that only the Prodi proposal can fulfil that role .
I will per@@ mit myself the asi@@ de that I get the impression that regional policy appears to be used by everyone as a sort of pi@@ g@@ gy ban@@ k .
the Council does it by attemp@@ ting to get a perc@@ enta@@ ge accepted while a majority of its members want to make cu@@ ts because agriculture has already ground to a hal@@ t .
having seen the way you , Commissioner , deal with the Committee on Budgets and the temporary committee on the political challenges and Budget resources for the enlarged EU between 2007 and 20@@ 13 , I can say that the Commission does too , calling ever more frequ@@ ently for a Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
I get the impression that the second half of that sen@@ tence is mis@@ sing : &apos; whether that Per@@ spec@@ tive be good or bad . &quot;
that is something we cannot affor@@ d .
the attempt is made ever more frequ@@ ently to use structural policy measures to fund other things ; the example I would give is the way in which the funding of Na@@ tur@@ a 2000 is being remo@@ ved from the environmental sector and mo@@ ved to structural policy .
let me also say , though , that regional policy was necessary in the old EU of 15 Member States , and it is necessary in the new one , with its 25 .
we need efficiency , but we cannot affor@@ d it to happen that d@@ ras@@ tic cu@@ ts in this area pun@@ ish a large part of the population for something that we all wanted and that the European Union always has made tan@@ gible and acc@@ es@@ sible to millions of citizens .
Commissioner , you said that the new@@ s@@ paper@@ s report only fail@@ u@@ res .
in Germany , we have a saying to the effect that there is no smo@@ ke without fir@@ e .
that is why debates about 1.@@ 0@@ 5 % or 1.@@ 0@@ 6 % are not help@@ ful .
let me remind you that the European Union has always worked well when the Commission has strength@@ ened Parliament and vice ver@@ sa .
we can negoti@@ ate well together , whether the Council is on the same side or our op@@ pon@@ ent .
Mr President , we in the Group of the A@@ lli@@ ance of Liber@@ als and Democrats for Europe were very pleased to see that the Prodi Commission atta@@ ched such great importance to the Lisbon objectives when it presented its draft financial estima@@ tes .
we also note that improved competitiveness and increased growth in Europe are among the things that are genuinely high on the Barroso Commission &apos;s agenda and have been so right from the start .
that is something we have also seen following the clear obser@@ vations made by Mr Barroso today here in plenary .
I therefore think it only natural to ask the Commission whether it will face the implications of its shar@@ p focus on the Lisbon objectives and amen@@ d the Prodi Commission &apos;s proposal .
is there any@@ where it will alloc@@ ate more resources to improve competitiveness and to create increased growth and more jobs ?
are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework ?
is there to be more focus upon growth @-@ ori@@ ented policy areas ?
are there things to be dis@@ pen@@ sed with ?
what we have here is a large complex of legislation and proposals .
I appreciate that what exists at present forms the point of de@@ par@@ ture , but it might however be interesting to hear whether there is anything to which more w@@ eight is to be given and whether there are any negative priorities .
if there are to be priorities , where are the cu@@ t@@ bac@@ ks to be made first ?
when we in Parliament debate the financial estima@@ tes , we do not focus upon an expenditure c@@ eil@@ ing , as some countries in the Council do .
we do not wish to become ti@@ ed up in the Council &apos;s b@@ lin@@ ker@@ ed discussions of 1 % or whatever .
I am pleased that , in this House today , you have said that perc@@ enta@@ ges are not being discussed in the Commission either - at any rate , not at the moment .
we must not talk about qu@@ ant@@ ity , but quality .
Parliament must therefore call upon the Commission to preser@@ ve a sto@@ ical cal@@ m and first of all discuss the content of EU policy .
we can discuss budget c@@ eil@@ ings subsequ@@ ently .
we now have a uni@@ que opportunity to consider what we want , as well as what we want the future EU to look like between 2007 and 20@@ 13 , and that is an opportunity we must not waste .
as far as my own group is concerned , it is important to have the focus on research , to strengthen the common research programmes and perhaps even to consider creating a fund for basic research that can strengthen research in future technologies such as n@@ an@@ o@@ technology , allowing the EU also to be a key pla@@ yer .
we must consider ob@@ tain@@ ing increased ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king of our univers@@ ities in Europe in terms of a fair compar@@ is@@ on of who does what best on a cross @-@ border basis , and we must create heal@@ thy competition .
we must look at our training programmes and see whether they take account of needs in the new Member States where , for example , many stud@@ ents cannot affor@@ d to travel and learn new things .
again , it may be asked : &apos; have we ob@@ tained the correct focus in what we now have ? &quot;
this , clearly , is the debate in which we in Parliament shall eng@@ age and on which we shall work .
that being said , the big b@@ attle will clearly centre upon regional policy .
it is regional policy that is the difficult area .
when you atten@@ ded the hear@@ ings here in Parliament , you were coura@@ ge@@ ous enough to express the view that some of the new countries were probably able to ab@@ sor@@ b more than 4 % of gro@@ s@@ s domestic product .
I shall be interested to hear whether you still hold that view , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ ite , once you are Commissioner .
in this area too , we shall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to create quality rather than just look to qu@@ ant@@ ity .
what we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is therefore crucial , and we appreciate , of course , that this is quite a difficult subject , including for the Council .
I hope that we can obtain a constructive dialogue and a mon@@ th@@ ly tri@@ alogue , for it is important for us to go on discussing these matters .
it is quite a package that we have here .
. Mr President , the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance regards the Commission proposals as a sound basis for negotiations between Parliament and the Council .
I understand that you now want to refer to it as the Barroso package instead of the Prodi package .
that is fine with me . after all , I am concerned with content .
I very much welcome 1.@@ 14 % of the G@@ DP for investments in the Lisbon strategy , for money for an economic inc@@ en@@ tive in the po@@ ore@@ r regions and for reinfor@@ cing the EU &apos;s role in the world .
my group is also critical of your plans , though .
after all , the future gener@@ ations , our children , appear to be getting a rou@@ gh deal .
investments in renew@@ able , sustainable energy sources are ina@@ dequate , which is d@@ et@@ r@@ imen@@ tal to the environment and is also fe@@ eding depend@@ ency on all kin@@ ds of du@@ b@@ ious reg@@ imes in countries where oil flo@@ ws in ab@@ und@@ ance .
there is no separate fund for Na@@ tur@@ a 2000 , there are in@@ sufficient resources for improving the rec@@ ep@@ tion of refugees in the region and the increase in funds for culture and exchange programmes for young people is too small .
we would like to promote Europe a little less and ensure that people experience Europe a little more .
so , it is 1.@@ 14 % &apos; plu@@ s , &quot; as far as my group is concerned .
that is , indeed , quite different from what many Member States say .
some of those Member States still apply the 1 % man@@ tra .
mean@@ while , they have s@@ ne@@ a@@ kil@@ y become more ra@@ dical , because I no@@ tic@@ ed that they are mean@@ while applying 1 % in the commitment appropriations instead of in the payments , which have trad@@ iti@@ on@@ ally always been somewhat lower .
that would mean that up to 20@@ 13 , we would have a budget that is lower than we have at present , while the European Union has enlarged .
all the while , we are bus@@ y making lis@@ ts of amb@@ itions .
the Member States do not all follow the same view .
the cu@@ ts in agriculture and the structural funds are , in fact , very contro@@ versi@@ al .
a child will therefore realise that those will mainly remain in@@ tac@@ t in the major negotiations .
where will the cu@@ ts be made ?
in the funds for research , development , human rights , the environment , external policy and culture .
precisely those areas that are close to people &apos;s hear@@ ts and that are given a visi@@ ble added value if they are implemented at European level .
a budget that is bor@@ ne out of euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism will only feed that euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism even more .
in that way , we will re@@ tain a Europe that is mainly foc@@ used on the market and the currency , and that is head@@ ing absolutely the wrong way .
I agree with Mr Lam@@ ass@@ our@@ e , who states that we need more active lead@@ ership from the Commission .
if we really want - and that is what we up@@ hold , after all - that Europe is a Europe that is united in diversity , we will need to actively inv@@ est in this .
I would also like to call on the Commission to use us , because they do not know our position yet .
we may be argu@@ ing in favour of 1.@@ 5 % , because we are far more ambitious than the Member States .
with 1.@@ 14 % , the Commission will therefore be t@@ reading a m@@ iddle path .
I therefore hope that you will gain the strategic in@@ si@@ ght to dis@@ pe@@ l all the smo@@ ke that is continu@@ ously being created and which we think may be indic@@ ative of a small fir@@ e - you may have dro@@ pped 1.@@ 0@@ 7 % some@@ where in sec@@ ret after all .
we urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe .
show your lead@@ ership .
prove it in the negotiations , for that is the only way of creating a Europe that is not the old Europe of the market and of the currency , but a Europe that takes people and the environment to heart .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the Union &apos;s Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive ought to be a debate on the future of Europe .
the dec@@ ade 2004 @-@ 20@@ 13 will be character@@ ised by the accession of 12 new countries .
the Union needs to decide whether it is going to promote the uni@@ fication of Europe and equality of opportunity , or whether it is to create div@@ isions and he@@ i@@ gh@@ ten ine@@ qu@@ alities .
research establis@@ h@@ men@@ t@@ sci@@ vi@@ c society , ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ s and others ought to contribute to the debate on the future of Europe , not just politicians .
unfortunately , the Union is not in favour of a public debate of this kind .
instead , the future of Europe is being decided in remo@@ te offic@@ es .
bureauc@@ rats and politicians are taking the decisions on tasks and resources , and they also decide how to alloc@@ ate funds and on the amounts involved .
in the mean@@ time , Parliament is bus@@ y deb@@ ating min@@ or issues together with the possibility of broad@@ ening its competences .
even if Parliament &apos;s competences were to be increased , there will be no time to prepare our own draft budget tac@@ kl@@ ing two major issues , namely how to speed up the p@@ ace of economic development and how to reduce the differences between ric@@ her and po@@ ore@@ r regions of Europe .
a new budget is required , however , as the Commission &apos;s draft run@@ s counter to the no@@ tion of solidarity and is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to spe@@ eding up the development of Europe .
this is true both of the proposals and the su@@ ms referred to there@@ in .
the best example I could mention is the fact that the countries of the old Fi@@ f@@ teen , which are all rich , are to receive in exc@@ ess of EUR 19@@ 4 billion from the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund , whilst the ten new Member States and Romania and Bulgar@@ ia are only due to receive EUR 1@@ 80 billion .
it is also worth re@@ memb@@ ering that a significant propor@@ tion of the second su@@ m will end up in the ric@@ her countries , in the form of order and of payments to advis@@ ers and experts .
in our view , the European Parliament ought to come up with its own draft budget .
this should either be undertaken in opposition to the Commission and the Council , or in cooperation with them .
this budget would be based on three principles .
the first of these is that the greater the Union , the greater the budget .
the second is that the greater the differences in development , the more funding should go to less @-@ developed regions and Member States .
the third principle is that tax and investment conc@@ es@@ sions are required , as are other appropriate measures for the benefit of less @-@ developed regions and countries .
Mr President , if you perhaps try to explain what this is all about to a young f@@ em@@ ale citizen of the European Union and to a m@@ iddle @-@ aged m@@ ale one , do you not ine@@ vi@@ tably end up making compar@@ is@@ ons with the So@@ vi@@ et Union and tell@@ ing them that we are dealing with a se@@ ven @-@ year plan rather than a five @-@ year one ?
is it not the case that the decision @-@ making ma@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y is very much compar@@ able to that which then oper@@ ated in M@@ os@@ co@@ w , with the difference that lob@@ by@@ ists are now involved ?
and if you turn it around and tell them that you understand the European public &apos;s need for money , and then consider the priorities and say : right , I really do want to double the education budget ; I do want to double the research budget - how , then , my de@@ ar Commissioner , do you make that transparent ?
how do you set it out ?
if you do not manage to make it clear what we need all this money for , public support will certainly be den@@ ied to you , and Europe will s@@ l@@ ide even closer to the br@@ in@@ k of disaster .
the President of the European Commission made certain comments last week - and a colleague has pointed this out today - to the effect that more Europe cannot be created with less money .
today , Commissioner , you have confirmed that the current Commission is maintaining the proposal of the previous Commission .
I would add - to those people who are constantly claim@@ ing to be Europe@@ an@@ ists - that less money means the ren@@ a@@ tion@@ alisation of the cohesion policy , which is e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to less Europe .
nevertheless , the Commission will probably soon propose amendments depen@@ ding on how the negotiations develop .
and I am sure that the Commission &apos;s proposals will be based on the principle of balance .
I would , therefore , like to ask the European Commission to review the aspects of its proposal which could lead to un@@ fair results because of their lack of balance , Commissioner .
because I believe that to a certain extent that is what is happening at this point in the negotiations .
in order to provide material for this debate - either endor@@ sing it or rejec@@ ting it - I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the information available to it on the impact on the fif@@ teen Member States of the costs of enlargement - which , of course , is absolutely essential - because the intention to pay for the conver@@ g@@ ence requirements of our new partners at the expen@@ se of solidarity with the countries and regions of the existing States would be prof@@ oun@@ dly anti @-@ European and har@@ m@@ ful to our shared future .
I shall end by expres@@ sing my support for the European Commission , provided that it maintain@@ s the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Policy as a fundamental pillar of European integration .
Mr President , the Prodi multi@@ annual financial package is now referred to as the Barroso multi@@ annual financial package , as long as it is based on 1.@@ 14 % , although to me , 1 % , 1.@@ 14 % , 1.@@ 24 % ... is not of the ess@@ ence .
the real debate is about the question whether we are prepared to actually pay for the political priorities included in the new European Constitution .
it is a case of putting your money where your mouth is , therefore .
it is precisely in that area that our citizens have seen European lead@@ ership fail too often .
I have six obser@@ vations to make .
the first is that Europe must be a social Europe , but in most countries , private and public investments in education and research are tra@@ il@@ ing behind .
the cu@@ ts are har@@ s@@ h at 3 % , but there is not enough room for ex@@ tra investments in research and education .
the g@@ ol@@ den rule is not an option in the Stability Pact .
secondly , we are not prepared to make the real s@@ wit@@ ch from agricultural subsi@@ dy to rural and environmental policy for the sa@@ ke of internal social cohesion and our priority , which is knowledge .
this would create actual room for knowledge innovation in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side and in the ur@@ ban areas , with priority being given to the ten new acc@@ eding countries .
in Europe , we say in the Constitution that we want Europe to have a central role in the world .
at present , one in five people across the g@@ lo@@ be have no access to education or health care .
we talk about mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives and about 20@@ 15 , but what we see are , in fact , levels of spending by the EU Member States and by the EU itself that are far bel@@ ow pa@@ r in this respect , despite resolutions by this House .
we want the Commission &apos;s new plans and the Commission communication about development policy to be given priority in January , with broad bac@@ king from Parliament , for these mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives in He@@ ading 4 : 35 % for the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives and 20 % for basic education and basic health care .
Mr B@@ or@@ re@@ l@@ l was right in saying that if it is not in the budget , then it does not exist .
that , then , is why we want it .
the four@@ th is that bad European lead@@ ership is at its most pro@@ min@@ ent in external policy , with major decisions , but no funding .
we want a Middle East policy over@@ night , and we get the funding from the budget to fight poverty in Africa .
we want a new neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy .
all well and good , but the money is once again taken from the budget to fight poverty in Asia and Central America .
each objective deser@@ ves its own budget .
we should not have to shi@@ ft funding around .
the fif@@ th is that we want national fraud and accoun@@ tant cer@@ ti@@ fication bure@@ a@@ us in order to guarantee s@@ wi@@ ft and fraud @-@ pro@@ of implementation and subsequ@@ ent approval in each country .
we are still far too v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able on that sc@@ or@@ e .
si@@ x@@ th@@ ly and finally , the public wants to see that each country makes a fair contribution to the comb@@ ined European budget according to its own capacity .
if that is 1 % or 1.@@ 15 % , so be it ; as long as it is done according to the capacity and the means of each country . equal shar@@ es .
that applies to the Netherlands as well as to other countries .
only then will we receive the support of our European citizens for a truly serious policy .
Mr President , the European Union &apos;s new financial framework is probably the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est issue that Parliament has to resolve this term .
it is not just the v@@ olu@@ me of EU funding that is at issue , but what future action is to consis@@ t of in general .
the first serious dis@@ agreement among the Member States concerns the extent of financing .
the Commission &apos;s proposal is based on the payment appropriations , which on average would amount to 1.@@ 14 % of G@@ DP .
the proposal by six countries for a c@@ eil@@ ing on expenditure of 1 % is a str@@ ing@@ ent one .
it does not even reflect the extent of next year &apos;s budget , although the trans@@ ition phase for the new Member States is only just starting .
a call has now been made for joint li@@ ability .
will it end when it is a matter of money ?
another problem is the call for a re@@ b@@ ate on contributions by the larg@@ est net contribu@@ tors , known as the &apos; gener@@ alised correc@@ tion mechanism . &quot;
that does not seem fair , as these same Member States also benefit most from the single market .
the Commission &apos;s proposal pu@@ ts great emphasis on improving employment and competitiveness .
in my opinion , that is absolutely the right focus .
there have already been enough resolutions .
industry and enterpris@@ e cannot succeed if there is no serious research and development work .
on the other hand , research is so expen@@ sive that no Member State on its own can compet@@ e , for example , with the United States of America or Jap@@ an .
for that reason , European cooperation is needed .
we already have examples of this in the fields of space technology and partic@@ le research .
the creation of new research programmes must be based on the pre@@ mis@@ e that they will focus on projects that call for Europe @-@ wide cooperation .
they must not be allowed to become bureauc@@ ratic Structural Funds programmes , the like of which we have now .
there must also be more substantial production of training cour@@ ses in connection with programmes of research .
it is very important that we should agree on the future financial framework next year .
then we would avoid the sort of m@@ ess we saw at the start of the Agenda 2000 programme , which was dela@@ yed , resul@@ ting in serious dela@@ ys in the draf@@ ting of several programmes .
Mr President , in my one minu@@ te of speaking time I shall focus on regional policy and specifically the risk that there may not be a regional policy for some states after the conclusion of the negotiations on the financial perspec@@ tives .
Commissioner , I welcome your commitment to the original Commission proposals , although we have heard from other sources that the Commission - some@@ where - is preparing for alternative out@@ comes .
I would ask you to consider publis@@ hing what analysis you have carried out of alternative out@@ comes of the financial perspec@@ tives .
that would be particularly help@@ ful to the debate within our own nation @-@ states .
my own country , the UK - as opposed to my own nation , S@@ cot@@ land - is putting forward a position that is as un@@ constructive as it is un@@ clear .
an objective analysis of what the UK position would mean in terms of nu@@ mb@@ ers and political ra@@ mi@@ fications would be a hu@@ g@@ ely help@@ ful contribution to the debate .
the UK contribution to the debate thus far , with its position on the UK re@@ b@@ ate , the statis@@ tical effect , the nation@@ alisation of structural funds and the lim@@ iting of the EU budget to one per cent of G@@ N@@ I is nothing less than a cu@@ mula@@ tive act of van@@ d@@ alism .
an objective analysis of this contribution from the Commission would be a very help@@ ful deb@@ ating too@@ l for us in the United Kingdom .
Madam President , the long @-@ term financial perspective is an important document .
it will place a restric@@ tion on the annual bud@@ gets right up until 20@@ 13 .
this will be crucial to cho@@ ices of areas and to how great a commitment the EU can assu@@ me during the next se@@ ven to eight years .
in recent days , the Commission has presented its view of the long @-@ term budget .
the new Commission has taken over the old Commission &apos;s proposal , or what is known as the Prodi package .
this means a significant rise in expenditure .
in the case of some countries , it is a question of a 50 % real increase .
that is something I find unacceptable .
my view is that the new Commission should have lis@@ tened more closely to the views of the six larg@@ est net contribu@@ tors .
they deman@@ ded that the financial perspective should include an expenditure c@@ eil@@ ing of 1 % of gro@@ s@@ s national income .
there should be a c@@ eil@@ ing not only for payments , but also for commitments .
it is not acceptable , as the Commission proposes , to allow the commitments to pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate to 1.@@ 27 % of gro@@ s@@ s national income .
that is the up@@ per limit that the Members have undertaken to pay .
after 20@@ 13 , there will be no way of ex@@ pan@@ ding over and above general economic growth unless all the countries agree to give up their right of ve@@ to .
that is not something I believe they will do .
the Commission therefore proposes that the EU introduce some form of EU tax .
we are defin@@ i@@ tely and strongly opposed to the EU &apos;s being given its own right of taxation .
without monitoring by the individual Member States , there is no limit upon the EU &apos;s amb@@ ition to gro@@ w into a feder@@ al super@@ state .
each Member State should allow its parliament to vote on the EU &apos;s financial perspective before the Council of Ministers takes its decision so that the decision is not taken sec@@ re@@ tly but open@@ ly and clearly , with people aware of the financial commitments they will assu@@ me .
so that the national parliaments might be provided with a sound basis for their decisions , the Commission should prepare a draft alternative perspective contained within the 1 % expenditure c@@ eil@@ ing we have proposed .
there is otherwise a pal@@ pa@@ ble risk of the Commission &apos;s ultimately being forced into ill thought @-@ out cu@@ t@@ bac@@ ks in expenditure and commitments , instead of having properly considered prior@@ it@@ ising that makes it possible to keep the promis@@ es made to the new countries .
the debate will now be suspen@@ ded and will resu@@ me at 9 p.@@ m .
the next item is Ques@@ tion T@@ ime , with questions to the Commission ( B@@ 6 @-@ 13@@ 6 / 2004 ) .
.
the recent case of con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation demonstrated that the European Community already has the necessary integrated legislation to manage such situations in a su@@ itable manner .
that is why the question of additional measures is not being raised , at least not for the moment , the question being the need to apply existing measures correc@@ tly .
programmes for monitoring dio@@ x@@ ins and P@@ C@@ B@@ s in food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s are applied throughout the European Union .
Τ@@ h@@ ese programmes have allowed the Dutch authorities to identi@@ fy the con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation and take su@@ itable measures to ex@@ termin@@ ate its source .
there are monitoring and identi@@ fication systems for identi@@ fying the under@@ ta@@ k@@ ings and li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck un@@ its which may have been con@@ ta@@ min@@ ated .
in order to prevent the introduction of pos@@ sibly con@@ ta@@ min@@ ated food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s into the food cha@@ in , the necessary contain@@ ment measures have been taken for these ins@@ ta@@ ll@@ ations .
the early war@@ ning system for food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s oper@@ ated with particular efficiency as regards the exchange of information between the competent authorities .
the adoption by the European Union of up@@ per limits for dio@@ x@@ ins played a primary role in the management of this case of con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation .
it is indeed a legal too@@ l for taking decisions which safeguard the protection of public health .
however , we must ad@@ mit that it is not possible to totally exclu@@ de the possibility of con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of the food cha@@ in .
the risk will always remain , which is why we have adopted the measures needed for us to identi@@ fy and combat such risks .
it is , however , of im@@ men@@ se importance to the protection of public health that con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation be identi@@ fied in the early sta@@ ges through monitoring and for us to have rules which prevent and aver@@ t further con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of the food cha@@ in .
current Community legislation already includes such provisions .
nonetheless , the case of con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation which we are discussing today demonstra@@ tes the need to evalu@@ ate the safety not only of the ing@@ redi@@ ents of food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s , but also of the products which are used directly or in@@ directly in the prepar@@ ation of food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s .
food safety legislation sti@@ pu@@ la@@ tes that food and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff manufac@@ tur@@ ers are responsible for product safety .
the Commission will continue to emphasise this obligation to manufac@@ tur@@ ers and to monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent national agencies in order to safeguard compliance with current requirements .
finally , as far as lan@@ d@@ fi@@ lls are concerned , Community legislation has been adopted in order to ensure that lan@@ d@@ fi@@ lls are designed and oper@@ ated in a way which does not je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e human health or the environment .
- Madam President , Commissioner , the necessary to@@ ols for manag@@ ing risks and safe@@ guar@@ ding public health are , on the one hand , the adoption of maximum limits for dio@@ x@@ ins in fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff substances , fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s and food at strict but fe@@ asi@@ ble levels which will become stric@@ ter as time goes by and , on the other hand , the ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment of responsibility at all sta@@ ges of the food cha@@ in at which dio@@ x@@ ins are identi@@ fied .
however , the wea@@ k link in the cha@@ in for the success of this endeav@@ our are the control mechanisms , especially in the fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s sector , where the link with public health is not directly perc@@ eiv@@ ed by citizens and awareness at production level is lower than with food .
this has also been prov@@ en by the fact that the ro@@ ot cause of recent major food problems has been dio@@ x@@ ins in fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s .
what action do you intend to take to strengthen and for@@ ti@@ fy the existing model of fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff control mechanisms so that controls at both European level and at the level of Member States are more efficient ?
.
I should like to add that , as far as up@@ per limits on dio@@ x@@ ins are concerned , they have already been set and there are strict standards .
at the same time , emphasis has been placed throughout the food cha@@ in not only on the final product of fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff@@ s , but also on the production mechanism and , for this reason , the instruments used for production will also be contro@@ lled .
I should also like to inform the honourable Member that we shall soon be adopting a regulation on fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stu@@ ff hy@@ gi@@ ene with the objective of la@@ ying down strict rules and the critical steps in the production process at which all hy@@ gi@@ ene rules will need to be adopted and I think that this will address the honourable Member &apos;s concerns .
. Madam President , the E@@ mis@@ sions Tra@@ ding Directive does not contain any provisions relating to administrative char@@ ges .
the application and level of such char@@ ges are therefore matters for the national governments .
we know that Member States have adopted different appro@@ ac@@ hes to char@@ ging for the issue of per@@ m@@ its under Directive 9@@ 6 / 6@@ 1 / EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control .
the authorities responsible for issu@@ ing per@@ m@@ its inc@@ ur costs , and each Member State is able to decide how it wants to finance those costs .
the Commission does not therefore have any estima@@ tes of the total level of administrative char@@ ges imposed on CO@@ 2 em@@ it@@ ters .
I would also like to say that I am standing in for Mr D@@ im@@ as , who sen@@ ds his a@@ pol@@ og@@ ies because he is atten@@ ding the Conference of Par@@ ties to the United Nations Convention on C@@ lim@@ ate C@@ han@@ ge .
as you know , it is a very important conference and he has asked me to stand in for him .
thank you , Commissioner .
would you not agree , though , that differ@@ ing administrative char@@ ges consider@@ ably distor@@ t the internal market , and that this lead@@ s to var@@ ying competition conditions in individual Member States ?
would you also agree that , in certain Member States , the administrative char@@ ges are signific@@ antly higher than the administrative expenditure actually inc@@ ur@@ red , and that it may be necessary for the Commission to make improvements here to safeguard the internal market ?
. these char@@ ges may var@@ y between Member States and be ab@@ sent in some cases .
but this is no different from other tax@@ es and char@@ ges that var@@ y between Member States and have implications for companies .
in the end , it is a political decision for each Member State to take as to whether it wants to finance administrative cu@@ ts like this through the general budget , or via direct char@@ ges .
since the question of char@@ ges for issu@@ ing gre@@ en@@ house gas emis@@ sion per@@ m@@ its is not within the Commission &apos;s competence , the Commission has no over@@ view of how much each Member State currently char@@ ges for issu@@ ing gre@@ en@@ house gas emis@@ sion per@@ m@@ its under the E@@ mis@@ sions Tra@@ ding Directive .
the review of the E@@ mis@@ sions Tra@@ ding Directive will start early in 2005 .
it will be a major sta@@ keh@@ ol@@ der sur@@ ve@@ y and will cover a broad range of issues , including the effect of the scheme on the ex@@ tra @-@ Community competitiveness of European companies .
Commissioner , emis@@ sion trading cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates are a very important aspect of the European Union &apos;s meeting its Kyoto objectives .
it seems to me very un@@ satisfactory that you are not able to inform the Member of the current state of play as regards each individual Member State .
will the Commission , in moving towards a review in 2005 , sur@@ ve@@ y the 25 Member States to establish what is the existing practice and ensure that a level playing field is created post @-@ 2005 ?
. as I said , the review of the emissions trading directive will start at the beginning of 2005 .
it will be a major sta@@ keh@@ ol@@ der sur@@ ve@@ y and will cover a broad range of issues .
I can forward your question to my colleagues and perhaps ask them to carry out a study so that we can compar@@ e the situation in each country .
it seems reasonable to me to have this information but I repeat that taxation and char@@ ges are not the competence of our Commission .
it is up to each Member State to decide the level of char@@ ges and taxation , as is the case for other products .
. the Commission is well aware of the problem of pi@@ racy , particularly in its most recent and exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated form via the Internet .
I fully share the honourable Member &apos;s view that this p@@ hen@@ omen@@ on is very dama@@ ging to the cultural indus@@ tries and I am determined to do the ut@@ most to get pi@@ racy levels as low as possible .
the Commission established a high @-@ level group on dig@@ ital rights management systems in March 2004 , as part of the e@@ Europe 2005 A@@ ction P@@ l@@ an .
the high @-@ level group &apos;s final report , presented on 8 July , reflec@@ ts a consensus on basic principles and recommendations for future actions in three areas , one of which is the mi@@ gration to legitimate services .
encouraging consumers to use legitimate on@@ line services is fundamental to the creation of a th@@ ri@@ ving e @-@ content market .
the dig@@ ital rights management systems will play an essential part , enab@@ ling new business mo@@ del@@ s and preventing un@@ author@@ ised use .
recommendations included actively promoting awareness among consumers of legitimate alternative offer@@ ings and the need to create consumer confidence .
regarding the situation outside the EU borders , also addressed by the honourable Member , on 10 November 2004 the Commission adopted a strategy for the en@@ for@@ cement of intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty rights in third countries .
this strategy s@@ ets the guidelines for the coming years towards a reduction of the level of intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty rights viol@@ ations taking place beyond the EU borders .
over and above technical cooperation and assistance , en@@ for@@ cement , regulatory implementation and bilateral and multila@@ teral monitoring , the Commission will fos@@ ter awareness @-@ ra@@ ising of users and consumers in third countries and support the creation of public @-@ private part@@ ner@@ ships for en@@ for@@ cement .
there are a number of programmes that also cover intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty rights and include awareness and education : for example , EC@@ A@@ P , which is an intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty programme for the A@@ SE@@ A@@ N countries ; the Coton@@ ou Agreement for the African , Car@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an and P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic countries , and the CA@@ R@@ D@@ S programme for the countries of the Balkans .
thank you , Commissioner , for that answer .
the point is that all those measures are perfectly val@@ id and , as you expla@@ ined , deal with all the different aspects of protecting intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty .
the specific problem I tried to raise is whether the Commission will focus particularly on the area where Member States have fe@@ wer instruments to deal with this , show@@ ing what is behind the protection of intell@@ ec@@ tual proper@@ ty and ra@@ ising awareness among citizens .
this is probably one of the few cases where criminal co@@ des are viol@@ ated by citizens without them know@@ ing that they are doing so , and even thinking that it is something positive to do .
so what do you intend to do to show , through general campa@@ ig@@ ns or whatever , that this is a very important matter and that the future of the au@@ dio@@ vis@@ ual industry in Europe is at sta@@ ke ?
. the Commission will continue monitoring what is going on in individual Member States .
various Member States such as the United Kingdom , France and Germany have already put in place large @-@ scale education and awareness programmes .
the Commission does not have more resources than Member States .
it is a matter primarily for Member States to ensure that the point you have val@@ id@@ ly raised is more wid@@ ely known , along with the problems that ar@@ ise from un@@ lic@@ ens@@ ed and illegal c@@ op@@ ying .
I am informed that the b@@ lack market value of illegal C@@ D@@ s and D@@ V@@ D@@ s is three times that of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , and the prof@@ it mar@@ g@@ ins are eight @-@ f@@ old .
therefore it is a much more pro@@ fi@@ table activity , with lower risks of being cau@@ ght and lower penal@@ ties .
it is thus in the interests of the Member States to ensure that awareness measures are in place in an effort to stop this activity .
. first of all I would like to say that the question of the se@@ at of the European Parliament is covered by Protocol No 8 on the establishment of the se@@ ats of the institutions , specific organisations and services of the European Commun@@ ities such as Europol , and is anne@@ xed to the Treaty of Amster@@ dam .
the question of the loc@@ ation of the institutions has had a very high priority and concerns a high level of decision @-@ making , relating not only to the loc@@ ation of our institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg , but also to Luxemb@@ our@@ g .
this concerns a very high @-@ level political decision .
for the Commission the total cost of mis@@ sions of officials to Strasbourg amoun@@ ted to EUR 1.@@ 7 million in 2003 .
this includes all the costs of mis@@ sions , including those of Commission officials and members of Commissioners &apos; offic@@ es .
so this is not a large amount of money .
a sli@@ ghtly higher amount is fo@@ rec@@ ast for the future .
you asked about all the costs for the Union .
we do not have a very precise over@@ view of all costs , but we know that for the European Parliament the costs are much higher .
according to the March 2004 report by Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten , ME@@ P , the total cost of having part @-@ s@@ es@@ sions in both Brussels and Strasbourg amounts to about EUR 200 million ann@@ u@@ ally .
Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten fav@@ ou@@ red Brussels as the single se@@ at of Parliament and he was supported by Parliament &apos;s Committee on Bud@@ getary Con@@ tro@@ l .
the Commission is not in a position to jud@@ ge the functioning of the European Parliament .
Madam President , Commissioner , I appreciate the difficulties with the figures because there are so many of us who have to be mo@@ ved between these two se@@ ats .
it is not only a cost in terms of money but also a cost to the environment , which I think is inc@@ redi@@ bly important .
I find it extremely difficult to defend these jour@@ ne@@ ys to people in Europe and Sweden when they ask questions about this issue .
we are concerned here with a lot of money , which we could spen@@ d on many other important issues within the EU .
I think this issue is important , and we should raise it as often as possible until we are able to have a single se@@ at for our work , h@@ ope@@ fully in Brussels .
. that is your opinion .
as I said , the loc@@ ation of the European institutions was decided in 19@@ 5@@ 7 and it has continued to be a very high level of political decision @-@ making .
the Commission is ready to discuss all these issues .
it is very difficult to estima@@ te the costs to the environment , but the amount of money in our budget for 2003 was EUR 1.@@ 7 million .
Madam President , Commissioner , do you agree with me that Strasbourg is the se@@ at of Parliament , that it is only by way of a conc@@ ession in order to reduce bureauc@@ racy in its cooperation with the other European institutions that it mi@@ gra@@ tes to Brussels , and that its princi@@ p@@ al se@@ at is here in Strasbourg ?
do you also agree with me that the fig@@ ure of EUR 200 million that you have given for annual expenditure ref@@ ers not to the ex@@ tra costs , but to the total costs of running this House ?
. the loc@@ ation of European institutions cannot be considered only from the vie@@ w@@ point of the costs involved .
this is a very important political matter .
in his report , Mr van H@@ ul@@ ten put these costs at about EUR 200 million , most of which were inc@@ ur@@ red as a result of travel between Brussels and Strasbourg and vice ver@@ sa .
I do not have more precise figures , but the overall costs of Parliament , as can been seen in the budget , are higher .
yes , Madam President , Commissioner , this question has obviously come up repe@@ a@@ tedly since we have been in this ma@@ g@@ nific@@ ent Chamber , and I believe we would all like to have a single place of work , that is true .
we all want to cut costs , we all want to cut waste , we all want to cut pollution , but I think the question today is the loc@@ ation of the se@@ at of the European Parliament .
today it is in Strasbourg , and I think France and the citizens of Strasbourg are happy to welcome it and are doing all they can to make us feel at home .
for my part , I would like to know whether a study has been carried out to find out whether there really is a difference , because any jour@@ ne@@ y to Brussels or Strasbourg represents a cost , which is the same for everyone .
whether Members travel to Strasbourg or to Brussels , I do not therefore believe it is really worth making a f@@ us@@ s about this se@@ at every time .
it is really a political question for our political authorities .
. this is a political question and I have no comments on it .
this was decided in 19@@ 5@@ 7 .
I can assure you that the Commission has no intention of proposing any changes on this compl@@ icated matter .
. I am very happy to reply to this question , because immediately after I was desig@@ na@@ ted as the Commissioner responsible for several areas , including OLAF , I was appro@@ ac@@ hed and asked how to go ahead with various projects and proposals on the future of OLAF , including possible management decisions .
several different options were proposed . one was to f@@ ill this post through an open competition .
I promis@@ ed that I would express my opinion after the form@@ alities were over .
the form@@ alities were comple@@ ted on 22 November and immediately after the new Commission started we made the decision to adver@@ t@@ ise this post and f@@ ill it through an open competition .
today we received the final opinion of the legal services about some nu@@ an@@ ces concerning the announ@@ cement .
a few days ago I received the first ver@@ sion of the job descri@@ p@@ tion , so the post will be adver@@ tis@@ ed very soon .
there will then be an open competition .
I would like to know how the new time sch@@ edu@@ le loo@@ ks now , and what time has been allocated to Parliament to hear the candid@@ ates .
. the Commission realis@@ es clearly that this is a specific post and that Parliament and Council must be consul@@ ted on the ap@@ poin@@ tment of the Direc@@ tor .
the dead@@ line is 1 March , which is when the term ex@@ pi@@ res .
if we publis@@ h it now , the competition procedure will be quite short .
I hope that at the beginning of next year we will have enough time to consul@@ t with the relevant parliamentary committee and the Council about proposed candid@@ ates .
we will try to sel@@ ec@@ t candid@@ ates as soon as possible and then start the consultation with Parliament .
the Commission has no intention of reducing Parliament &apos;s role in this very sensitive matter .
in the abs@@ ence of the Member who put it , Ques@@ tion 37 lap@@ ses .
. the honourable Member &apos;s question covered two areas : firstly cultural diversity , pl@@ ur@@ alism and independence and secondly achieving a knowledge @-@ based economy .
cultural diversity is en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in Community law , mainly in the Amster@@ dam Protocol .
the second aspect is an innovation @-@ encouraging and technology @-@ wel@@ coming strategy .
both these objectives have a vital role to play in the future EU .
Community law does not exclu@@ de the possibility of defin@@ ing new media services as a public service .
however , new technologies must be emb@@ rac@@ ed by all ac@@ tors - both public and private - for a successful information society for all .
this means that appropriate public service obligations may be needed and imposed in the environment of these new technologies .
the Commission communication of 2001 on the application of state aid rules to public service broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting confir@@ ms that the Member States are responsible for the financing and definition of public service broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting .
in that communication the Commission does not exclu@@ de the possibility that certain on @-@ line activities could be per@@ formed as a public service .
thus Member States may take appropriate actions to achieve the objectives mentioned .
however , I should like to remind you that other media pla@@ yers - both existing operators and new entr@@ ants - have a role to play in contribu@@ ting to pl@@ ur@@ alism , cultural diversity , innovation , competitiveness and consumer choice .
Madam President , thank you very much for your answer .
my question is based on the fact that there are many who would limit the opportunities for public service to operate .
lim@@ iting public service by bann@@ ing the use of certain technology is just one way of doing this .
there are also those who see the new T@@ V directive , as well as the proposed services directive , as a way of lim@@ iting public service .
how is the Commission to ensure that these directives in particular do not enc@@ ro@@ ach upon the right of the Member States themselves to define what public service is and what conditions shall apply to the public service companies ?
. Madam President , there is a hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y of directives , and the directive concerned with television is the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision without F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive .
the Treaty is also important , and the Amster@@ dam Protocol is very clear on the matter .
that is why , in order to emphasise legal certainty , the Commission published its communication on state aid to public television in 2001 , and why it expres@@ s@@ ly included the option for Member States of affor@@ ding the Internet , among other things , the same treatment as public television , provided the Internet is part of the public sector and subject to the same obligations .
. Madam President , I must also say in this connection that the Commission is the guar@@ di@@ an of the Treaties , and that it has always done what is necessary to ensure compliance with the competition rules , in particular the provisions concerning State aid in the field of broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting .
still on this question , I would like to add that the 2001 communication on State aid to public service broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting clari@@ f@@ ies the way in which the relevant rules must be applied .
it expla@@ ins clearly , should there still be any need to do so , that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defin@@ ing its re@@ mit , and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broad@@ c@@ ast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the re@@ mit should be .
the Commission loo@@ ks only at whether the definition of the re@@ mit and the financing cor@@ respond to the reality on the ground .
the important thing in the e@@ yes of the Commission is therefore that the re@@ mit be defined as clearly and precisely as possible , and that if a public service goes beyond its public re@@ mit it should keep separate accounts for commercial activities such as the s@@ ale of adver@@ tis@@ ing space , for example .
thank you for your reply , Mrs R@@ eding .
thank you for clari@@ fying so precisely what we already know to be laid down in Community legislation .
the purpose of my question , Commissioner , was to try to go a little further .
in all the countries of the European Union , we often note that , in accordance with that interpre@@ tation of our rules , which you have clari@@ fied so well , there is often - shall we say - per@@ ver@@ se behaviour that trans@@ g@@ res@@ ses free competition .
do you believe that we could seek to produce a new for@@ mu@@ lation , a new text , which is able to bring together the public service criteria in a cle@@ ar@@ er manner ?
. the honourable Member is well aware that the Commission cannot go beyond the existing texts .
however , as talks are currently being held with the industry about a possible revision of the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision without F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive , this is the time to put another definition on the table , if need be .
I am therefore waiting to see what the public and private sectors have to say on the matter .
I would also like to say to the honourable Member that if the private sector fil@@ es a compla@@ int for un@@ fair competition , the Commission takes up that compla@@ int , examin@@ es whether the public sector is right or wrong and grants or re@@ jects the requests made .
one might mention a number of interesting author@@ is@@ ations which are cases in point ; for example , State aid to and to was allowed , as was aid to and other programmes of the same kind , because they were compatible with the rules .
others were amended or rejected .
we still have cases that are being examin@@ ed , and you can be sure , Mr Her@@ r@@ ero @-@ T@@ e@@ j@@ ed@@ or , that the Commission tries to apply the rules every time , and to ensure that there can be free competition between a public sector and a private sector which must not be sti@@ f@@ led .
. the honourable Member raised the issue of the provision of sub@@ t@@ it@@ ling and au@@ di@@ o descri@@ p@@ tion last year in Parliament &apos;s resolution on television without fron@@ ti@@ ers .
it is certain that dig@@ ital broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting off@@ ers improved sub@@ t@@ it@@ ling and au@@ di@@ o descri@@ p@@ tion when compared with the an@@ alogue system .
there are already standards for these services .
I see the s@@ wit@@ cho@@ ver to dig@@ ital television as an opportunity for enhan@@ ced services of this type .
it is not a threat .
as I told Parliament at my hear@@ ing in September , I believe that the development of new technologies must be to the benefit of citizens and of their welfare .
that is why my services will shor@@ tly publis@@ h a call for ten@@ ders , laun@@ ching a study on acc@@ es@@ sibility to dig@@ ital television .
this study will focus on developing policy mo@@ del@@ s in order to help Member States implement assis@@ tive services .
I would also like to say that there is no requirement in European law for broad@@ c@@ as@@ ters in Member States to provide sub@@ t@@ it@@ ling and au@@ di@@ o descri@@ p@@ tions .
provision of assis@@ tive service is hand@@ led under the subsidiarity principle , but there are of course some areas coordin@@ ated at Community level by the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision W@@ i@@ th@@ out F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive .
within the framework of this directive , I have called on the contact committee to provide information on the measures taken by the Member States in order to enhan@@ ce the opportunities for access of vis@@ u@@ all@@ y@@ - and hear@@ ing @-@ im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people to television programmes .
we are now in the process of collec@@ ting and analys@@ ing the Member States &apos; re@@ p@@ lies .
our aim is to promote best practice among regula@@ tors and industry groups and we will work with Member States to promote availa@@ bility of assis@@ tive services and to fos@@ ter an econom@@ ically vi@@ able market for equipment that addres@@ ses acc@@ es@@ sibility needs .
the Commissioner will not be surpris@@ ed that with a new Commission we raise these issues once again .
in fact , she would probably be surpris@@ ed if we did not .
I accept what she says in relation to the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision without F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive , but I would ask her to keep a very close e@@ ye on this issue .
subsidiarity is a fine thing , but she will know that the European Union has been funding con@@ fer@@ ences on sub@@ t@@ it@@ ling for some 20 years and more , and that the actual increase in its inc@@ idence among broad@@ c@@ as@@ ters is very limited indeed .
will she , for example , ensure that a ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king process takes place so that we see a gradu@@ al increase year by year ?
can she today comment on when she will bring forward the results of the analysis that she has undertaken in relation to the contact group and in what form she will do so ; and can she give hope to b@@ lin@@ d and de@@ a@@ f people throughout Europe that better television services will pre@@ va@@ il ?
. I would like to assure the honourable Member that I remember his letter of 25 November 2003 on the subject very well .
now that I am responsible not only for the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision without F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive but also for the new media in general , I will certainly put even more w@@ eight on this question than I did before .
the answer to the honourable Member &apos;s question is that the study on the policy mo@@ del@@ s will start at the beginning of 2005 and will fin@@ ish rou@@ gh@@ ly one year later , between the beginning and m@@ iddle of 2006 .
as for the Con@@ tac@@ t Committee , its work is continuing and the results will be published on the we@@ b in early 2005 .
the Commissioner will be aware that I have been ra@@ ising with her the question of the broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting of the Eng@@ lis@@ h P@@ re@@ mi@@ ership on television .
the Commissioner has re@@ pli@@ ed that broad@@ b@@ and Internet may be a possibility for broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting this without restric@@ tion .
if broad@@ b@@ and Internet is to be used as a new way of providing more wid@@ es@@ pread communication , could I ask the Commissioner if she would also consider introducing provisions in the new proposals she is putting forward to ensure that broad@@ b@@ and Internet broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting arrangements also include some su@@ itable sub@@ t@@ it@@ ling for the kind of people mentioned in the question ?
. Madam President , the Commission is obviously required to be neu@@ tra@@ l in matters of technology .
what is true for one technology must be true for another , and we must show persons who have difficulties in particip@@ ating fully in the information society the same respect regar@@ d@@ less of the technology .
in substance , therefore , it does not change anything , but in form , of course , it does , and where we are encouraging broad@@ b@@ and technology , persons with si@@ ght or hear@@ ing problems must obviously be assis@@ ted .
inc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly , we are seeing , for example , that third @-@ generation tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ es really do allow us to meet these persons &quot; needs ; they enable the hard of hear@@ ing to use the tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one by trans@@ mit@@ ting an im@@ age of the li@@ ps .
. Madam President , I would like to say to Mr E@@ b@@ ner that the T@@ el@@ ev@@ ision without F@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers Directive la@@ ys down the principle that television adver@@ tis@@ ing and tel@@ es@@ hop@@ p@@ ing must be kept separate from other parts of the programme by op@@ tical and ac@@ ous@@ tic means .
the Directive also states that sur@@ re@@ p@@ t@@ itious adver@@ tis@@ ing and tel@@ es@@ hop@@ p@@ ing are prohi@@ bi@@ ted .
as I have already said in answer to previous questions , the Directive is being re@@ vie@@ wed , and the public consultation held in 2003 allowed the various parties concerned to express their views .
some operators are in fact in favour of making the rule on adver@@ tis@@ ing more flexible to take account of changing technology by allowing sp@@ li@@ t s@@ cre@@ ens , for example , or the market@@ ing of equipment that would enable vie@@ w@@ ers to avoid adver@@ tis@@ ing messa@@ ges .
however , in 2003 there was a consensus that adver@@ tis@@ ing should be clearly identi@@ fied so as to avoid mis@@ leading the public .
that consultation did not identi@@ fy any development in Europe of product pla@@ cement adver@@ tis@@ ing practices that would viol@@ ate the terms of the Directive .
that is why this point was clari@@ fied in the Commission &apos;s 2003 interpre@@ ta@@ tive communication on certain aspects of the provisions on tel@@ ev@@ ised adver@@ tis@@ ing .
I am of course prepared to go over all these matters again in connection with a possible revision of the Directive , which I intend to present in 2005 .
thank you , Madam President .
I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that she will give priority to consumer protection in this case if there is to be a change of opinion in 2005 .
the fact is that existing practice has not been particularly satisfactory , with appro@@ ac@@ hes having been taken that do not protect the consumer , and something must be done about that .
. Madam President , I shall , then , try to set an equally good example and to keep it brief .
consumer protection is of course high up on the agenda and we will take due account of it ; the Commission is prepared , in revis@@ ing this Directive , to cooperate closely not only with the MEPs who concern themselves with consumer protection , but also with consumer protection organisations .
. the honourable Member asked if the Commissioner agre@@ es with the adjus@@ ted interpre@@ tation of paragraph 14 of the United Kingdom P@@ ri@@ va@@ cy and E@@ lec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic Commun@@ ications ( EC Directive ) Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , 2003 , which de@@ als with the use of loc@@ ation data .
since this question is related to an interpre@@ tation of national law , I would refer the honourable Member to Mr R@@ ic@@ hard Th@@ om@@ as , the In@@ for@@ mation Commissioner in the United Kingdom , who is responsible for en@@ for@@ cing these priva@@ cy and electronic communication regulations .
the regulations trans@@ pose the European directive on priva@@ cy and economic communication - the e@@ P@@ ri@@ va@@ cy Directive .
as the member of the Commission responsible for this directive , I am pleased to indic@@ ate the following elements for the benefit of any national interpre@@ tation exercise .
this EU e@@ P@@ ri@@ va@@ cy Directive provides that loc@@ ation data may be used , but only with the con@@ sent of the sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ er or us@@ er .
pri@@ or to that con@@ sent , the us@@ er or sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ er has to be informed of the types of data proc@@ ess@@ ed , the purpose and du@@ ration of the proc@@ essing , and whether the data will be passed on to third parties for the purpose of the service .
however , the Commission is not of the view that the directive requires the us@@ er or sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ er to be informed of or con@@ sent to the loc@@ ation pri@@ or to every single attempt by the lo@@ ca@@ tor to loc@@ ate him .
nevertheless , the directive requires that sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ers and users , even if they have sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed to a loc@@ ation @-@ based service , be able to tempor@@ arily blo@@ ck the loc@@ ating fac@@ ility .
thank you , Commissioner .
I will take on board your comments about referring this back to the UK .
however , I want to follow this up .
under the current provisions , although per@@ mission should be s@@ ought , there are no guarantees that it will be .
if some@@ body can be trac@@ ked without their know@@ ing it , that has very serious implications .
for the person being trac@@ ked , their personal security is viol@@ ated ; they may be , for instance , under the threat of violence .
there is a whole range of very serious civil liber@@ ties issues here .
I urge you to take this very seriously .
I will take it up in the UK and hope that you will pursue it here .
. I would say to the honourable Member that if there were a problem of that sort , or if information were not made available to the consumers , then making a compla@@ int to the national responsible body would be the right thing to do .
. Madam President , the European Commission is of course extremely concerned at the many human rights viol@@ ations , including mass rap@@ es , taking place in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o in consequ@@ ence of a long period of conflict .
the Commission has in fact made support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic trans@@ ition part of its 2003 @-@ 2007 strategy for cooperation with the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o .
this support is a differ@@ enti@@ ated and compl@@ ementary response to the problem of mass rap@@ es in that country .
Community cooperation experience in the health sector goes back a long way , with EUR 70 million having been spent on support programmes since 199@@ 2 .
these programmes encourage access to basic health care and the supply of medicines at prices appropriate to the situation on the ground .
a new health support programme amoun@@ ting to around EUR 70 million will be put in place to consolid@@ ate what has been achieved by the earlier programmes , and to extend their activities to other areas relating to health .
in its global plan for 2005 , EC@@ H@@ O confir@@ ms its support for areas with a high inc@@ idence of sexual violence , in particular in the K@@ iv@@ us and Man@@ i@@ em@@ a .
projects designed to restor@@ e the rule of law and promote women &apos;s rights are also being fun@@ ded by the European initiative for democracy and human rights .
the Commission is also very active in the field of institutional support .
since the beginning of this year it has in fact been assis@@ ting the B@@ uni@@ a court of first instance in I@@ tur@@ i , which de@@ als with cases of ra@@ pe .
the purpose of this support is to combat im@@ pun@@ ity and to pac@@ i@@ fy the region .
on a more structural level , the Commission is putting in place a mechanism for partnership and support for the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese Government with a view to re@@ form@@ ing the justice system .
this will ultimately enable the national cour@@ ts to deal effectively with cases involving actions for ra@@ pe .
finally , en@@ vel@@ ope B , to which the honourable Member ref@@ ers in his question , is providing around EUR 27 million for urgent re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation work in C@@ ong@@ o &apos;s eas@@ tern prov@@ inc@@ es , which are the most seriously affected by the conflict and hence by human rights viol@@ ations .
Madam President , grateful though I am to the Commissioner for his detailed reply , I still have the feel@@ ing that we are fighting a running b@@ attle in some ways .
only a few weeks ago , the Presidents of R@@ wan@@ da and of the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o concluded a new peace agreement , only to be at each other &apos;s th@@ ro@@ ats again a few days later .
my own sources in that country - a number of Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic pri@@ es@@ ts - have re@@ ported to me that there have been many gan@@ g rap@@ es .
once again , thousands to ten@@ s of thousands of women have been rap@@ ed .
the Commission is indeed funding a programme in the region , but should we not look into the real ro@@ ots of the conflict ?
we all know that there are mas@@ sive ga@@ ins to be made from the min@@ er@@ al resources - di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , c@@ ol@@ tan and g@@ old .
together with the Council and its presidency , should the Commission not be taking action about this ?
this has been going on for years .
I do indeed believe , Commissioner , that everyone ex@@ pects you , with your personal de@@ d@@ ication and your personal knowledge of the region , together with your colleague , Mrs F@@ er@@ r@@ ero @-@ W@@ al@@ d@@ ner , to have a str@@ onger and more effective presence in that region , and I should like to hear your view on this .
. Madam President , I very much agree with the honourable Member .
as you well know , I am very sensitive to and very concerned at the situation in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es countries and , more especially , by what is happening in eas@@ tern C@@ ong@@ o .
that is why , when I leave you tomorrow morning , I shall be f@@ lying out there to make a repeat visit to all those countries and to review the situation with their leaders .
I am also aware of the renew@@ ed ab@@ uses and renew@@ ed and extremely serious acts of violence that the region is again wit@@ n@@ essing .
the problem is not only the e@@ x @-@ F@@ A@@ R / I@@ nte@@ ra@@ ha@@ m@@ we , there are also groups of what are really organised crimin@@ als and others who are really living off the bac@@ ks of the population and are behind what can only be described as at@@ ro@@ c@@ ities .
I shall therefore be t@@ our@@ ing the cap@@ i@@ tal@@ s between 15 and 20 December .
I shall be meeting with those countries &quot; presid@@ ents and various people in positions of responsibility , including United Nations officials , to see what the international community can really do and , in particular , what the international community is in the end prepared to do .
we are well aware that the problem will not be sol@@ ved by the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese ar@@ my and police .
they are not , at this present time , in a position to do so and it would be better to give the United Nations M@@ is@@ sion in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o ( MO@@ N@@ U@@ C ) another mandate : it needs more resources in terms of ability to act on the ground .
as you are also aware , its present mandate does not allow it to dis@@ arm people by force , for example , but only to collec@@ t weapons from those who are willing to hand them over .
there is therefore a principle of volun@@ tar@@ ism involved and I shall be trying to conv@@ in@@ ce the people with whom I have talks .
first of all , I am going to try and per@@ su@@ ade the R@@ wan@@ d@@ ans and the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese to keep cal@@ m and not to act in has@@ te and risk re@@ opening a conflict when the trans@@ ition process is in full s@@ wing .
I am therefore first going to try to conv@@ in@@ ce them of the necess@@ ity of preser@@ ving the trans@@ ition process .
then I shall be doing my ut@@ most to per@@ su@@ ade the international community , which is represented in the country by bodies like the United Nations , of the need to take the necessary decisions to sett@@ le this matter once and for all , because , as you so rightly said , the rule of law is no longer truly a reality in that part of the world .
having said that , the pro@@ of that I am in total agreement with you is that I am lea@@ ving to t@@ our the area again tomorrow , and to take sto@@ ck of the situation on the ground .
there is the question of elections in C@@ ong@@ o , of the timetable for those elections , and the legislation that still has to be passed by the parliament for those elections to be held .
you are aware , since I have already said so pub@@ lic@@ ly , that I believe the election timetable should be left un@@ changed so as to keep up the pressure on the authorities .
I am also going to ar@@ gue in K@@ ig@@ al@@ i that there should be no inc@@ ur@@ sions of K@@ ig@@ al@@ i tro@@ op@@ s into foreign territory .
as you see , I am therefore planning to make another complete review of the situation .
unfortunately , Mr Sta@@ es , it is beyond my power to resolve the problem myself , and I can only hope that my powers of per@@ su@@ a@@ sion will have an effect this time .
at any rate , believe me , I shall be vo@@ ic@@ ing your concerns because they are my own .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , over the last few dec@@ ad@@ es , humanitarian aid workers have oper@@ ated in ins@@ ec@@ ure and un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table conditions .
I am sure we are all aware that the risks they run in order to provide aid in un@@ stable situations have increased consider@@ ably .
take the examples of Iraq , C@@ ô@@ te d &apos;@@ I@@ vo@@ ire and D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r in particular .
reli@@ ef workers have very often , too often in fact , come under attack from the armed forces and mil@@ iti@@ as .
given the difficult conditions in which the Commission , through EC@@ H@@ O , the Hu@@ man@@ ita@@ rian A@@ id Office , and its partners , is working , it is becoming increasingly difficult to get material aid and assistance to those who are suffering .
it also has to be said that the growing involvement in humanitarian activities of pla@@ yers who are not stric@@ tly humanitarian , such as the military , has sometimes resul@@ ted in ro@@ les becoming conf@@ used , with the consequ@@ ent risks for the safety of reli@@ ef workers .
in order to preser@@ ve the existence of a humanitarian space and , consequently , to ensure that aid and equipment reac@@ hes the victims , the Commission &apos;s decisions are based on humanitarian values and principles and on a desire to provide quality assistance through its partnership with humanitarian organisations .
in accordance with the Council &apos;s rules on humanitarian aid , the Commission &apos;s decisions are therefore dicta@@ ted sol@@ ely by basic humanitarian needs and principles , namely neu@@ tr@@ ality , im@@ parti@@ ality and independence .
obser@@ van@@ ce of these principles should help to protect reli@@ ef workers and give them access to victims in cases of conflict .
in order to maintain the distinc@@ tion between the ro@@ les of the military and of reli@@ ef workers , the Commission supports the key role of civil@@ ian organisations when implementing humanitarian measures in situations where military capacity and resources are used .
to do so , it maintain@@ s that such rec@@ our@@ se must comply with the guidelines for the use of ar@@ my and civil defence resources in complex emergency humanitarian aid operations conduc@@ ted by the United Nations .
EC@@ H@@ O is not an operational organisation .
its task is to finance the coordin@@ ated provision of humanitarian aid through part@@ ner organisations , for example international NGOs , other international organisations or the United Nations .
the quality and effectiveness of EC@@ H@@ O &apos;s aid depen@@ d very much on its partners &quot; professional ab@@ il@@ ities .
all organisations sig@@ ning the partnership agreement by vir@@ tu@@ e of which they work with EC@@ H@@ O therefore com@@ mit themselves to up@@ holding the fundamental humanitarian values and principles I have just mentioned .
the basic objective of humanitarian aid is neither to prevent nor to resolve conflicts , but to alle@@ vi@@ ate the human suffering they cause .
in consultation with other s@@ pon@@ sor@@ s and partners , EC@@ H@@ O is actively looking for ways of tac@@ kl@@ ing the growing problems of access to victims and the safety of reli@@ ef workers , with the aim of improving the situation in that regard .
governments , armed forces and non @-@ state pla@@ yers need to be made more aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law .
that law states that the parties to a conflict must facilitate the pas@@ sa@@ ge of aid con@@ vo@@ ys and the provision of neu@@ tra@@ l assistance to civil@@ ians affected by a conflict .
to give a real @-@ life example of this principle , when I w@@ ent to S@@ ud@@ an , to D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r to be more precise , I remin@@ ded the government authorities and the re@@ bel@@ s that it was absolutely essential that they allow international humanitarian organisations free access to the victims and the people in need of help .
that is a fundamental principle and , in quo@@ ting that example , I am also stres@@ sing the importance of the political dialogue between the Commission and those countries &quot; authorities .
- Madam President , I should like to thank Commissioner L@@ ou@@ is M@@ ic@@ he@@ l for being so very an@@ al@@ y@@ tical on this entire , highly important issue , especially when , very recently in the I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast , there have also been forces bel@@ ong@@ ing to a country of the European Union .
however , my question is a suppl@@ ementary question : has your Commission thought of cu@@ tting humanitarian aid when it is not clear or certain that it will be used by those in need and there is a possibility of its ending up in the hands of the re@@ bel@@ s ?
I raise this in the light of the civil w@@ ars which go on for years and make it impossible to get this financial and material aid to civil@@ ians , especially me@@ dical and p@@ har@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical aid for young children and the el@@ der@@ ly .
. if it is absolutely certain that the aid will not get through , it goes without saying that we ask for it to be cut off .
having said that , I ad@@ mit that it is extremely difficult because we need real @-@ time information .
we generally get that information from the operators on the ground , either NGOs or international organisations , et@@ c .
that all happens in extremely tric@@ ky and extremely sensitive circumstances .
we therefore have to carry out a proper analysis before cu@@ tting off humanitarian aid or sto@@ pp@@ ing sen@@ ding or trying to send it .
you mention C@@ ô@@ te d &apos;@@ I@@ vo@@ ire .
we also have to avoid th@@ ro@@ wing the population into dis@@ ar@@ ra@@ y and total des@@ t@@ itu@@ tion if humanitarian aid is cut off .
obviously , each case is assess@@ ed individu@@ ally on the basis of information from our own dele@@ gations .
I have to say that the high level of dec@@ entr@@ alisation we have today help@@ s a lot .
information reac@@ hes us more reli@@ ably and more quickly , and on the basis of that information we can either continue our work , negoti@@ ate to try and get the aid where it is needed , or quite simply break it off .
but I could not give my bac@@ king to any action that did not take all these things into account .
I nevertheless repeat that all this is extremely difficult , extremely del@@ icate and extremely fra@@ g@@ ile and , we therefore have to look at each case individu@@ ally every time .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in all fields of activity the Commission is constantly ste@@ pp@@ ing up protection for the European Union &apos;s financial interests , especially the prevention of fraud .
development aid is no excep@@ tion , and it should be noted that the Court of Auditors has given a positive statement of as@@ surance concerning the management of the European Development Fund for 2003 .
as the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed , the risks rela@@ te not to the reg@@ ul@@ arity of the transa@@ ctions managed by the delegation &apos;s services but very often to the transa@@ ctions managed by the implementing agencies , be they local associ@@ ations in the developing countries , non @-@ governmental organisations or project management structures .
that is why , in 2003 , the Commission adopted a much more ri@@ goro@@ us approach involving proc@@ ed@@ ural simp@@ li@@ fication and external a@@ ud@@ it , so that such transa@@ ctions can be mon@@ ito@@ red better .
so far as the part played by national interests in development aid is concerned , ten@@ der@@ ing procedures are the best guarantee of transparency and competition , and therefore also of reasonable prices .
moreover , the European Union &apos;s development policy is defined by the Council and Commission joint declaration of November 2000 and by partnership agreements with different regions and countries , such as the Coton@@ ou Agreement , and , finally , by international commitments like the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um Dec@@ lar@@ ation or the Mon@@ ter@@ re@@ y Con@@ sen@@ su@@ s , for example .
that is the framework for the European Union &apos;s development policy , and there is no question of any Member State &apos;s specific national interests .
on the contrary , that is the compar@@ ative advantage of a development policy conduc@@ ted by the Community : it represents European values , principles and objectives , it is perc@@ eiv@@ ed by our partners to be neu@@ tra@@ l with respect to national policies and it is based on a genuine concept of partnership with those countries which is genuinely implemented .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to have practical proposals for measures .
recently , OLAF re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed that economic aid for L@@ es@@ oth@@ o did not get through and that the resources were thus not used for the purpose intended .
I want to hear more practical proposals from the Commissioner .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , for@@ give me , but it seems to me that the mechanisms being used at the moment are sufficient .
the pro@@ of is that you refer to a case that was in fact brought to our no@@ tice by our delegation .
I think , therefore , that all the necessary procedures were set in motion immediately ; compla@@ ints were lo@@ d@@ ged , et@@ c .
the whole mechanism respon@@ ded as it should .
of course , everything possible should be done to prevent fraud .
but everything must also be done to prevent our entire system g@@ rin@@ ding to a hal@@ t in the process .
I think the controls we have today are adequate and the financial rules are suffici@@ ently precise and restric@@ tive .
I do not question them .
obviously we are in favour , I am in favour , of z@@ ero toler@@ ance , but , if you will for@@ give me , there is , on the other hand , no such thing as z@@ ero risk .
neither can we keep on increasing the number of controls , eval@@ uations and a@@ ud@@ its over and over again , only to find in the end that no more projects are being implemented .
both humanitarian and development emer@@ gen@@ cies ar@@ ise .
you ask me for concrete measures , but you know what measures are de@@ plo@@ yed and , on the basis of the information I have , I am not in favour of creating additional measures .
the OLAF mechanism is completely independent and works well .
our dele@@ gations on the ground send back extremely important information , and even if we only have m@@ ere ru@@ m@@ ours , a rapid al@@ er@@ t mechanism is put in place immediately .
I think it would be difficult to do more .
what we could still do , if you want a concrete measure , would be to keep our dele@@ gations well informed and to tra@@ in them well , so that they are able to respond very quickly , be on constan@@ t al@@ er@@ t and make the most of any information they may receive .
there you are ; I am of course willing to discuss the matter and to revis@@ e my opinion , but I think there are already enough controls , especially so far as my por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o is concerned .
all these controls , eval@@ uations , a@@ ud@@ its and obsta@@ cle cour@@ ses seem to me to be am@@ ply sufficient and I am therefore rather re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to inv@@ ent anything else .
.
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in political terms the year 2003 in M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia was mar@@ ked by two major events .
the first was an attemp@@ ted on 8 and 9 June , and the second was the presid@@ ential election of 7 November , which saw the re @-@ election of the inc@@ u@@ mb@@ ent President Maa@@ ou@@ y@@ a O@@ u@@ ld S@@ id &apos;@@ A@@ h@@ med T@@ a@@ y@@ a , who has been in power since 198@@ 4 .
this latest presid@@ ential election was preced@@ ed and followed by ar@@ res@@ ts , most probably somewhat ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary , of leading political figures .
given the restrictions on the exercise of civil liber@@ ties in the context of the war on terrorism , and the measures taken in the after@@ ma@@ th of the attemp@@ ted , 2003 may be regar@@ ded as a year of reg@@ res@@ sion on the democracy fron@@ t .
the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation does not seem to have ga@@ ther@@ ed p@@ ace in 2004 .
nevertheless , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia remains a country where dialogue is possible among the various com@@ pon@@ ents of the power structure , even if that dialogue is in@@ vari@@ ably f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght with ten@@ sion .
the Commission is aware of the fra@@ g@@ ility of this situation .
this is why , in the n@@ in@@ th European Development Fund , an amount of EUR ten million , or in other words 10 % of the total appropri@@ ation , was allocated to the tasks of strengthening capac@@ ities and establishing the rule of law .
the Commission considers it essential , of course , to remain vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant .
it seems to me , however , that the s@@ et@@ back in the democ@@ rat@@ isation process does not yet war@@ r@@ ant a vi@@ goro@@ us initiative to secure a negoti@@ ated solution to the M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ ni@@ an crisis .
let me add that the M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ ni@@ an Government was informed that its alloc@@ ation under the n@@ in@@ th E@@ D@@ F was to be reduced by EUR ten million , ch@@ i@@ efly to take account of ina@@ dequate sec@@ tor@@ al per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in those very areas of strengthening capac@@ ities and establishing the rule of law , as identi@@ fied in 2004 &quot; s mid @-@ term review .
although the reduction in funding has more to do with ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion capacity than with the political situation , it should signal to the M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ ni@@ an authorities how im@@ per@@ ative it is to b@@ ol@@ s@@ ter the rule of law .
in any case , the European Union is conduc@@ ting an inten@@ si@@ fied political dialogue with the M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ ni@@ an authorities , and is keeping a very close e@@ ye on developments .
moreover , I shall be making personal contact with the President &apos;s office and with a number of our connec@@ tions in M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia to discuss the situation .
the primary purpose of this dialogue is to promote good political and economic governance .
to this end , it seeks to support the pursu@@ it of the democ@@ rat@@ isation process that beg@@ an with the elections in 2001 by highli@@ ghting the need to respect the rule of law and its instruments .
to su@@ m up my reply to your question , I do not think there are sufficient grounds for embar@@ king in the immediate future on a vi@@ goro@@ us initiative designed to secure a negoti@@ ated solution to the crisis in M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia .
this does not appear to be justified at the present time .
thank you , Commissioner , for your reply , which shows that you recognise how the situation de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated in 2003 and acknowledge that M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia has indeed been in crisis .
it is true that few people know much about M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia .
indeed , it is vir@@ tually a for@@ go@@ t@@ ten country .
we are not too sure whether it will be part of the Coton@@ ou Agre@@ ements with the ACP countries , or whether it will enter into the Euro @-@ Mediterranean framework .
ultimately , now that the European Union is one of M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s main don@@ ors , we should like to know whether the country will depen@@ d on ACP funding or on the new delegation that has been created .
on the same subject , may I ask you to provide for closer monitoring .
in fact , in the light of current events , and if we focus only on what has been allocated to M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia in the fisheries sector , we must conclude that proper monitoring and control are des@@ ira@@ ble and that we ought to be able to ensure that this control is exerc@@ ised .
. I naturally share your concern .
the problem that exis@@ ted in 2003 has certainly not become any more ac@@ u@@ te in 2004 .
I can only promis@@ e to ensure that the political dialogue with the authorities will be quickly rela@@ un@@ ched , and that it will focus on the concerns which you have clearly expressed and which I share .
in the coming weeks , at the beginning of the new year , I shall establish more reg@@ ular contact with the authorities - whom I know well , inc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly .
indeed , in my previous life as a Foreign Minister , I visi@@ ted M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia and was struc@@ k by the fact that , although the majority of its population are Mus@@ lim@@ s , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia is one of the only Mus@@ li@@ m countries that maintain@@ s relations with Israel and therefore tries to be even @-@ han@@ ded .
I ad@@ mi@@ red M@@ au@@ ri@@ ta@@ nia for that , because the ability of a Mus@@ li@@ m country to adopt an even @-@ han@@ ded approach to a conflict such as that in the Middle East seem@@ ed to me to indic@@ ate intellig@@ ence and a desire to avoid ex@@ pos@@ ing the country &apos;s political life to fundamentalis@@ m or exc@@ esses of any kind .
for this reason , I do not think I shall have any difficul@@ ty in rela@@ un@@ ching this political dialogue .
you can certainly coun@@ t on me to rela@@ un@@ ch it at the start of the new year .
thank you , Commissioner .
questions 48 to 8@@ 7 will be answ@@ ered in wr@@ iting .
the debate will now resu@@ me , with a contin@@ uation of the discussion on the prepar@@ ation of the next Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
Mr S@@ il@@ va P@@ en@@ ed@@ a has the floor for two minu@@ tes .
Mr President , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , a se@@ ven @-@ year period is a long time in the world in which we live .
since the last Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives , the EU has undertaken the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est enlargement in its history and has become even more integrated with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and the sig@@ ning of the Constitutional Treaty .
in the last se@@ ven years , the world has become more glob@@ alised and soci@@ eties have become more complex and di@@ versi@@ fied .
att@@ it@@ ud@@ es , custom@@ s , behaviour and even values have changed .
the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives must therefore be adap@@ table to the current political context and to the new re@@ alities of the world in which we live .
with the decision on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives , we have a uni@@ que opportunity to show that we have a more ambitious vision for Europe , a w@@ inning vision , which I think is shared by the Commission .
we must therefore prevent , at all costs , any low@@ ering of the objectives of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives or any simple act of budgetary consolid@@ ation , which some people would appear to want .
in this context , I should like to ask Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė k@@ ind@@ ly to comment on the three essential pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ tes on which , to my mind , the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives ought to be based .
the first of these is credibility .
the political priorities of ste@@ pp@@ ing up the competitiveness of both the economy and European cohesion must go hand in hand .
secondly , there must be a clear break from previous practices , by which I mean we need to set about re@@ form@@ ing the EU &apos;s own resources .
thirdly , imag@@ ina@@ tive solutions must be created , such as ensuring that funds ear@@ mar@@ ked in the EU &apos;s bud@@ gets also act as a too@@ l for mo@@ bil@@ ising other financial sector resources , be they from the public or private sector .
Mr President , the new financial framework will be the first following EU enlargement .
it must be possible for it to be adopted by everyone , both new and old Member States .
this also applies to states that are quite well off .
in nor@@ thern Europe , on@@ er@@ ous special conditions apply that have not dis@@ appe@@ ared .
it cannot be fair to allow perman@@ ently dis@@ advanta@@ ged areas , for example those with c@@ old cl@@ im@@ ates and long dis@@ tan@@ ces , to pay , as it were , for the fact that , statis@@ tically , they appear to be rich .
there is also an expec@@ tation that certain projects not directly linked to the EU budget are to be turned into a reality .
in the Bal@@ tic region , for example , there is univers@@ al support for improving water quality in the Bal@@ tic .
this means , among other things , that it needs to be possible for all waste water , including that from Sa@@ int Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg , to be cle@@ an@@ ed .
the research priorities must support development of whole regions that have li@@ ved apart for histor@@ ical reasons , such as the Bal@@ tic region and Central Europe .
finally , I would state that there are high expectations of greater clar@@ ity in the EU &apos;s foreign policy .
we face challenges in Ukraine , C@@ auc@@ as@@ us , Belarus and perhaps also Russia .
Mr President , I would like to return to this afternoon &apos;s debate .
it is a great p@@ ity that the Council is not present now to lis@@ ten to our debate on the problems we face with the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive , for , speaking as a regional politic@@ ian - and as one who works in this House &apos;s Committee on Regional Development - it is clear to me that we need the security to plan ahead .
that means that we need agreement , and need it very soon , as 2005 is the final dead@@ line if the planning stage is not to prove in@@ sufficient for the local authorities .
what that also means is that the los@@ s is bor@@ ne by the local sta@@ keh@@ ol@@ ders who want to get involved in planning , because the planning rules will be implemented at this level far too late .
I also endorse what the Commissioner said about it making sense , in this first year with ten new Member States , to extend the period to se@@ ven years , in order to have a long planning stage where the Structural Funds are concerned .
that makes sense in practical terms .
I also want to stress that the Structural Funds must not be turned into a pi@@ g@@ gy ban@@ k , for cohesion is at the heart of the European Union .
in the country I know best , this th@@ ro@@ ws up contradic@@ tions when politicians appeal to the m@@ ass@@ es with speec@@ hes about the 1 % issue , only then to go to Brussels and ask for money to sort out the structural problems in their region .
we want a truly European policy , and that is not it !
Mr President , on the future of European Parliament funding and financing , I accept that it is very important that the Commission and the Council of Ministers , and indeed Parliament , try after the first se@@ ven years to think about ra@@ tion@@ alis@@ ing during the five years of Parliament &apos;s term .
we have the advantage of a fi@@ xed term , we ought to use that for future financial perspective perio@@ ds .
I very much agreed this afternoon with Mr van den Ber@@ g when he said that we must do something in the nation @-@ states to ti@@ gh@@ ten up on accoun@@ tability .
that lead@@ s me on to our ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y in the British Con@@ serva@@ tive group , which is that we should try to do what we can in Europe and do it effectively and effici@@ ently .
if that means doing less , then let us do it better .
too often we try to increase the powers in Europe and increase our cover@@ age of all sor@@ ts of ite@@ ms .
that does not just cost money , it lead@@ s to further d@@ ilu@@ tion of concentra@@ tion , of accoun@@ tability , and that is extremely important .
the other point I wish to raise is about own resources .
we need to consider the method of own resources .
we have a perfectly acceptable method that works quite well and we should not make fundamental changes to it .
I would not ever like to see the im@@ position of a European Union tax , which has been thought about for the period from 20@@ 13 on@@ wards .
that would be a re@@ tro@@ gra@@ de step .
we need to have a Council of Ministers that is all @-@ power@@ ful in my bo@@ o@@ k , even speaking as an ME@@ P .
basi@@ cally it pa@@ ys the bill@@ s , and that is fine by me , provided we can control what we are doing and provide proper accoun@@ tability in future .
Mr President , this question of the European Union &apos;s financial framework is crucial .
it is crucial because the European Union must rise to form@@ id@@ able challenges : bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion , achieving the aim of cohesion , the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of our policy of solidarity , without for@@ getting the less fav@@ ou@@ red regions of the old Union of 15 , meeting commitments under the common agricultural policy and Na@@ tur@@ a 2000 and , above all , achieving the Lisbon objectives in the re@@ al@@ ms of competitiveness , research , employment , training , environmental policy and public health while giving due consideration to the ag@@ eing of our population .
this last point has not been addressed this afternoon , even though an ag@@ eing population clearly has economic and social implications for our future .
faced by these challenges and by the explo@@ sive growth in C@@ hin@@ ese competition , how does the Commission intend to position itself ?
at a time when the Commission and the Council are preparing to open the ga@@ tes of Europe once again , can we continue to operate with a budget that has not developed since the 199@@ 0@@ s , even though the European Union has subsequ@@ ently taken on many new Member States and been accor@@ ded wid@@ er powers under a series of new tre@@ aties ?
Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , we are not reas@@ su@@ red .
questions need to be asked about the Commission &apos;s desire to make tan@@ gible proposals .
arm y@@ our@@ self with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one @-@ per @-@ cen@@ ters , to bring home to them , as Mr Barroso said , that more Europe cannot be achieved without more money .
even allowing for the agreement on the CAP , we already know that it will be impossible to fund the Union &apos;s regional policy between now and 20@@ 13 if we ad@@ here to the one @-@ per @-@ cent c@@ eil@@ ing .
Europe is on the move ; it has been enlarged , it is ambitious , but are you sure , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , that you have the means to fulfil its amb@@ ition ?
what we are asking you to do is tell us what resources are needed to finance our objectives .
and you know that they will have to be increased .
be prepared , Commissioner , to defend the key positions vi@@ goro@@ us@@ ly .
you must be aware that this would be a bad time to disap@@ point not only Parliament , but all the people of Europe too .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start what I have to say by ple@@ ading for greater seri@@ ous@@ ness and a more objective approach .
in our debate this morning on the 2005 Budget , a very large number of speakers appe@@ al@@ ed to the Council to take the Budget more seriously .
if , though , we aim to achieve an agreement with the Council at a time when we are already talking in terms of a motion on Budget short@@ fall , then the figures we have agreed are not credi@@ ble , and many already sus@@ pect that we may well not be able to manage on them .
reading the media over the past few days on the subject of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive , I begin to fear the same thing .
I also fear a similar lack of seri@@ ous@@ ness when it comes to the debate on Turkey and other current issues , and I ask you , Commissioner , not to be a spec@@ ta@@ tor , but to be more politically pr@@ o @-@ active .
the Budget and the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive are work programmes in the form of figures , and today we have started to discuss the policy programme for the next five years .
what we demand is greater competitiveness ; Lisbon and Barcelona are the top priorities and must be implemented just as much as an enhan@@ ced role in the world for young people , the fight against terrorism , enlargement through the addition of C@@ roati@@ a , Bulgar@@ ia and Romania , a new neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy and improved information and commun@@ ications policies .
what I would like you to tell us is whether all the things we have been deb@@ ating today with regard to additional responsibilities and measures are actually contained in the old Commission &apos;s proposal , or whether the new Commission has to put its sta@@ m@@ p upon it and demand political projects ?
up to now , it has only been wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed behind the sc@@ en@@ es that there are constan@@ t discussions about the up@@ per limit .
let us put a stop to playing g@@ am@@ es with nu@@ mb@@ ers and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost , and then we will be able to talk about own resources and the alloc@@ ation of tasks and about who has to do what .
- Mr President , I should like to make three comments on the issue which we are deb@@ ating .
first , I welcome the fact that ne@@ arly all the honourable Members who have spoken considered that the European Union budget should be commen@@ su@@ rate with the amb@@ itions tabled from time to time by both the Commission and Parliament , because it is a fact that policy without money is not possible .
what I find particularly negative is the fact that the siz@@ e of the budget is being discussed and there are ten@@ den@@ cies to make cu@@ t@@ bac@@ ks at a time when , even if the Commission proposal were accepted , this would be the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the European Union &apos;s spending a total of 2@@ .@@ 5 % of all annual public expenditure in Europe , because that is what we are talking about at a time when we have amb@@ itions , as I said , for important and serious things .
secondly , I should like a clari@@ fication on the part of the Commissioner as to what is going to happen in connection with the future of the Structural Funds if no decision is taken by the end of this year , because there is a multi@@ annual aspect to Structural Fund policies , there is the problem of creating what may be a legal la@@ c@@ un@@ a , which will prevent the programmes from starting on 1 January 2007 .
how could this be addressed , Commissioner ?
the third issue on which I wish to comment concerns the cost of enlargement , given that enlargement comes at a price which we have to pay , because it is a major historic choice of the European Union ; on the other hand , however , this price needs to be distribu@@ ted fair@@ ly .
I know that , from a technical point of view , this issue does not come under the issue we are discussing now , but it is tan@@ g@@ ential to the general issue and I should like the Commissioner to tell me if the Commission has at its dispos@@ al studies which show how the cost of enlargement will ultimately be distribu@@ ted .
I refer to the question of own resources , Commissioner , but I think that these issues are directly connec@@ ted .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , work on the new Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive is being undertaken in very difficult circumstances , and has therefore given rise to much contro@@ vers@@ y .
not all the issues under consideration are being discussed .
this may have been the case in the past , but it has come as a surpris@@ e to some of the new entr@@ ants to the Union .
the first point I would like to make is that the proposal to limit the budget to 1 % is not ins@@ pi@@ red by the wish to econom@@ ise , nor does it ste@@ m from a desire to ra@@ tion@@ alise expenditure .
it is the consequ@@ ence of the plan to change the alloc@@ ation of financial resources and the view that the latter can be u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ed more effectively in national policies .
what we are therefore wit@@ n@@ essing is a reduction of the scope of Community policies .
this does not come as a surpris@@ e to advo@@ ca@@ tes of a coordin@@ ating Union , but it is cause for al@@ arm amongst advo@@ ca@@ tes of a strong Union .
restric@@ ting income and expenditure imp@@ acts directly on all countries , because it requires changes to the structure of financing cohesion policy and restric@@ ting its scope .
naturally , the wea@@ kes@@ t countries are the most affected , when they ought to be the main bene@@ fic@@ i@@ aries of this policy .
my second point is that cohesion policy is being re@@ interpre@@ ted before our very e@@ yes .
this policy is becoming increasingly deta@@ ched from its base , namely the principle of shar@@ ing the problems of under @-@ development in the spirit of solidarity , and respon@@ ding join@@ tly also to the pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced ine@@ qu@@ alities which are the ine@@ vi@@ table consequ@@ ence of economic integration .
it is therefore essential to support the efforts made in the Council of the European Union by those governments ra@@ dic@@ ally opposed to amendment of the relevant provisions and dele@@ tion of the principle of supporting the less @-@ developed countries .
an example from the s@@ porting world comes to mind .
ladies and gentlemen , imag@@ ine a situation in which a number of pla@@ yers are rec@@ ru@@ ited to join a fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all te@@ am .
they are eag@@ er to play , prepared to under@@ go a deman@@ ding training period , and full of fighting spirit and the desire to w@@ in .
now imag@@ ine that when they make it on@@ to the fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all pit@@ ch they are informed that the rules have changed and that they will be required to play ru@@ g@@ by instead .
I am sure you will understand that in such a case the pla@@ yers would be un@@ ple@@ as@@ antly surpris@@ ed and taken ab@@ ac@@ k .
it is to be hop@@ ed that the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole will act consisten@@ tly to ensure that the rules remain un@@ changed .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is in my capacity as a representative of the larg@@ est new Member State , Pol@@ and , that I take the floor in today &apos;s Ques@@ tion T@@ ime to the Commission on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
I am emphas@@ ising this as most of the honourable Members who have taken the floor in this debate ha@@ il from the old Fi@@ f@@ teen , and their views on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 are very much at vari@@ ance with those held by the new Member States .
the first problem I would like to highlight is the siz@@ e of the budget for the period in question .
the six so @-@ called net contribu@@ tors ar@@ gue for 1 % of G@@ DP , where@@ as the Prodi Commission proposed 1.@@ 14 % of G@@ DP .
according to estima@@ tes , in absolu@@ te terms this amounts to a difference of about EUR 1@@ 80 billion , which means around EUR 25 billion less for each year of this Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
this is an enormous su@@ m from the point of view of the new Member States .
it is a su@@ m that is absolutely essential to reduce the differences in development between old and new Member States , and to ensure that the div@@ ision into a first and second clas@@ s Europe does not become perman@@ ently entr@@ en@@ ched .
the second problem I should like to refer to concerns the resources for Structural Funds and the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund .
I refer in particular to their alloc@@ ation to regions in the old Union affected by the &apos; statis@@ tical effect . &quot;
the Commission is show@@ ing remar@@ ka@@ ble gener@@ os@@ ity towards these regions . there are plans to alloc@@ ate no less than EUR 19@@ 4 billion to them over these next se@@ ven years , but only EUR 18@@ 1 billion to regions in the new Union .
it should be bor@@ ne in mind that this period will see the accession of at least two new Member States , and that the whole of the territory of the 12 new countries is eli@@ gible for support .
the third problem I wish to mention concerns lim@@ iting resources from the Structural Funds and the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Fund to 4 % of the G@@ DP of the Member State in question .
for the ten new Member States this means an annual total of less than EUR 20 billion .
I believe it would be appropriate to raise the th@@ res@@ hold to at least 5 % of the G@@ DP of the Member State .
I very much hope the Commissioner will take the three concerns I mentioned into account .
Mr President , let me raise a few issues from the perspective of a new Member State .
first , the new financial framework should be dri@@ ven by the political priorities of the enlarged Union and the principle of solidarity among the Member States .
second , the own @-@ resources c@@ eil@@ ing should be established at a level that would assure the successful integration of the new Member States in the Union and take account of commitments ente@@ red into during the accession negotiations .
third , it is my firm beli@@ ef that we , the European Parliament , have to support high alloc@@ ations for the Lisbon strategy measures from the Commission &apos;s budget .
a clear mechanism sec@@ uring a certain share of funds for each Member State should be designed for funding this priority .
I should also like to point out that the funding of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should not be at the expen@@ se of EU cohesion policy .
the assistance planned for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy objectives should add to , rather than re@@ place , the assistance under the cohesion policy , as competitiveness and cohesion are mu@@ tually reinfor@@ cing .
four@@ th , from the point of view of less @-@ developed econom@@ ies in the EU , the level of financial assistance should be propor@@ tional to countries &apos; current economic level of development .
in any case the assistance rate per cap@@ ita should not be higher in the more prosper@@ ous Member States than in the less @-@ developed ones .
fif@@ th , we should also consider that the lim@@ itation of structural assistance through the c@@ app@@ ing rule , if it is applied in the next program@@ ming period , could , in some cases , s@@ low down the social and economic conver@@ g@@ ence of the least @-@ developed Member States , by direc@@ ting cohesion policy resources to more developed Member States and regions .
last but not least , the Commission rightly pointed out that an enlarged EU requires more money .
it is impossible to overcome the challenges of an enlarged and ever @-@ enlarg@@ ing Europe with less money .
Mr President , it is important that we be given the opportunity of discussing the financial framework in good time and of voting on it in the parliamentary committees at reg@@ ular inter@@ val@@ s .
that is particularly true in the case of cohesion policy and regional policy .
in the past , in fact , regional policy has been extremely effective .
the dis@@ par@@ ities in Europe have le@@ ve@@ lled out to a large extent , and , in the light of new key initiatives , especially the Lisbon agenda , this policy should certainly be continued .
this can only be done , however , if this Parliament , in consultation with the Commission and the Council , la@@ ys down the new regulations in good time .
in concrete terms , this means that by the m@@ iddle of next year , mid @-@ 2005 , we should be able to take a decision on this , fail@@ ing which we will have a repeat of what happened in 1999 when the debates were too l@@ eng@@ thy and implementation had to be cut short .
the Lisbon agenda requires per@@ sever@@ ance on the part of the national governments and of those involved in the regions .
this means that we must be ready in time , and , from that point of view , car@@ rying the whole thing over to the second half of 2006 , under the British Presidency , would be d@@ et@@ r@@ imen@@ tal to the policy .
in short , I should like to emphasise the importance of regional policy in the context of the Lisbon objectives , innovation , promotion of competition and the new second budget objective , par@@ tly because this can promote cooperation in regions and cooperation between partners .
let me say , turning to the financial perspec@@ tives , that the 1 % does , of course , make them impossible .
another factor that pla@@ ys a role in this is that we have lear@@ ned that implementation was closer to the people in a dec@@ entr@@ alised setting in con@@ jun@@ ction with prov@@ inc@@ es , regions , c@@ ities , social partners in the regions in Europe , and greater involvement was the result .
if 1 % were to cul@@ min@@ ate in a ren@@ a@@ tion@@ alisation of policy , we would mis@@ s the European added value , and I would find that very regretta@@ ble .
thank you very much .
that brings us to the end of the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not intend to take the floor .
the debate is therefore closed .
we feel that the Commission &apos;s proposal for the next Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives is clearly not sufficient to address the current social , economic and environmental challenges , the need for economic and social cohesion - which has increased with enlargement - and the high levels of unemployment and poverty in the EU .
qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tively , what is being proposed is actually an average of 1.@@ 0@@ 9 % of Community G@@ N@@ I , which is less than Agenda 2000 ( 1.@@ 10 % ) and previous ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks ; qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tively , the priorities are &apos; competitiveness , &quot; &apos; ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ uri@@ al spirit &quot; and &apos; security and defence &quot; at the expen@@ se of development , cooperation and cohesion .
one might ask in this debate whether Barroso reinfor@@ ces and exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates Prodi , given that statements from Commissioners pa@@ ve the way towards negotiating , or rene@@ goti@@ ating , bel@@ ow the already ina@@ dequate package , in line with the sig@@ n@@ ator@@ ies of the &apos; L@@ et@@ ter of the six , &quot; who intend to impose a c@@ eil@@ ing of 1 % of Community G@@ N@@ I on the budget , something to which we have always been opposed .
we therefore wish to make it clear that we reject the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives , of which the average annual spending fall@@ s between the Commission &apos;s proposal and the c@@ eil@@ ing of the &apos; L@@ et@@ ter of the six , &quot; which I mentioned earlier , and is moving ever closer to that c@@ eil@@ ing .
lastly , we support the idea of re@@ tain@@ ing the se@@ ven @-@ year financial framework , given that , even in this area , the ten@@ d@@ ency is to &apos; negoti@@ ate &quot; do@@ w@@ n@@ wards .
the next item is the report ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 5@@ 1 / 2004 ) by Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t on behalf of the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin &#91; 2004 / 2@@ 12@@ 1 ( IN@@ I ) &#93; .
the debate is open .
Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t has the floor .
. Mr President , I would like to start by thanking all the sha@@ dow rapporteurs and the draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their interest and their commitment with regard to this report .
I am sure that we would all have lik@@ ed more committee time , not least to have deb@@ ated the amendments presented in committee and the overall content more thorou@@ gh@@ ly , as I am aware that certain difficulties still remain .
but there is a great deal on which the majority of us from the committee agree and I trust the Council and the Commission will remember that .
we welcome the Commission &apos;s two commun@@ ications as an important step in the development of a common asylum policy .
we support the stress on measures such as the res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement programmes , protected entry procedures and support in the region as being additional and compl@@ ementary to the existing rights to seek asylum within the European Union , and agree that those internal asylum systems should be of high quality .
we agree that we do not view the out@@ s@@ our@@ cing of internal EU responsibilities to cam@@ ps in countries such as Li@@ by@@ a as offer@@ ing any sustainable solution , or even a short @-@ term solution , to those seeking asylum .
as regards the single procedure , we recognise that it is better both for the asylum applic@@ ant and the authorities if all relevant information is examin@@ ed at one time , and we welcome the fact that the Commission has laid out a common order of decision @-@ making .
however , we also recognise the possible protection ga@@ p in those Member States that only emplo@@ y full refuge@@ e status and have no practice of subsidi@@ ary protection , compared with Member States using both categ@@ or@@ ies .
I recognise that this is a difficult issue for some Members and that paragrap@@ h@@ s 37 and 38 of the report may seem to pre @-@ emp@@ t the re@@ consultation process on the procedures directive in which we hope Parliament will be involved very shor@@ tly .
I would welcome the views of Members on the possible los@@ s of those paragrap@@ h@@ s .
Parliament , however , fully agre@@ es with the need to fron@@ t@@ lo@@ ad the decision @-@ making process .
we support the need for the better use of in @-@ country information by better @-@ tra@@ ined staff .
it is app@@ all@@ ing that some@@ one &apos;s life should depen@@ d on an opinion that was never tes@@ ted for its ver@@ ac@@ ity .
this is the situation facing R@@ am@@ z@@ i Is@@ al@@ am , a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Alger@@ ian man who may be de@@ ported from the UK to Alger@@ ia as he is de@@ em@@ ed not to be in need of subsidi@@ ary protection .
this is due to a line in a Can@@ a@@ di@@ an diplom@@ at &apos;s report some years ago , which is still included in the country information the UK uses .
all the other opinions of that diplom@@ at have been dele@@ ted over time .
the EU has to do better than that in terms of the quality of the information we use to decide on people &apos;s lives .
more contro@@ versi@@ ally , the majority view in committee was that we need to have in place some form of monitoring or report @-@ back system on what happens to those who are re@@ turned having made un@@ successful claim@@ s for protection .
then we might know if it is really safe to return others .
the committee fully supports the need for a better coordin@@ ated approach to support in the region for the vas@@ t majority of the world &apos;s refugees who never even try to come to the European Union , contrary to many new@@ s@@ paper reports and some politicians &apos; views .
we recognise that such coordination is a challenge , but a pi@@ ec@@ em@@ e@@ al approach cre@@ ates con@@ fu@@ sion .
we want to know how the Commission proposes to improve such coordination in future .
we also agree that we need new money , not a re@@ alloc@@ ation of existing aid bud@@ gets , to offer any long @-@ term support to help improve capacity and the quality of response in the regions of origin in full cooperation with the countries concerned .
what else do we agree on ?
we agree that res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement programmes can be of great value , especially when they ca@@ ter for those most at risk in an already prec@@ ar@@ ious situation ; that these programmes can be used within the European Union to help develop a public understanding as to why refugees seek protection ; and that this understanding can help to combat all forms of discrimination , not least rac@@ ism and x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
we also agree that we need a common foreign and security policy that comm@@ its the EU as a matter of priority to conflict prevention and the resolution of long @-@ term conflicts .
in that context we welcome the proposed EU regional protection programmes and wish to be involved in their development and assessment .
as you can see , there is much that we agree on and that is not in dispu@@ te in this debate .
whatever the final vote tomorrow , that is the message I would wish us to con@@ ve@@ y to both the Council and the Commission .
we agree that the Commission &apos;s du@@ al approach - to aim for a univers@@ ally high standard of application of the current directives within the EU and to improve the conditions for the vas@@ t majority of refugees within the region they are fle@@ eing - is a reasonable and indeed ambitious programme .
Parliament will wish to be fully involved in the development of such initiatives .
. Mr President , Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t &apos;s report s@@ ets the two commun@@ ications in the framework of achieving a common European asylum system .
in the asylum c@@ hap@@ ter of the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme the objective of a common European asylum system is fully confirmed and an ambitious dead@@ line of 2010 is set for the re@@ alisation of that goal .
the Commission will ensure that the dead@@ line is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task .
as of s@@ pring 2005 the European Parliament will be a co @-@ legisla@@ tor in the process necessary to bring this about .
the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme also reflec@@ ts the fact that the external dimension of asylum is being recognised as increasingly important in the EU .
the improvement of the global protection system is something that can benefit refugees the world over and can help to better share out the responsibilities for refugees with those countries that ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date the greater part of the refuge@@ e population .
that is also in the EU &apos;s interest .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for recogn@@ ising the importance of this work and the financial implications involved .
the full support of the European Parliament is required .
the du@@ ra@@ ble solutions communication explo@@ res how the EU can enhan@@ ce protection capac@@ ities in regions of origin and also help ensure more or@@ der@@ ly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection through the setting @-@ up of an EU @-@ wide res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement scheme .
refugees should be able to access protection as quickly as possible and as closely as possible to their needs .
the emphasis here is on burden shar@@ ing rather than burden shi@@ f@@ ting , on expl@@ or@@ ing with third countries how we can work together to address a common challenge .
these plans must be entirely compl@@ ementary to , and not a sub@@ stitu@@ te for , Member States &apos; obligations under international human rights law , and in particular the 19@@ 5@@ 1 Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e Convention and the right to asylum in the European Union .
the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme is clear that the implementation of the second phase of the common European asylum system must be based on a ro@@ b@@ ust evaluation of the impact of the measures taken in Member States .
our communication indic@@ ates a meth@@ od@@ ology for taking that evaluation forward and for how practical cooperation should be developed .
that coll@@ abor@@ ative and consensus @-@ dri@@ ven meth@@ od@@ ology can also be applied to other areas under the asylum and mi@@ gration .
for the longer term we should encourage and promote further cooperation among Member States in this field .
that is what the Commission intends to do .
. Mr President , the key to this integrated and comprehensive approach to asylum and mi@@ gration is the cooperation of third countries , which will be invi@@ ted to work in partnership and share responsibility with us to ensure that this well thought @-@ out policy succ@@ eed@@ s .
this cooperation should be s@@ ought through existing instruments , including , in particular , the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy .
the EU must not be seen by third countries as - and here you were right , Commissioner - trying to shi@@ ft its own responsibilities from our sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders to the@@ ir@@ s .
to this end we must demonstrate , in a visi@@ ble manner , our read@@ in@@ ess to assis@@ t these countries in enhan@@ cing their protection capacity , to be better prepared to provide urgent assistance to countries in crisis , and to ensure the necessary budgetary means other than those already en@@ vis@@ aged as development aid .
par@@ all@@ el to third countries , we must be seen to be ready to assu@@ me our own responsibilities : the creation of a common European asylum system as called for at Tamper@@ e , a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged regional protection programme by December 2005 , and a res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement scheme based on the ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion capacity of individual Member States .
finally , enhan@@ cing protection capacity in creating protected entry procedures does not mean ab@@ an@@ don@@ ing the existing right of application for asylum on s@@ pon@@ ta@@ ne@@ ous arri@@ val in an EU Member State .
I am firmly of the beli@@ ef that the more the EU succ@@ eed@@ s in enhan@@ cing protection capacity in the regions of origin and the more it assis@@ ts third countries in bringing protection capacity up to standard , the more the protected entry procedures from outside the EU will be enhan@@ ced ; the fe@@ wer s@@ pon@@ ta@@ ne@@ ous asylum claim@@ s will be presented directly to Member States ; and the less lu@@ cra@@ tive the trade of trafficking in human beings will become .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since the Tamper@@ e European Council included amongst its objectives the creation of a common asylum system , Parliament - including the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats - has been fully committed to that objective and to the European Union &apos;s intention to respond to those people who come to our countries legitim@@ ately in se@@ ar@@ ch of better lives and a better future .
today , and with our si@@ ghts set on 2010 , the date established in the H@@ ag@@ ue programme for compl@@ et@@ ing the second phase of the common asylum system , we are faced with the for@@ tun@@ ate fact that the European Union has already adopted important rules , but there is still a long way to go and we are committed to doing so .
our actions should be character@@ ised by responsibility and ri@@ g@@ our .
when we are talking about human beings who need our help we cannot act in any other way .
we are dealing with an important report which I believe has the fundamental mer@@ it of offer@@ ing a clear and decisive view of certain issues : firstly , Parliament is saying a firm &apos; no &quot; to the proposal to create rec@@ ep@@ tion cam@@ ps in countries outside the Union .
the responsibility I spoke about a moment ago cannot be e@@ va@@ ded ; we cannot deal with those people looking to us to respond to their des@@ pa@@ ir by looking the other way .
keeping asylum see@@ kers outside of our borders is not the best way to demonstrate the val@@ id@@ ity of the values on which the European Union is based .
secondly , we ask that assistance for refugees be based on the principle of solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibility .
once again , we can see that only solidarity and joint action by the Union can provide vi@@ able and las@@ ting solutions .
once again , the Union has the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to a genuinely common asylum system .
finally , we express our support for a system of res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement at Community level , but one which always re@@ conc@@ il@@ es the will of the State and that of the individual in question .
for all of these reasons - although right now we have just one difficul@@ ty with the rapporteur - whose ability to re@@ conc@@ ile positions we very much appreciate and who we thank - only if the problem separ@@ ating us , with regard to so @-@ called safe third countries , is resolved , will we be able to vote in favour of this report .
Mr President , my Group supports this report wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly because we believe that a common asylum procedure is something that many across this House talk about , but the reality of actually making it happen requires support of the Lam@@ ber@@ t report .
it is difficult to go from the position of saying that we want burden shar@@ ing , a common asylum policy and to support the Tamper@@ e agenda , to the practical application of that in a report which mo@@ ves forward some of the things that we want to see .
as some@@ one who dealt with asylum cases for many years , I see the Lam@@ ber@@ t report as a prog@@ res@@ sive report , but one which can be supported across this House .
we talk about good asylum decisions .
it is a problem in every Member State that asylum decision @-@ making is so poor that we are not ser@@ ved well in terms of allowing genuine asylum see@@ kers to make a case and actually enter a country .
that is bad for all of us .
poor asylum decision @-@ making is addressed in this report .
we want to step up protection capacity in regions of origin and we are defin@@ ing in this report the difference between tr@@ ansi@@ t cam@@ ps and out@@ s@@ our@@ cing our responsibilities to third countries , and regional protection .
I want to regis@@ ter our support for this report .
.
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t for her report .
I agree with Mr Mor@@ a@@ es .
my Group fully supports the report .
most of what I would like to say has already been mentioned by Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t in an excellent way .
however , I should like to point out that there are ten@@ sions between the two directives .
the Qu@@ ali@@ fications Directive s@@ ets standards for refuge@@ e status and subsidi@@ ary protection .
there is a need for the directive on minimum standards on procedures to be adopted to come into line with the other directive .
that is not the case at the moment .
second , the issue of res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement should be supported because it is aimed at the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able .
it is not another path of economic mi@@ gration .
it gives hope .
at the moment only six Member States take advantage of the possibility to take refugees under res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement schem@@ es , but voluntary de@@ als with the refugees will help both them and the UN@@ H@@ C@@ R , which warm@@ ly supports res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement .
finally , we should be clear that res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement and protected entry procedures are not an exc@@ use for cu@@ tting back on the rights of asylum @-@ see@@ kers arri@@ ving s@@ pon@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously in the European Union Member States .
.
Mr President , over these past few years , thousands of people - men , women and children - have passed through my home to@@ wn of C@@ ala@@ is , or through the no@@ tor@@ ious S@@ ang@@ at@@ te cam@@ p , having been per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed that they will find their E@@ l D@@ or@@ ad@@ o in the United Kingdom : Koso@@ var@@ s , Afgh@@ ans , Iraq@@ is , S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese , K@@ ur@@ ds - people in se@@ ar@@ ch of freedom and security , simple citizens of the world , dri@@ ven by mis@@ er@@ y to take to the road , wis@@ hing only , like every one of us , for a bit of happ@@ in@@ ess .
allow me to assure them of our solidarity .
Europeans must know that there is a better standard of living here than in Africa and , in particular , that it is possible for people to work here ille@@ g@@ ally if they are prepared to ear@@ n less and keep qui@@ et .
in Europe , there are those who at@@ trac@@ t , explo@@ it and get rich by eng@@ ag@@ ing in this s@@ la@@ ve trade .
yes , we need to restor@@ e the hon@@ our of Europe , which is all too often su@@ ll@@ ied , just as we must urge the Union to stop bur@@ ying its head in the s@@ and on the pre@@ text that talking about immigration fu@@ els nation@@ alist s@@ enti@@ ments .
Europe , however , must not be the s@@ ole focus of our attention in this respect . the I@@ M@@ F , whose recommendations are often responsible for mass em@@ i@@ gra@@ tions , the United Nations and the office of its Hi@@ gh Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es also have a part to play .
yes , the European Union should have an asylum policy that accor@@ ds with the principles of the European Human Rights Convention .
yes , the European Union should examine the em@@ i@@ gration issue in de@@ p@@ th .
yes , the European Union should remember that some of the children within its own territory are stric@@ ken by hun@@ ger too .
.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report expres@@ ses in a@@ po@@ dic@@ tic terms a rejec@@ tion in advan@@ ce of any question of setting up the so @-@ called rec@@ ep@@ tion c@@ ent@@ res in countries of final tr@@ ansi@@ t proposed by several parties .
it is said that setting up such c@@ ent@@ res would lead to difficulties in compl@@ ying with international human rights obligations , but I do not know on what assu@@ mp@@ tions this statement is based .
I wonder whether the rapporteur has already as@@ certain@@ ed that the leaders of such countries or the NGOs , including the European ones , operating in the countries of origin and tr@@ ansi@@ t of immigrants are not willing to cooperate .
I think that this pre@@ concep@@ tion is based sol@@ ely on ide@@ ological grounds , since rec@@ ep@@ tion c@@ ent@@ res could certainly play an important role in meeting both the need to carry out the necessary controls and that of human@@ e treatment of mi@@ grants .
in fact , the ref@@ us@@ al to create such c@@ ent@@ res lea@@ ves the situation un@@ changed , and h@@ ind@@ ers the welcome involvement of countries of tr@@ ansi@@ t in the management of the mi@@ gration process .
the centre that was recently set up in Africa , thanks to important intervention by my country through the T@@ ri@@ pol@@ i agreements , has already managed to prevent , at least so far , the Mediterranean c@@ ros@@ s@@ ings by des@@ per@@ ate people in the traffic@@ kers &quot; old tu@@ bs and the resul@@ ting tragic ship@@ w@@ rec@@ ks .
its creation has thus made it possible to achieve a positive outcome in the fight against the des@@ pic@@ able trafficking in human beings .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , asylum is not a technical issue .
it needs to be recognised for what it is , namely a political and social issue .
for the past few dec@@ ad@@ es , the Member States of the European Union have given little thought to asylum policy , particularly regarding individuals from other contin@@ ents .
the disas@@ tro@@ us consequences of this approach are now ev@@ ident .
rac@@ ist and political extre@@ mis@@ m has become ri@@ f@@ e , affec@@ ting both new@@ com@@ ers and local people .
in addition , this in@@ appropriate asylum policy has wea@@ ken@@ ed the confidence of many soci@@ eties in European integration .
rightly or wr@@ ong@@ ly , this integration is linked to an exces@@ sively liber@@ al policy on asylum .
clearly , such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue .
the right balance must be maintained between human rights , democracy and the safety of citizen .
I am pleased to note that in the second point of its resolution , the European Parliament emphas@@ ises the need for &apos; measures to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin &#91; of potential asylum see@@ kers &#93; . &quot;
this is entirely appropriate .
in conclusion , Mr President , I should like to emphasise that the problem of asylum is b@@ ound to increase , given the rela@@ tive we@@ alth of Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as Members of the European Parliament we sit in this Chamber repres@@ enting the citizens of the 25 nations that make up the European Union .
in the Union this Parliament is the only institution elected by univers@@ al su@@ ff@@ ra@@ ge .
in so far as we are the vehicles for direct consensus and have a mandate from the people , for certain issues we must succeed in c@@ as@@ ting off the political ide@@ olog@@ ies to which we sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be .
immigration ought to be one of these issues .
history te@@ ac@@ hes us that the greatest mis@@ for@@ tun@@ e for human beings is to be u@@ pro@@ o@@ ted from their place of origin , and that immigration ar@@ ises for coun@@ t@@ less reasons , not all of them voluntary .
a developed social system - and the European Union is a collec@@ tion of developed states - cannot rule out some aspects of this p@@ hen@@ omen@@ on and focus sol@@ ely on the em@@ o@@ tive part .
the Union must safeguard the fundamental principles on which its existence is based , but it must do so in a way that benefits everyone , both its own citizens and those of third countries .
it must do so through a common policy , with cho@@ ices that are mu@@ tually agreed upon and maintained , and not by means of ine@@ ffec@@ tive initiatives which is@@ ol@@ ate certain Member States .
if there must be a single immigration policy , then all its consequences must be accepted , above all at times like these when there are de@@ ep concerns regarding internal security .
among other things , it is important not to rule out the organisation of an immigration information and prepar@@ ation system in countries of origin and tr@@ ansi@@ t .
such a system should be organised and mu@@ tually agreed on and , if added to economic aid and inc@@ enti@@ ves in the areas of origin , could provide positive results for all .
this proposal does not take this approach to the issue , not even in practical terms , and that is why we cannot support it unless appropriate amendments are adopted .
Mr President , I must begin by thanking our rapporteur , Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t , for this excellent report , which has our support .
we have , in fact , reached a critical jun@@ c@@ ture in the for@@ mu@@ lation of a European asylum policy .
it is obser@@ va@@ ble that the first phase of European harmonisation of national asylum policies has resul@@ ted in a le@@ ve@@ lling @-@ down of standards .
in November of this year , the Council adopted a new set of priorities for a European asylum policy in the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme .
among the provisions of this programme for the second phase of harmonisation is the development of a common asylum procedure , and our main message here is that Europe is a place of refu@@ ge and that we must preser@@ ve that humanitarian tradition .
in this context , the fore@@ most aim of the report before us is to remind the Member States that the Gen@@ eva Convention and the role of the Hi@@ gh Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es must remain at the heart of our asylum policy .
in order to preser@@ ve Europe &apos;s humanitarian tradition , we form@@ ally re@@ aff@@ ir@@ m our opposition to any mo@@ ves to out@@ source the application process and to create tr@@ ansi@@ t cam@@ ps beyond the fron@@ ti@@ ers of the European Union .
European asylum policy must be based on the principle of solidarity , of shared bur@@ d@@ ens and responsibilities , not only in@@ side the European Union but also with non @-@ EU countries .
a European asylum policy must also reinfor@@ ce the fundamental rights of asylum see@@ kers .
the primary aim of the single asylum procedure must be to guarantee a high level of protection for refugees .
it must also provide scope for improved decision @-@ making .
the European Parliament , democra@@ tically elected and accoun@@ table to the peoples of Europe , must aff@@ ir@@ m the right of asylum see@@ kers to a dig@@ ni@@ fied rec@@ ep@@ tion .
we want more acc@@ es@@ sible , fa@@ ire@@ r and better organised asylum systems , and we must rec@@ ti@@ fy the def@@ ec@@ ts in the present systems .
we must protect refugees , and we must also work on our own popula@@ tions , expla@@ ining to them the dist@@ ress that dri@@ ves people to seek refu@@ ge in Europe and , by this means , fos@@ tering a better understanding of the situation .
it is , of course , des@@ ira@@ ble that refugees return to their own countries .
to that end , it will be necessary to deal with the under@@ lying causes of their p@@ light .
in the mean@@ time , however , it is our duty to focus on the local integration of refugees and on their ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ation in h@@ ost countries while up@@ gra@@ ding protection capa@@ bilities and developing a programme for the development and adoption of sustainable solutions .
lastly , there seems to be a problem with the interpre@@ tation of Amendment No 1 in several languages .
let me therefore make it clear that the word &apos; based &quot; ref@@ ers to the pre@@ ma@@ ture re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ation of refugees , not to the safegu@@ ards designed to strengthen the protection programmes .
I felt it was important to clarify that point .
Mr President , I conc@@ ur with the many war@@ m words that have been spoken by a number of Members , and I too would ask for your support for this excellent report .
we are faced with a very har@@ ro@@ wing problem for which a solution is required as a matter of urgency .
that solution should , however , be a real and permanent one rather than a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft attempt .
what is really required in the long term is , of course , legal immigration in the European Union ; from that point of view , the Council has mis@@ sed an opportunity by deliber@@ ately exclu@@ ding legal immigration from qualified majority voting .
it would appear that the Member States find it easier to reach agreement on how to keep people outside of the EU than on how we can properly allow them in .
over the past few weeks and months , the EU and Parliament have discussed European values and human rights at great l@@ eng@@ th , particularly in the debate on the Commission , but also again today in connection with Turkey .
our civil@@ isation &apos;s standards are measu@@ red against the manner in which we deal with our fellow human beings and trans@@ late our values into practice .
asylum see@@ kers are not crimin@@ als ; they are fellow human beings and should , accord@@ ingly , be received under human@@ e conditions .
they deser@@ ve our support , and I , therefore , endorse this report .
the world ass@@ esses the European Union &apos;s commitment to equality , justice and fair @-@ play by the way it treat@@ s those fle@@ eing war and per@@ secu@@ tion .
Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t is to be strongly com@@ mend@@ ed for her report and for the focus that it gives to the humanitarian and the civil rights issues which li@@ e at the heart of the asylum debate .
I ech@@ o her call for the highest possible international standards and human rights to gu@@ ide EU policy .
her rejec@@ tion of the so @-@ called &apos; holding c@@ ent@@ res &apos; , even as a short @-@ term solution to the issue of dealing with asylum applic@@ ants , is to be welcomed and strongly endor@@ sed .
the emphasis in the report on spe@@ eding up asylum requests and ensuring efficiency and transparency in the decision @-@ making process is also welcome .
conflict , poverty and soci@@ o @-@ political ins@@ tability affect millions of people across the world .
we therefore need to shi@@ ft the emphasis towards promoting conflict resolution and prevention under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of the United Nations .
the long @-@ term solution to issues of asylum is to reduce conflict and poverty glob@@ ally .
the EU has a major role to play in this regard . we must get the policy right .
we must demonstrate to the world that when it comes to human rights , justice and equality , the policy implementation of the EU is as good as its r@@ het@@ or@@ ic .
I also strongly support the amendments .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I recognise myself in the Lam@@ ber@@ t report , because , if there is an enem@@ y preventing Europe from growing , that enem@@ y is fear .
one of the ways of combating it is certainly by know@@ ing how to recognise those who deser@@ ve help among those who turn to us for assistance .
not long ago , 75 E@@ r@@ it@@ re@@ ans were ar@@ res@@ ted by the Li@@ by@@ an authorities ; they had to under@@ go a long period of de@@ ten@@ tion and were sub@@ jec@@ ted to in@@ human@@ e treatment .
they were then put on an a@@ er@@ op@@ lan@@ e to be taken back to their country of origin .
se@@ iz@@ ed by des@@ pa@@ ir , they hi@@ j@@ ac@@ ked the a@@ er@@ op@@ lan@@ e and forced it to land in S@@ ud@@ an .
the United Nations Hi@@ gh Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es was able to inter@@ view 60 of the 75 E@@ r@@ it@@ re@@ ans , since the others were in pris@@ on for the hi@@ j@@ ac@@ king .
all those inter@@ vie@@ wed were entitled to asylum , but Li@@ by@@ a does not have a law recogn@@ ising such a right , is not a sig@@ n@@ atory to the Gen@@ eva Convention and does not guarantee respect of human rights in pris@@ on .
on the other hand , even countries such as min@@ e - Italy - do not have a law on the right to asylum , and therefore reject mi@@ grants in@@ dis@@ cr@@ im@@ ina@@ tely , without examin@@ ing appl@@ ications and without fair , just and individual assess@@ ments .
even legal immigrants are hu@@ mili@@ ated and forced to wait for years for the ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ful renew@@ al of their resid@@ ence per@@ m@@ its .
it is clear that these persons are considered an enem@@ y within , to be treated b@@ ad@@ ly and th@@ ro@@ wn out .
Europe itself , though , should examine asylum appl@@ ications , at the same time helping the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b countries to progress along the path of respec@@ ting rights .
we should ensure that Europe , by using the highest criteria for assess@@ ing and protecting refugees , trans@@ forms these wa@@ ves of people into legal immigrants , and this plan is both bene@@ fic@@ ial and possible .
for this reason it is necessary to set up a single European agency for refugees and European rec@@ ep@@ tion c@@ ent@@ res to examine individual requests , providing legal and l@@ ing@@ uis@@ tic assistance .
the refugees will be our fore@@ most all@@ ies in promoting economic , civil and democratic growth in their countries of origin , since the world will be more secure only when it sto@@ ps being so un@@ fair .
thank you very much .
that conclu@@ des the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor .
the debate is therefore closed .
the vote will take place on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day at 12 noon .
the next item is the report ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 6@@ 7 / 2004 ) by Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia on behalf of the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs , contain@@ ing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union drugs strategy ( 2005 @-@ 20@@ 12 ) &#91; 2004 / 2@@ 2@@ 21 ( IN@@ I ) &#93; .
I should like to give the floor to Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia , the rapporteur .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy , which is on the agenda for debate , ought to operate exclu@@ sively through a scientific approach , through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue buil@@ t up over recent years .
in contr@@ ast , unfortunately , the argument is all too often per@@ me@@ ated with ide@@ olog@@ ies and do@@ g@@ matic or em@@ o@@ tive appro@@ ac@@ hes .
the data available to us allow us to take a practical approach .
I refer , in particular , to the data sup@@ pli@@ ed to us by the European Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ru@@ gs and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ dic@@ tion , based in Lisbon .
as is well @-@ known , these data are not only of high scientific value but also of prov@@ en reli@@ ability .
all this une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally demonstra@@ tes that the strateg@@ ies adopted up to now have not had positive results .
with regard to drug use in pris@@ ons , the C@@ en@@ tre indic@@ ates that drug users are over @-@ represented in pris@@ on ; that the use of drugs among deta@@ ine@@ es ran@@ ges from 22 to 8@@ 6 % , depen@@ ding on the pris@@ on population , the pris@@ on and the country ; and that pris@@ ons are a high @-@ risk environment for the s@@ pread of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous diseases .
with regard to the crimin@@ alisation of drug use , the C@@ en@@ tre expla@@ ins that in many Member States the process of crimin@@ alis@@ ing the use of n@@ ar@@ co@@ tics has led to an increase in the use of these substances .
I should point out to my Swedish fellow Members that the C@@ en@@ tre &apos;s report contains a specific reference to the situation in Sweden , where a study is ci@@ ted which shows that with the repres@@ sive strateg@@ ies in force in that country the drug market has inten@@ si@@ fied ; it conclu@@ des that there is no specific pro@@ of for the argument that the crimin@@ alisation of drug use has a de@@ terr@@ ent effect on young people .
finally , with regard to drug trafficking , Europol indic@@ ates that n@@ ar@@ co@@ tics trafficking accounts for appro@@ xim@@ ately 2 to 5 % of world G@@ DP , which goes directly into the hands of drug traffic@@ kers and large criminal organisations wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide .
the US drugs agency estima@@ tes that in 2005 Afghanistan will export over five thou@@ s@@ and t@@ ons of op@@ ium , of which 95 % will end up in Europe .
this demonstra@@ tes that the action plan adopted by the UN in 1998 has not had positive results , and this is also true in terms of the importance of drugs in funding organised crime and terrorism .
a pro@@ min@@ ent prosecu@@ tor , Ger@@ ar@@ do D &apos;@@ A@@ mb@@ ro@@ si@@ o , has expla@@ ined to us that to finance the Mad@@ rid attack the A@@ l @-@ Qu@@ a@@ ida terrorists bar@@ tered 2@@ 50 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of has@@ h@@ ish for the T@@ N@@ T .
our report , which has been adopted by the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs , is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking , organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to sa@@ ving lives and protecting health .
the issue must not be treated as a question of public order or a matter for repres@@ sion , but exclu@@ sively as a social and economic issue .
I therefore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report , on the Commission to back it and on the Council - which is unfortunately ab@@ sent , having clearly already made up its mind - to consider including this recommendation on the agenda for the meeting to be held in three days &quot; time .
I would also like to mention that this recommendation was put together with the support of many organisations .
.
Mr President , Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia , as you know , the new drugs strategy for the period from 2005 to 20@@ 12 that is to be endor@@ sed by the European Council is the first anti @-@ drugs strategy for the enlarged Union .
it is based on an assessment of the previous strategy , which the Commission carried out back in October .
the European approach , which fav@@ ours a balance between demand @-@ reduction and supply @-@ reduction measures , therefore cover@@ s 25 countries .
this strategy clearly addres@@ ses the need to enhan@@ ce coordination within the Union as well as to raise the prof@@ ile of EU efforts in other countries .
the princi@@ p@@ al aims laid down in the strategy will be trans@@ la@@ ted into specific actions in the two succ@@ es@@ sive four @-@ year action plans , which , as you are aware , will be proposed by the Commission at the start of 2005 and the start of 200@@ 9 respec@@ tively .
the Commission intends to adopt its proposal for an action plan in February 2005 .
it believes that Parliament &apos;s contribution in an area such as the drugs issue is essential as a means of bringing European policy closer to the people .
what we need , in other words , is a shared European political strategy .
rest assu@@ red that the Commission will not fal@@ ter in its commitment to this approach .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I can inform you that the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats cannot l@@ end its support to the draft recommendation we are discussing today , because it does not provide answ@@ ers to the major challenges on which the EU should focus its future drugs strategy .
recent figures about drug use among young people are al@@ arm@@ ing .
an increasing number of young people start exper@@ im@@ enting , and at an ever @-@ youn@@ ger age , with so@@ ft drugs , in particular , which are made ever more acc@@ es@@ sible by the fall@@ ing prices for them .
I believe that the rapporteur , in his report , is minim@@ ising the problem , and I see this as clearly in@@ appropriate in this situation .
on the contrary , the situation requires a b@@ old and comprehensive approach with only one goal in mind : that of reducing the use of drugs and all their adver@@ se consequences .
the Commission &apos;s assessment report and the annual report of the European Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ru@@ gs and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ dic@@ tion prove that a great deal is yet to be done , including at European level .
the European policy should , as the Commissioner stated , add value to the differ@@ enti@@ ated approach in the different Member States in terms of coordination , information , scientific research and the tac@@ kl@@ ing of the cross @-@ border drugs trade and crime that goes hand in hand with that .
we believe that , if such a policy is to be adopted , a separate budget line should be created for supporting new initiatives and promoting the exchange of useful experience between the various Member States .
nothing of the sort is to be found in this report .
far from it ; it is in@@ coherent and rid@@ d@@ led with contradic@@ tions .
for example , it calls for an approach based on facts and scientific research - something that we can , of course , support - while , in the same bre@@ ath , drawing conclusions most of which are incor@@ rec@@ t .
it claim@@ s that repres@@ sion has no benefits , and that past action has failed to bear any fru@@ it .
moreover , it ju@@ mp@@ s to conclusions as to what should be done .
finally , the European Council will be determin@@ ing the strategy this week , and Parliament ...
. Mr President , this is an excellent report which we on this side of the House support .
we support it for many of the reasons which the previous speak@@ er mentioned , including in terms of the sci@@ ence and p@@ ra@@ g@@ matic facts of this debate .
we do not take an over@@ tly ide@@ ological stan@@ ce , but there is some ide@@ ology in the debate and the ide@@ ology says that , unless we deal with har@@ m reduction , unless we understand add@@ ic@@ tion and unless we understand the explo@@ sion in crime which lead@@ s from drugs to the domestic crime that we su@@ ffer in all of our European Union Member States , we cannot tackle the problem effici@@ ently and effectively .
this report - which was a much amended report with appro@@ xim@@ ately 10@@ 6 amendments in committee - shows two things .
one is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drugs strategy .
secondly we all know as MEPs that there is a very strong public app@@ et@@ ite for there to be an EU strategy .
so what is that strategy to be ?
the answer to that question is very much contained in this report .
for example , in this report we talk not about being hard on drugs or so@@ ft on drugs , but about actually looking at intellig@@ ent har@@ m @-@ reduction strateg@@ ies .
we know the connec@@ tions between drug use and H@@ I@@ V .
if we ignor@@ e those in this House , then there will be further har@@ m , further crime and further suffering .
we want to la@@ y much greater stress on har@@ m reduction , but also on re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation .
we want to provide appropriate funding for information measures and not to pre@@ ten@@ d that the public has sufficient information about this problem .
we also want to take appropriate steps to prevent the prof@@ its of illegal drug @-@ trafficking from being used to fund everything from international terrorism to other forms of crime .
this report is thus not &apos; hard &apos; or &apos; so@@ ft &apos; .
it is effective .
it tac@@ kl@@ es crime , as well as the har@@ m being done to individuals .
in this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs enter@@ ing pris@@ ons .
Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia continu@@ ally stres@@ sed this point , because it is too often ig@@ no@@ red in Member States .
it is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issues across Member States which sometimes individual Member States are not emphas@@ ising enough .
pris@@ ons are now multi@@ pl@@ ying the effects of drug har@@ m .
people are coming out of pris@@ ons and commit@@ ting more crime .
this is a serious issue for the European Union .
there is a strong public app@@ et@@ ite for us as MEPs and for the Commission to tackle drugs with an effective drugs strategy .
the old sty@@ le of cl@@ ic@@ h@@ é@@ s and information about drugs has long gone .
we now need a more effective strategy .
this report places the right emphasis on har@@ m reduction , tac@@ kl@@ ing add@@ ic@@ tion and dealing with the source of drug problems , rather than ex@@ p@@ oun@@ ding cl@@ ic@@ h@@ é@@ s about the effects .
it is a good report which we will support .
it has been much amended and I think that , in the light of those amendments , it is a report that the whole House should support .
we on this side will do so .
. Mr President , if I could cut down the use of drugs by voting against this report , I would do so immediately , but that , unfortunately , is not an option .
I therefore call on this House to support this report , for it is an excellent and coura@@ ge@@ ous one .
what is its objective ?
I think we all share it .
I have also lis@@ tened to Mrs B@@ re@@ po@@ els , and we have supported a large propor@@ tion of her amendments .
the objective is har@@ m reduction , lim@@ iting the damage for the us@@ er and for the environment .
we must look into the best way of achieving this .
we must look to see which policy can produce results , because they are what matter .
this is not about ide@@ ology , but about results .
we must adopt policy that is based on fact , research and exchange of knowledge and experience , rather than on ide@@ ology .
it is therefore unfor@@ tun@@ ate that the assessment of the previous strategy was not available on time .
moreover , it was stated a moment ago that the Council would , in the next few days , be decid@@ ing to adopt this strategy after all .
it would be very regretta@@ ble if the Council were to do so without Parliament having had a say in it .
the report takes a p@@ ra@@ g@@ matic , realistic approach , and I have to say , in all hon@@ es@@ ty , that I have interpre@@ ted it in a completely different way from Mrs B@@ re@@ po@@ els .
I do not think at all that it rules out repres@@ sion as an option .
it is , of course , the case - and that also applies to Dutch policy , which is wid@@ ely mis@@ understood - that such repres@@ sion must be specific and effective .
looking at the tou@@ gh war on drugs w@@ aged by the USA , I would say that this has done nothing to reduce the use of drugs , but has only lined the po@@ c@@ ket@@ s of the drugs bar@@ ons .
crucial to our approach must be prevention and p@@ ra@@ g@@ mat@@ ism .
I will give you a few examples that are contro@@ versi@@ al , even in the Netherlands .
everyone has difficul@@ ty accep@@ ting them , and they are not decisions to be taken li@@ ghtly .
should we , for example , provide need@@ les to drug users who live on the stre@@ ets ?
are we , by doing this , cond@@ on@@ ing their use of drugs ?
no , of course not , but if we provide need@@ les , then we know for certain that there are no di@@ r@@ ty need@@ les in cir@@ cula@@ tion or in use .
at major house parties , where young people take all kin@@ ds of tab@@ l@@ ets , including ec@@ sta@@ s@@ y and that sort of thing , should we test the quality of those tab@@ l@@ ets ?
should we provide information ?
should we ensure that those young people do not mi@@ x al@@ co@@ ho@@ l with drugs ?
by doing this , do you give them the message that it is o@@ ka@@ y to use drugs ?
that is a risk .
on the other hand , I can see that , if this is not done , then young people di@@ e at these parties .
as long as they still use drugs , which they do , I think that prevention and information are important .
finally , we have tabled two amendments about the ex@@ changing of information and consideration of alternative methods .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , across the world prohi@@ b@@ iti@@ on@@ ism has always produced two results : on the one hand , a large increase in the number of de@@ a@@ ths and imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ments among those who use n@@ ar@@ co@@ tics , who constitute the sec@@ tion of the pris@@ on population with the highest re @-@ off@@ ending rate , and on the other hand un@@ limited big business for all sor@@ ts of drug traffic@@ kers .
this plan , however , foc@@ uses mainly on protecting everyone &apos;s health .
this is why the har@@ m reduction strateg@@ ies are absolutely fundamental .
only by keeping ali@@ ve persons who currently cannot or do not want to stop using n@@ ar@@ co@@ tic substances can we hope that in the future they will succeed in es@@ cap@@ ing from all forms of depend@@ ence .
we must not forget that most de@@ a@@ ths are due to A@@ ID@@ S and heart fail@@ u@@ res , that is , pa@@ th@@ ological situations connec@@ ted with drug @-@ taking methods .
for this reason , har@@ m reduction involves taking action on the stre@@ et and at low @-@ th@@ res@@ hold c@@ ent@@ res .
in addition , we must firmly dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish between drug deal@@ ers and drug users , although repres@@ sive policies ten@@ d to place them in the same categ@@ ory .
finally , it is essential to integra@@ te social measures and p@@ har@@ ma@@ c@@ ological sub@@ stitu@@ tion measures .
we must avoid any kind of mor@@ alis@@ tic attitude that s@@ ets these in opposition .
. Mr President , we are today discussing Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s contro@@ versi@@ al report on the European anti @-@ drug strategy , central to which is the fight against drugs rather than the promotion of them .
jud@@ ging by the t@@ it@@ le of the report , we seem to be in agreement on this .
there is no place for drugs in a heal@@ thy society .
if we in the European Union are serious about tac@@ kl@@ ing the drug trade , we will need to impose sanctions .
we can no longer toler@@ ate the people who ru@@ in lives by making money from add@@ ic@@ ts .
however , we might well have a running b@@ attle on our hands if , contr@@ ar@@ i@@ wise , we did not do everything in our power to fight drug use .
in addition to taking preven@@ tive measures , it must still be possible to pen@@ alise the use of drugs .
on behalf of my group , I have therefore tabled two amendments enab@@ ling the continued application of sanctions in respect of drug off@@ ences , al@@ ong@@ side preven@@ tive measures .
I urge you to support those amendments .
this , of course , does not make it a good report .
I have to get it off my ch@@ est : the report is full of ide@@ ology , despite the fact that it claim@@ s the opposite .
I will leave it here .
thank you for the opportunity of speaking my mind .
. Mr President , even though I will not be supporting the report I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
despite what he may say about the need to move away from ide@@ ology , there is an aw@@ ful lot of ide@@ ology within the report .
if we have differ@@ ing opinions , it will be hard for us to find the common ground that we should all s@@ tri@@ ve for .
I must say at the out@@ set that on reading the report one would believe that the crimin@@ alisation of drugs and drug use has led to an increase in the use of drugs .
one would therefore have to tac@@ it@@ ly agree that dec@@ r@@ imin@@ alisation would lead to a reduction in and the saf@@ er use of drugs .
the refer@@ ences to &apos; har@@ m reduction &apos; methods and so on are an abuse of the Eng@@ lis@@ h language .
it is merely facil@@ itation .
despite what people may say and despite the good inten@@ tions that they may have , it is incor@@ rec@@ t to say that the death rate from A@@ ID@@ S could be reduced through need@@ le exchange .
a us@@ er will always use more need@@ les and pass them on to other users .
we have to be realistic when we look at this problem .
the fact is , first and fore@@ most , that we are dealing with people &apos;s lives - and the lives of people who are in@@ vari@@ ably some of the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able in our society .
there are claim@@ s that we would make their drug use saf@@ er by suppl@@ ying sho@@ o@@ ting @-@ up k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens , by giving them cle@@ an need@@ les , or by the me@@ dical use of her@@ o@@ in - as stated in the report - and that this would make these people &apos;s lives better .
the reality is that add@@ ic@@ tion is hel@@ l , add@@ ic@@ tion destro@@ ys .
the only way to stop people from being add@@ ic@@ ts is by sto@@ pp@@ ing them from using drugs .
the only way to prevent people from rela@@ p@@ sing into add@@ ic@@ tion is to take away their need for the drug .
if you dis@@ believe what I say , do not b@@ other looking at any of the so @-@ called &apos; illegal drugs &apos; .
look at the legal drugs that are available in Europe - al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes - and see the damage that they cause .
Mr Mor@@ a@@ es spoke earlier about the de@@ vasta@@ tion that is caused on the stre@@ ets because of drug @-@ related crime .
look at the de@@ vasta@@ tion that is caused by al@@ co@@ ho@@ l - a legal drug - on the stre@@ ets of every c@@ ity in w@@ estern Europe .
if we go down the road of leg@@ alisation and har@@ m reduction , as proposed in this report , then we would see the problem exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated a hun@@ dre@@ d@@ f@@ old across all our c@@ ities .
the issue here is not about a mi@@ x @-@ and @-@ mat@@ ch of best policies .
the issue is about information to show people the damage and dang@@ ers that they face if they get involved in drugs .
the issue is about strong criminal penal@@ ties to ensure that those who traffic in drugs are h@@ it where it h@@ ur@@ ts : in their po@@ c@@ ket@@ s .
that requires ass@@ et se@@ iz@@ u@@ res and ass@@ et fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing ; a strong policy to ensure that those who are add@@ ic@@ ts and those who fall into drug problems are given proper resources to overcome their add@@ ic@@ tions .
as some@@ body who has worked with young ad@@ ul@@ ts who are drug add@@ ic@@ ts and al@@ co@@ hol@@ ics , I have seen that the only way that people get off drugs is when they stop .
that should be the ultima@@ te aim , not facilita@@ ting drug use .
Mr President , there are two genuinely oppos@@ ing views in this case : one in which drugs have been accepted as a natural part of our every@@ day life and another in which there is a desire to do everything to stop the s@@ ale and consumption of all drugs .
most Swed@@ es , especially par@@ ents , are in favour of the latter approach .
it means that prevention and the fight against drugs under criminal law have the highest priority .
to maintain , like Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia , that current drugs policy could be a crime against human rights is quite al@@ i@@ en to us .
we do not see the taking of illegal drugs as a human right .
penal@@ ties that enable drug add@@ ic@@ ts to choose care instead of pris@@ on are not a crime against human rights .
they are a way of helping people es@@ cap@@ e drug depend@@ ency .
the European Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ru@@ gs and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ dic@@ tion in Lisbon also points this out at the end of the introduc@@ tory sum@@ mar@@ y in its report , which I think Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia should read .
we do not wish to dec@@ r@@ imin@@ alise drug abuse .
instead , we wish to give clear and un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous sig@@ n@@ als that reject drugs .
proposals to have do@@ c@@ tors offer people help in taking drugs or , even worse , proposals to distribu@@ te her@@ o@@ in are just as al@@ i@@ en to us .
what is central as far as we are concerned is that the re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation of drug add@@ ic@@ ts and the content of the care given to them should be , and remain , a national competence .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , in common with we Swedish Mo@@ der@@ ates , will vote against Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s report precisely because we take a stand in the fight against this epidem@@ ic .
our approach is direc@@ ted towards rele@@ as@@ ing people from drug depend@@ ency , not seeing them ho@@ o@@ ked on drugs .
Mr President , in the si@@ x@@ ties , re@@ be@@ ll@@ ious and critical young people dis@@ covered the drugs that had pre@@ viously been used only behind closed do@@ ors by the well @-@ he@@ el@@ ed in society .
they saw the use of so@@ ft drugs as part of their fight for freedom .
since then , policy in a number of states has been aimed at is@@ ol@@ ating , crimin@@ alis@@ ing , pen@@ alis@@ ing and elimin@@ ating drug users .
this repres@@ sive approach has not preven@@ ted the use of drugs from s@@ pre@@ ading .
the alternative to this approach is not to become in@@ different and consequently to res@@ ign on@@ es@@ elf to the damage which drugs do to the health of the users and the nu@@ is@@ ance they cause for others , as also do al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and n@@ ic@@ o@@ tin@@ e .
we should not sh@@ y away from the conflict with the deal@@ ers , who make a good living from other people &apos;s problems .
in his report , my colleague , Mr G@@ i@@ us@@ to Ca@@ ta@@ nia , has shown the right way to reduce the problems as much as possible .
he endor@@ ses the practice , developed in the Netherlands , Belgi@@ um , S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land and parts of Germany , of toler@@ ance , prevention and provision of aid to users and of dist@@ ing@@ uis@@ hing between the add@@ ic@@ tive ten@@ den@@ cies of different types of drugs .
I am aware that this approach meet@@ s with em@@ o@@ tional objec@@ tions among those who la@@ b@@ ou@@ red under the ill@@ u@@ sion of being able to sta@@ m@@ p out drugs by pen@@ alis@@ ing the users , but that has only resul@@ ted in res@@ is@@ tance to the lack of freedom .
that is why broad support is needed for the alternative .
Mr President , the Swedish June Lis@@ t is strongly critical of the report we are deb@@ ating today .
according to the proposal , a genuine EU policy to combat drugs must be introduced .
a common drugs policy within the EU means a compromise policy that is liber@@ al regarding drugs .
in Sweden , any use of drugs , excep@@ t for me@@ dical reasons , is bann@@ ed .
for us , it is important for Sweden &apos;s restric@@ tive drugs policy to continue in the future too .
we recommen@@ d preven@@ tive work , treatment , social education and re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation .
the report emphas@@ ises a drugs policy designed to reduce har@@ m .
we want to work towards a drugs @-@ free society instead of accep@@ ting the use of drugs .
we ob@@ ject to drugs being classi@@ fied as so@@ ft or hard , as well as to the as@@ ser@@ tion that so @-@ called so@@ ft drugs are not add@@ ic@@ tive .
the lack of internal border controls able to prevent the drugs trade between the Member States is a problem in this connection .
an individual EU Member State must be able to monitor its national borders in order to prevent drugs from coming into the country .
as matters now stand , internal border controls in the EU are practic@@ ally non @-@ exis@@ tent .
in conclusion , I would note that drug problems in the EU are in large measure a consequ@@ ence of the pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing poverty in many countries in the world .
not being informed by a sense of solidarity , EU trade policy involving du@@ ties , lic@@ ences and quo@@ ta@@ s contribu@@ tes to the problems of global poverty .
it is important for the UN , rather than the EU , to work towards making it pro@@ fi@@ table to cul@@ ti@@ va@@ te alternative cro@@ ps in the poor countries of the world .
Mr President , Mr F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i , ladies and gentlemen , the report presented to us today by Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia calls into question the policy of z@@ ero toler@@ ance and prohi@@ b@@ ition implemented by the Member States .
the rapporteur &apos;s aim is to amen@@ d the current strategy and it will be to no one &apos;s surpris@@ e that we have voted against this report
Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia mentioned the report by the European drugs and drug add@@ ic@@ tion monitoring centre .
Mr Es@@ ti@@ even@@ ar@@ t was with us last month and pointed out that , and I quo@@ te , &apos; there are positive sig@@ ns that progress has been made in reducing some of the wor@@ st consequences of drug use . &quot;
he said that the number of drug @-@ related de@@ a@@ ths has be@@ gu@@ n to fall , that her@@ o@@ in use has le@@ ve@@ lled off in a number of countries , that the H@@ I@@ V epidem@@ ic among users is s@@ lo@@ wing and , I quo@@ te , &apos; measures to reduce drug @-@ related har@@ m are inten@@ si@@ fying and , across much of Europe , drug users have better access to treatment and care . &quot;
this clearly demonstra@@ tes that not everything has been negative .
much remains to be done and , despite all the policies that we have been pursu@@ ing , enormous problems still exist in terms of the production and trafficking of drugs , and in terms of drug use , which continues to h@@ it extremely high levels in all Member States .
in light of the accession of ten new Member States , it is essential that we step up cooperation with the countries that now border the EU .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is room for a European anti @-@ drugs policy that fi@@ ghts back against drug @-@ related crime , and that , as per the programme , meet@@ s the four main objectives of preventing drug use and depend@@ ency , reducing the supply and demand of illegal drugs , lim@@ iting social and health damage and reducing crime .
this is the path that we must follow - the path of combat , not the path of s@@ la@@ ck@@ ness .
Mr President , certain facts are stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward , such as the fact that Europe is the world &apos;s larg@@ est market for c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is .
is it possible to get rid of drugs ?
shall we give up and just limit the damage ?
empha@@ tically not .
we know that it is specifically with c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is that most people who end up m@@ is @-@ using her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and am@@ p@@ he@@ ta@@ min@@ es begin .
that is why it is crucial for us to ensure that fe@@ wer new c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is users are rec@@ ru@@ ited .
according to Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s report , the restric@@ tive policy has failed .
the figures from the European Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ru@@ gs and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ dic@@ tion in Lisbon , which was published a cou@@ ple of weeks ago , is un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous .
in countries such as Sweden , with a restric@@ tive view of drugs , 7 % of 15 year @-@ ol@@ ds have used c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is .
in Gre@@ at Bri@@ tain , 4@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 % of all 15 year @-@ old bo@@ ys have used c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is .
the restric@@ tive policy has led to dra@@ matic reduc@@ tions specifically in the number of drug users rec@@ ru@@ ited .
according to Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia , &apos; so@@ ft &quot; drugs are not dangerous .
according to the Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre &apos;s new data , there is an increased risk of a range of p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal and mental problems such as de@@ pression , p@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ es and sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
a review of European drugs policy is under way right now .
in countries such as the Netherlands , too , the attitude has changed over the last ten years .
now , only a third of the country &apos;s so @-@ called co@@ ff@@ ee sh@@ op@@ s remain .
the Dutch Justice Minister has said that the Netherlands will probably be forced to al@@ ter its policy .
there are high hop@@ es of re@@ ver@@ sing the tr@@ end .
anyone who wants to see fe@@ wer drugs in Europe should vote against Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s report .
Mr President , I would war@@ n against the terms &apos; so@@ ft &quot; and &apos; hard &quot; drugs .
talk of so@@ ft drugs gives out completely the wrong sig@@ n@@ als .
it makes these drugs out to be har@@ m@@ less , but there are no so@@ ft drugs .
instead , these drugs - for example , c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is - are often the ga@@ te@@ way to other drugs .
I have visi@@ ted many different treatment c@@ ent@@ res for drug add@@ ic@@ ts where just about all add@@ ic@@ ts have agreed that what are mis@@ ta@@ ken@@ ly called so@@ ft drugs started them off on the drug mis@@ use that destro@@ yed their lives and ro@@ b@@ bed them of their future .
these add@@ ic@@ ts feel ang@@ ry and f@@ r@@ ustra@@ ted that society has not made the dang@@ ers of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , has@@ h@@ ish and similar drugs suffici@@ ently clear .
in my own country , Sweden , we have comb@@ ined a restric@@ tive drugs policy and the crimin@@ alisation of drugs with care and treatment for add@@ ic@@ ts .
this comb@@ ination has proved to be the best way of sto@@ pp@@ ing drug abuse .
the small increase we have seen in Sweden in recent years has been due par@@ tly to the open borders and par@@ tly to the influence of the leg@@ alisation debate taking place elsewhere in the EU .
thank you very much .
that conclu@@ des the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor , so the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day at 12 noon .
I should like to give the floor to Mr S@@ tur@@ dy , the rapporteur .
Mr President , may I begin by saying what a ple@@ asure it is to be here , and I hope that tomorrow when the vote is taken we will have an agreement .
I see Mr J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen is here , and I want to pass some comments about the way this Parliament has worked .
Mr J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen came in very late on , because he is a new Member .
my Liberal , Soci@@ alist and Green colleagues have worked very closely together on this report .
I thank them , because it left me in a position of great streng@@ th when it came to negotiating with the Council , and that is a position all of us in this au@@ g@@ ust House aim for in order to be able to put our points forward .
what is this report about ?
the idea was to put in place a central harmon@@ ised system for the control of certain types of chem@@ ic@@ als and fi@@ x levels of M@@ R@@ L@@ s - maximum resid@@ ue levels - of chem@@ ic@@ als in fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ff@@ s .
the one thing that has not es@@ cap@@ ed me , but may well have es@@ cap@@ ed other Members , is that this is a for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the R@@ E@@ AC@@ H Directive , which will be one of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est reports to come through Parliament .
if they can han@@ dle it in the way that we hand@@ led it - I say &apos; we &apos; because all our colleagues , as I said earlier , worked together - then we shall be in an extremely strong position .
what does it mean to consumers , the people who will be affected by this legislation ?
it means saf@@ er food across Europe ; it means that if you bu@@ y a tom@@ a@@ to in Ireland that has come from Spain you can guarantee the quality and safety of that product .
it provides a guarantee that British la@@ m@@ b sol@@ d - d@@ are I say - to the French is safe .
that is extremely important for the consumer .
we have included a number of recommendations where , for instance , food is tes@@ ted at the point of s@@ ale , which we have all agreed on .
however , we also agreed that impor@@ ts need to be of the same level of quality .
this is important for people who im@@ port into the European Union .
the levels of pes@@ tic@@ ides have to be of the same standard - not that they necess@@ arily were or were not ; but it is important that we get that message across for people who come into the European Union .
I shall mention briefly some things we f@@ ought over and had great debates about .
good agricultural practices - G@@ A@@ P - was a difficult issue , but we got a definition with the help of the Commission , which I am delighted to see here today .
our colleagues worked closely with the Commission and , as I said , the Council .
this is very important in setting a preced@@ ent for the future , so that we know exactly what good agricultural practices are .
it was somewhat difficult to get a position on sy@@ ner@@ g@@ is@@ tic effects , but we now have a situation where we know exactly where we are going to be with those effects .
for those who do not know , sy@@ ner@@ g@@ is@@ tic effects are a mi@@ x@@ ture of chem@@ ic@@ als pos@@ sibly used on a cro@@ p , and there is no particular definition of how they are trac@@ e@@ able .
we have put in place legislation which will work in the future .
it has left a position open for future Member States to be able to define exactly what the situation is on sy@@ ner@@ g@@ is@@ tic effects .
I am concerned about how governments will implement this - because it is a regulation and therefore has to be implemented .
I read recently in a paper that governments ten@@ d to g@@ old @-@ pla@@ te things .
it is important , when we are pus@@ hing this through , that governments do not g@@ old @-@ pla@@ te it : we want an equal fo@@ o@@ ting .
it is interesting that the British Minister of Agriculture , Mrs B@@ ec@@ ket@@ t , has said that she will decide when farmers can go into the field , or when it is too w@@ et or has been ra@@ ining .
I wonder exactly how she is going to do that .
nevertheless , it is important that we do not place governments or countries at a dis@@ advantage compared to other Member States .
that is why this legislation has been put in place .
it is wor@@ ka@@ ble , it is a good regulation .
just in case the joint resolutions we have agreed do not go through , the PPE @-@ DE Group has covered itself ; but I expect all the joint amendments to be adopted tomorrow .
I look forward to seeing Member States implementing and working well with it .
. Mr President , honourable Members , I am pleased that it appears that the draft regulation on pes@@ tic@@ ide resid@@ ues in food and feed can be adopted at second reading .
the negotiations between Council presidency , the European Parliament rapporteurs and the Commission have recently ga@@ ined mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m and last week the final obstacles were cle@@ ared .
allow me to under@@ line the signific@@ ance of these regulations for food safety .
it will enable us to set harmon@@ ised maximum resid@@ ue levels in the EU for all pes@@ tic@@ ides and all agricultural products in one pi@@ ece of legislation directly applic@@ able to all EU citizens .
all situations will be covered , including a list of pes@@ tic@@ ides for which no maximum resid@@ ue levels are required and the low level that will apply syste@@ ma@@ tically to all pes@@ tic@@ ides for which we have no information .
there will be clar@@ ity about how and to whom an M@@ R@@ L application should be made , and on the procedure to be followed .
the European Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety Authority will carry out the risk assessment for consumers with the best available meth@@ od@@ ology .
control and en@@ for@@ cement by the Member States will be reinfor@@ ced and improved .
coordination of monitoring by the Commission will have a more obli@@ g@@ atory nature .
this legislation will benefit all parties .
consumers will prof@@ it from better protection and more transparency about which pes@@ tic@@ ides could be present in food and their potential effects .
food producers will benefit because there will be more clar@@ ity as to what specific@@ ations the products have to comply with .
control and en@@ for@@ cement bodies will be able to refer to one single Community list of maximum resid@@ ue levels .
Member State legisla@@ tors will no longer need to trans@@ pose the provisions into national legislation .
before I fin@@ ish , I would like to make a few comments on the fin@@ er points resolved in the negotiations .
the European Parliament &apos;s ins@@ is@@ tence on taking cu@@ mula@@ tive and sy@@ ner@@ g@@ is@@ tic effects into account may lead to a bre@@ ak@@ through in the development and application of the necessary meth@@ od@@ ology .
I am pleased that this is now expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly mentioned in the draft legislation .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s determination to make an expl@@ ic@@ it link between the setting of maximum resid@@ ue levels and good agricultural practice , integrated p@@ est management and the use of the low@@ est amounts of pes@@ tic@@ ides necessary .
the clear requirement to take into account v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able groups of the population , including children and un@@ bor@@ n children , is also a useful step forward .
these issues make a positive contribution to this regulation .
the final phase of the negotiations saw an increasing mutual trust among the parties .
I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromise package worked out between the three institutions .
I trust that you will confirm Parliament &apos;s accep@@ tance at the vote tomorrow .
we are now appro@@ ac@@ hing the conclusion of this project .
it is time to acknowledge the efforts of all parties and in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr S@@ tur@@ dy , for his hand@@ ling of this d@@ os@@ si@@ er and for the time and effort he has put into his report .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we are aim@@ ing at includes less bureauc@@ racy and greater si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity ; this single Regulation is meant to re@@ place four basic directives on pes@@ tic@@ ide resid@@ ues .
this is not just about food safety and health , but also about equal opportunities in compet@@ ing in the internal market and - let us not forget - on the global market .
producers and proc@@ ess@@ ors must operate under id@@ en@@ tical conditions , and all consumers are entitled to safe food .
the European Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned .
it is no use whatever to consumers to get , week in and week out , one new war@@ ning after another , sometimes pe@@ tering out into such gener@@ alis@@ ations as the statement that , for example , appl@@ es from a particular Member State are exc@@ eed@@ ing the maximum per@@ mitted levels , when such announ@@ c@@ ements are help@@ ful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive resid@@ ues of pes@@ tic@@ ides .
we are setting very high standards right across the EU , particularly where health is concerned , and quite rightly too .
equally , though , we have to look more closely at impor@@ ts into the European Union .
there is no room for double standards here , and what that means - as I see it - is ti@@ gh@@ ter controls on impor@@ ted goods .
we cannot interven@@ e in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here , and that makes it all the more important that the end market be chec@@ ked and mon@@ ito@@ red .
I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of &apos; good agricultural practice . &quot;
Europe &apos;s farmers produce in accordance with the most str@@ ing@@ ent legal requirements , as is best known in the case of the rules on cross @-@ compliance .
those who f@@ arm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health ha@@ z@@ ard .
I am grateful to Mr S@@ tur@@ dy for the work he has done over many months , and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr S@@ tur@@ dy .
I think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceed@@ ed in a ple@@ as@@ ant and open at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here .
I should like to thank the other &apos; sha@@ dow rapporteurs , &quot; and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guid@@ ance and advice we have received .
I am pleased that I have been allowed to del@@ iv@@ er my first speech here in plenary on a matter as important as this .
in actual fact , I see this draft A@@ c@@ t or legislation as an example of the EU at its best .
we shall secure a number of things with this draft A@@ c@@ t if it is adopted in the form in which we should like to have it adopted .
firstly , cross @-@ border trade is of course en@@ su@@ red .
a vari@@ ety of fo@@ ods is guaranteed , as is their presence on the sh@@ el@@ ves at lower prices .
other , still more important , things are , however , also en@@ su@@ red , namely consumers &quot; health , safety and security in connection with the fo@@ ods they bu@@ y .
I come from a very c@@ old country up in the nor@@ th , so I am pleased to be able to bu@@ y fru@@ it and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les in the w@@ in@@ ter too .
I am only pleased , however , if I can be sure that the ap@@ ple I e@@ at is also heal@@ thy , and this is something that this legislation can help ensure .
I shall mention a cou@@ ple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see success@@ fully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromis@@ es with which everyone can be satisfied .
firstly , I want to mention the consideration given to especially v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able groups .
it is one thing to de@@ vis@@ e legislation with a view to ro@@ b@@ ust , heal@@ thy and vi@@ goro@@ us men such as Mr S@@ tur@@ dy and myself .
that is fine , of course .
there also needs , however , to be legislation with a view to more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able groups such as children , bor@@ n and as yet un@@ bor@@ n .
that too is something , I am pleased to say , that we have ob@@ tained .
another thing I would emphasise - and I would now a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise to the interpre@@ ters for they are about to be conf@@ ron@@ ted by difficult expres@@ sions again - is that we have incorpor@@ ated cu@@ mula@@ tive effects that are the result of sy@@ nergy .
that is extremely important .
it s@@ oun@@ ds a little technical , but in reality it is quite simple .
the fact is , it is not enough only to take account of how pois@@ on@@ ous or non @-@ pois@@ on@@ ous a pes@@ tic@@ ide is .
we must also take account of how pois@@ on@@ ous or non @-@ pois@@ on@@ ous two or three or four pes@@ tic@@ ides are when they inte@@ rac@@ t , that is to say when they re@@ act to each other in a particular food .
that is something it is inc@@ redi@@ bly important to take account of .
it is an area about which we do not know much at present , but one about which we need to know more in the future and of which we must take more account .
otherwise , there may be major consequences in terms of health .
I fear that that is already now the case .
my third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation , but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions .
I think that na@@ ming and sha@@ ming is a sensible idea .
I think it is sensible of us now to obli@@ ge the Member States to publis@@ h their control results on the Internet .
it also brings about op@@ enn@@ ess , which in turn produc@@ es security .
the consumer must have peace of mind , and that is something we are in this way guarante@@ eing .
four@@ th@@ ly and finally , I think it encouraging that we have ob@@ tained some clear and constructive defin@@ itions , including defin@@ itions of good agricultural practice and an actual definition of maximum limit values .
these were not easy things to negoti@@ ate success@@ fully but , especially through sound guid@@ ance from the Council and the Commission , we ob@@ tained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives .
I would say that , all in all , this is a proposal that may make a positive difference to the every@@ day life of Europeans , and that is something I am pleased about and pro@@ ud to be associated with .
Mr President , the draft law we are deb@@ ating in this House today will be of great signific@@ ance for public health in Europe and for Europeans &quot; confidence in food safety .
it is inc@@ redi@@ bly important for all our vo@@ ters in our various constitu@@ encies , but it is particularly important perhaps for par@@ ents with all@@ er@@ gic children .
our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the A@@ lli@@ ance of Liber@@ als and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection .
I should like to emphasise a few things .
the internal market is inc@@ redi@@ bly important .
in this internal market , we wish to protect our citizens and , at the same time , set standards for tes@@ ting and tre@@ ating food at those lin@@ ks in the cha@@ in where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first en@@ ters the distribution cha@@ in .
in this respect , this proposal is sound .
it is also sound in@@ as@@ much as it protec@@ ts important and v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able high @-@ risk groups such as women , inf@@ ants and un@@ bor@@ n children .
we are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice .
in this , we have taken account both of integrated p@@ est control and of climate vari@@ ations in order to bring about a fa@@ ire@@ r proposal .
it is inc@@ redi@@ bly important that these options for taking account of local or regional vari@@ ations should not reduce the proposal &apos;s level of amb@@ ition .
this is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal , once it has properly ente@@ red into force .
it is good that there have been improvements to the Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety Authority in terms of both time and resources .
I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job .
I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non @-@ governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and hand@@ ling of these issues .
Mr President , it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue .
it is a p@@ ity that once again in this Parliament legislation is left until the end of the day .
in a recent opinion pol@@ l 7@@ 7 per cent of British people said that they are concerned about pes@@ tic@@ ides in food so , as everyone has said , what we are doing here res@@ on@@ ates with public opinion .
I am very pleased that we have a compromise and that we agree on the main things .
there are two issues which particularly concern me and I am very pleased that we have secu@@ red a deal on them .
the first is cu@@ mula@@ tive and sy@@ ner@@ g@@ is@@ tic effects : co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il effects .
we were told that there is no meth@@ od@@ ology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research sugges@@ ts is at the ro@@ ot of our problems .
I am very pleased to hear the Commissioner say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making sure that we get more research into the cu@@ mula@@ tive effects .
that is why I tabled the amendment to reci@@ tal 5 .
one problem is that a lot of experts say that these cu@@ mula@@ tive effects are un@@ foun@@ ded , but we have nothing to prove or dis@@ prove this .
we must get this research , it is very important .
the second issue mentioned by Mr J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen is about the effects on children and the un@@ bor@@ n .
a lot of research sugges@@ ts that children and the un@@ bor@@ n have in some way been affected by either pes@@ tic@@ ides or chem@@ ic@@ als in our environment .
in a recent ra@@ di@@ o programme about chem@@ ic@@ als they did a series of tes@@ ts on a gran@@ d@@ mo@@ ther , a mo@@ ther , and a gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter .
these tes@@ ts show@@ ed that the highest level of chem@@ ic@@ als was found not in the gran@@ d@@ mo@@ ther - who had li@@ ved through the highest levels of pollution in our stre@@ ets in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s , 19@@ 4@@ 0@@ s and 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s - but in the gran@@ d@@ da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter who was 15 years old .
they found in her blood chem@@ ic@@ als that had been taken off our sh@@ el@@ ves many years be@@ fore@@ hand .
we know that some of these substances come in through pes@@ tic@@ ides .
it is extremely important that we start looking not just at tes@@ ting on ad@@ ul@@ ts but at tes@@ ting on children and looking at the effects on bab@@ ies in the w@@ om@@ b .
public confidence in food safety and food standards is very low .
in the sur@@ ve@@ y that I referred to earlier , over 50 % of British people said they did not believe that government reas@@ sur@@ an@@ ces about pes@@ tic@@ ides were acc@@ ura@@ te .
consequently we need to get it right .
scientific research shows that impor@@ ted products have more pes@@ tic@@ ides than products gro@@ wn within the EU .
this is extremely important legislation .
I am very grateful to Mr S@@ tur@@ dy , Mr J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen and all those within the Commission and the Council who worked very hard to achieve a compromise that we can all support tomorrow .
thank you very much .
that conclu@@ des the list of speakers .
I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor , so the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day at 12 noon .
the next item is the Commission and Council statements on the prepar@@ ation of the European Council ( 17 December 2004 ) .
. Mr President , the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the first for the new Commission .
it will be an important meeting , mar@@ king the next steps in the process of building a larg@@ er , more prosper@@ ous and saf@@ er European Union .
it will be a sign of our amb@@ ition for a Union which is dyna@@ mic and on the move ; a Union ready to share its des@@ tin@@ y with the European family ; a Union which is concerned about the security of its citizens .
I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation .
how else can we gener@@ ate the trust in Europe &apos;s institutions and politicians that is needed for a smo@@ o@@ th ratification of the Constitution ?
we have heard from the presidency about its expectations and the issues that the summit will address .
let me comment briefly on three issues : enlargement , the fight against terrorism and the financial perspec@@ tives .
firstly , our policy of enlargement of the Union has been the key in fre@@ eing us from our c@@ old war past .
the gra@@ vi@@ ta@@ tional pul@@ l of the pros@@ pect of EU membership has trans@@ formed and modern@@ ised several post @-@ commun@@ ist soci@@ eties .
it has thus res@@ hap@@ ed the European order .
this was and remains an achiev@@ ement of historic propor@@ tions that we should not under@@ estima@@ te .
your House has been instru@@ mental in supporting this process , but our enlargement is still in@@ complete .
this European Council will take the next steps for four countries , offer@@ ing them the potential - through enlargement - to join the European ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am .
last October the Commission made it clear that it should be possible to conclude the accession negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia and Romania in 2004 .
indeed , this negotiating process was closed yesterday , thanks to the increased efforts by the European Union and by these two countries .
I congratulate the Netherlands presidency for its excellent work and close cooperation with the Commission on that particular subject .
the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty for both countries now needs to be fin@@ alised and we hope that it can be signed after receiv@@ ing the ass@@ ent of this House during the s@@ pring of next year .
in the remain@@ ing period up to accession , the Commission will be w@@ at@@ ching closely to see that both countries del@@ iv@@ er on the commitments made during the negotiations , and in some cases this will mean a further acc@@ el@@ er@@ ation in their efforts .
at the request of the European Council , on 6 October the Commission adopted its report on Turkey and a clear recommendation .
the main message in the Commission &apos;s assessment is that Turkey has suffici@@ ently fulfi@@ lled the Copenhagen political criteria and that accession negotiations should now be open@@ ed .
we consider this recommendation , which was very carefully prepared , to be well balanced and a good basis for a decision by the Council .
I am looking forward to taking com@@ for@@ t from the position your House will take on this question later today .
Turkey has made further progress in the last weeks .
it has adopted five of the six pi@@ ec@@ es of legislation sig@@ n@@ all@@ ed by the Commission in its report ; the si@@ x@@ th law , on the execu@@ tion of sen@@ tences , is pen@@ ding before the Turkish Parliament .
it is now time for the European Council to hon@@ our its commitment to Turkey and announ@@ ce the opening of accession negotiations .
a clear date should be indicated .
we consider that , apart from the matters I have just mentioned , no other conditions ought to be added .
the European Council will no doubt wish to rec@@ all that political reforms will have to continue in the course of the negotiations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress closely .
we should also ask our Turkish friends in all hon@@ es@@ ty : if you want to become a member of a c@@ lu@@ b , is it not normal that you recognise the other members of the c@@ lu@@ b ?
I am convinced that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process , and prefer@@ ably so@@ on@@ er than later .
the objective of starting negotiations cannot be other than accession but we accept that the accession process is open @-@ en@@ ded and its outcome cannot be guaranteed be@@ fore@@ hand .
as in the past , trans@@ itional arrangements and certain specific safegu@@ ards may need to be considered .
but let me state what our ultima@@ te challenge will be : in the end , we need not only to overcome diplom@@ atic obstacles , but also to con@@ qu@@ er the hear@@ ts and min@@ ds of European citizens on this issue .
C@@ roati@@ a represents the first of the W@@ estern Bal@@ kan nations preparing to start the process for accession to the Union .
the Commission is ready to support the laun@@ ch of such negotiations , but believes that any progress should be cond@@ itional on increased cooperation between the C@@ roati@@ an Government and the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al for the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via .
if such cooperation is confirmed , then negotiations can be started in 2005 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with your per@@ mission I should like to turn to one of the twenty @-@ first century &apos;s key challenges , and one which we will also discuss at this week &apos;s Council summit , namely the threat of international terrorism .
what we are dealing with here is the u@@ g@@ ly face of globalisation .
international terrorism explo@@ its the advantages of pl@@ ur@@ alist soci@@ eties to attack the very foun@@ dations of those soci@@ eties - our freedoms .
I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agreements on how terrorism can be f@@ ought .
we must show our un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ing determination , but we must never lose si@@ ght of the democratic and legal principles which are at the very basis of our society and our prosperity .
the European Commission has played an active role in promoting and preparing an up@@ da@@ ted EU action plan on the fight against international terrorism , and I should like to make absolutely clear what we hope the outcome of the decisions to be taken at the end of the week will be .
these decisions must help us to ensure that the EU will be better prepared to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks , as well as allowing us to blo@@ ck the sources of funding for terrorists to a greater extent than pre@@ viously , improving our ability to manage the after@@ ma@@ th of an attack and , finally , ensuring better protection for our key infrastruc@@ tures .
we should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force .
we should also op@@ pose its per@@ ver@@ se lo@@ gic , by tac@@ kl@@ ing the ide@@ ological and social factors which lead individuals to com@@ mit such acts .
long @-@ term commitment and a clear political determination will be necessary to overcome this s@@ cour@@ ge .
the discussions at the summit will also take sto@@ ck of the situation regarding the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
I still believe that the Commission &apos;s proposals are sound , based as they are on a broad political consensus on what the EU must do .
the truth is that the political project on which the Commission &apos;s proposals are based was not actually at risk .
the Commission &apos;s proposals therefore constitute a val@@ id working basis .
the current c@@ eil@@ ing for own resources remains in place despite new requests to the EU due to the enlargement and to the development of new policies .
they are therefore reasonable proposals .
what we want to offer , however , is actual added European value , on top of what is offer@@ ed at national level .
of course , we must ensure dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine in the budgetary process , but this cannot be achieved by setting ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary limits , without reference to what the budget aims to achieve .
I am aware that some Member States remain convinced that the EU budget should be limited to 1 % of gro@@ s@@ s national re@@ ven@@ ue .
I do not believe that the EU &apos;s policy objectives are compatible with such a fig@@ ure .
are we prepared to ab@@ and@@ on the challenges of social and economic cohesion , which are all the more pres@@ sing after enlargement ?
are we really being serious as regards the policy of inves@@ ting in the major tr@@ ans @-@ European transport networks ?
are we really being serious as regards the need to fos@@ ter the European research policy ?
how can we ensure a European contribution towards combating terrorism and towards safe@@ guar@@ ding our citizens &quot; security ?
let me state this to you clearly : we cannot have more Europe with less money and a union ce@@ ases to be a union if the objective of cohesion is for@@ go@@ t@@ ten .
a 1 % limit would force us to cut back on our political objectives and would force us to re @-@ ass@@ ess commitments already made .
the Commission &apos;s position is therefore clear : our starting point is the package submitted in February of last year .
in s@@ pite of the Dutch Presidency &apos;s very hard work , the negotiations have , thus far , yet to really begin .
I sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will be able to dri@@ ve this process forward and ensure that effective negotiations go ahead , because it is important that we respect the timetable established in the Council &apos;s multi@@ annual strategic programme .
we must ensure that the programmes are fully up and running by 1 January 2007 .
this means that we must reach a political agreement in June of next year .
there is one thing I can promis@@ e : as always , the Commission will not be the stu@@ mb@@ ling blo@@ ck to the outcome of negotiations .
we shall help the Member States to reach agreements , but not at any price .
in the short time between the confir@@ mation of the new Commission and the forthcoming European Council , we will have seen important developments both inter@@ nation@@ ally - in particular in Ukraine - and for the Union .
with the decisions on enlargement and security that the European Council will take this week , we are show@@ ing in practical ways our confidence in the future of our continent .
we are show@@ ing how we can succeed in pro@@ jec@@ ting the values that we hold de@@ ar into the international ar@@ ena and exten@@ ding the ring of prosperity , solidarity and security further across our continent and the world .
. - Mr President , as with all European Coun@@ c@@ ils , the next one has some very interesting to@@ pic@@ s to discuss .
I would go further and say that they are not just interesting ; they are perhaps crucial to our Union &apos;s collective future .
consequently , not only will the Heads of State or Government be taking part , but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission .
at this time , we must ask for three in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble qu@@ alities : amb@@ ition , adequate resources and practical ideas .
let us look at what this means with regard to each of those to@@ pic@@ s .
whilst the process of ad@@ mit@@ ting Bulgar@@ ia and Romania appears to be going well and the result of genuine efforts on the part of the two countries , we are strongly aware , however , that Romania needs to s@@ prin@@ t down the home stra@@ ight .
whilst we too have no doub@@ ts about C@@ roati@@ a - you only need to have been to Z@@ agre@@ b or D@@ ub@@ ro@@ v@@ ni@@ k to appreciate how emb@@ ed@@ ded it is in European culture - Turkey is a special case , not only due to its ge@@ ograph@@ y , but also due to its pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar cultural and economic character@@ is@@ tics .
the case of Cyprus must not be s@@ w@@ ep@@ t under the car@@ p@@ et while we discuss negotiations .
nevertheless , the opening of negotiations will un@@ doub@@ tedly help to clarify for both sides many areas that are currently in doubt and it will even@@ tually be possible to g@@ au@@ ge more clearly what kind of Union would be prefer@@ able to both sides .
after all , there are other types of union apart from mar@@ ri@@ age that could poten@@ ti@@ ally be considered .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , terrorism is certainly one of the Council &apos;s most important por@@ t@@ f@@ ol@@ io@@ s and we must combat it glob@@ ally and un@@ s@@ tin@@ t@@ ingly .
ro@@ gue states that har@@ bour international terrorism , with var@@ ying degre@@ es of leg@@ ality , must be san@@ c@@ tioned by the EU without delay .
international cooperation at various levels - political , financial or operational - must also take place without delay .
in this area , there must be no delay and no lack of resources .
this brings me to the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives , a por@@ t@@ f@@ oli@@ o that , as far as we are concerned , will set the t@@ one for Europe &apos;s desire to deep@@ en our Union .
the resources must mat@@ ch the amb@@ ition .
this is something that J@@ acqu@@ es Del@@ ors said , and with good reason .
it is not possible , moreover , to che@@ at the countries that recently join@@ ed our European Union , nor those looking h@@ ope@@ fully to the EU as an eng@@ ine to pro@@ pe@@ l democracy and development forward in their countries .
let us be clear .
to think that Europe , the new Europe , our Europe , can be buil@@ t with the resources of the past is a fal@@ la@@ cy and it is worth saying that if amb@@ ition and solidarity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the ori@@ enta@@ tions and guidelines that are adopted , we should be as@@ ha@@ med of our current leaders .
Mr President , this brings me to external affairs .
the Council services tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East , Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan , the Mediterranean Par@@ t@@ nership and , I should add , probably the situation in Ukraine , D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r , relations with China and Russia and even T@@ ran@@ sa@@ tlan@@ tic relations .
what I am won@@ der@@ ing is that with an agenda of which I have only mentioned a few to@@ pic@@ s , with the desire for a joint , EU @-@ level external service , what resources will we use to seek to influence the international sc@@ ene ?
will we continue to be a so@@ ft power , s@@ tri@@ ving for multila@@ ter@@ alism without being in any way active on the international sc@@ ene ? or will we have at our dispos@@ al the resources - the appropriate resources - to finally stop being the political d@@ war@@ f of the international sc@@ ene ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall conclude by saying what I said at the beginning .
it is crucial that we speak about the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy , about combating drugs or A@@ ID@@ S , about the new neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy and about sustainable development .
if , however , we do not have the three elements of amb@@ ition , adequate resources and practical ideas , we will be speaking as though we were au@@ tis@@ tic .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should very much like to have been present at a meeting of the Portuguese Social Democrats .
the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , has frequ@@ ently told us of his &apos; b@@ lin@@ d da@@ tes , &quot; which have at@@ trac@@ ted the particular interest of this House .
this morning I have now heard from Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o that he pre@@ f@@ ers forms of co@@ ha@@ b@@ itation other than mar@@ ri@@ age .
interesting things are going on in Portugal .
in this instance , Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o , we are no advo@@ ca@@ tes of the common law mar@@ ri@@ age the EU is to enter into with Turkey .
we wish relations between the EU and Turkey to be strong , res@@ ili@@ ent , and stable - in good Christian Democ@@ rat sty@@ le .
I would also war@@ n you against speaking of cultural differences , Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o .
this community of values is open to everyone who shar@@ es these values , without any kind of cultural rela@@ ti@@ vity , and this is a point I should like to reiterate once again .
this is self @-@ ev@@ ident to our group , and , yesterday , we decided with what I think was almost 9@@ 9 % of votes within our group ...
in an open b@@ all@@ ot , not a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot , to give Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings our support for his beli@@ ef that , if this order of values can be en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in a Mus@@ li@@ m society , it will be pro@@ of that this order of values is open to every person , of whatever religi@@ on , s@@ kin c@@ ol@@ our and cultural or eth@@ nic back@@ ground they may be .
the reason why this is such an important issue , Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o , is that the fight against terrorism is also a subject for discussion at the European Council summit and during the pre@@ l@@ imin@@ ary debates .
I believe that there is a direct connection between this issue and the question of whether we will manage to dis@@ prove the the@@ ory that the Isla@@ m of the most dangerous terrorists currently active , the Isla@@ mic fundamentalis@@ ts , which they descri@@ be as the only Isla@@ m , and the order of values I referred to a moment ago are mu@@ tually exclu@@ sive .
I believe that the m@@ ere opening of negotiations with Turkey , a step which also means that Turkey is prepared to sub@@ mit to the Constitution and its rules , is evidence that the implementation of a sec@@ ular social reality is not linked in any way to religi@@ on , but instead to the political will of a people .
this is the crucial point , and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism .
I therefore believe that the debate on Turkey and the debate on the fight against terrorism are two sides of the same co@@ in .
during yesterday &apos;s prepar@@ ations for today &apos;s debate , we too discussed Romania and Bulgar@@ ia , and developments in both these countries .
I will not den@@ y that we regret that our fri@@ end , Mr N@@ as@@ ta@@ se , lost the presid@@ ential elections .
it was a fair decision , and we should like to congratulate Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u .
we only hope that Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u has a sufficient sense of responsibility , something which he did not demonstrate during the election campaign , not to enter into co@@ al@@ itions with parties in his country which are opposed to the European Union and which r@@ ide rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over our fundamental values .
you may be sure , Mr Wat@@ son , that we will continue to obser@@ ve Romania as closely as you have done to date , particularly with regard to the issue of whether the future Roman@@ ian President forms a co@@ al@@ ition with the extre@@ me right .
this is something you can depen@@ d on , and something we will obser@@ ve particularly closely .
we believe that the debate that is on the Council &apos;s agenda ...
should consolid@@ ate what the European Union has achieved in its role as medi@@ a@@ tor in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council .
on behalf of our group , I should like to say - and I also address these words to the Dutch Presidency - that the European Union has provided an enormous amount of support throughout what has been going on in Ukraine over recent weeks , which represents a fundamental shi@@ ft in the internal political situation towards democracy , freedom and human rights .
it was the EU that ac@@ ted as medi@@ a@@ tor in the country , and I believe that the sta@@ un@@ ch support of all those concerned , including the Dutch Presidency , has made it possible to achieve progress which will result in a greater degree of democracy , and which has prov@@ en that a united European Union , comb@@ ining its forces and de@@ plo@@ ying them join@@ tly , can make a genuine contribution to international politics .
for this we are grateful , and we would like to extend our renew@@ ed thanks to all those involved , including Mr Solana , Mr K@@ wa@@ ś@@ ni@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ ki and also the Dutch Presidency .
Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , I would ask you to pass on our group &apos;s thanks to the Council .
. Mr President , the Netherlands presidency is likely to be re@@ memb@@ ered for the decision on Turkey .
a majority of the members of the A@@ lli@@ ance of Liber@@ als and Democrats for Europe believe that Turkey ful@@ f@@ ils the political criteria and that you should open negotiations .
it seems to us important that Europe should not define itself as a Christian c@@ lu@@ b .
and yet , by the same to@@ ken , we must be@@ w@@ are of an ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism , which could dri@@ ve away many of those who bel@@ ong in our community .
I pay tribu@@ te to the work of Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings in drawing up the report on Turkey for this House ; a report which I think com@@ man@@ ds wid@@ es@@ pread support .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , when it dis@@ cus@@ ses Turkey , your Council will meet in sec@@ ret .
it is important that in this House , when we discuss and vote on Turkey , we do so open@@ ly and in public and not in sec@@ ret .
I also recommen@@ d to the Council that we have a discussion in our Union about the European Union &apos;s capacity to ab@@ sor@@ b new Member States , particularly countries beyond those which currently have candidate status .
I recommen@@ d that we have a discussion on the nature of the European Union , because it is our vision of the European Union that will determin@@ e its borders , rather than our vision of countries wis@@ hing to join .
the Council will also discuss Bulgar@@ ia and Romania .
my Group has long believ@@ ed that these two countries - and indeed others - should have separate accession tre@@ aties .
Bulgar@@ ia closed all of its negotiating c@@ hap@@ ters earlier this year and has made good progress .
in Romania , progress has been much less easy to see .
for me , the election results this week give cause for hope .
I believe that the concerns of many can now be set asi@@ de and that with resolve and go@@ od@@ will , we can bring Romania into the European Union effectively in 2007 .
I say to my fri@@ end Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z : for he@@ av@@ en &apos;s sa@@ ke stop def@@ ending cor@@ rup@@ t soci@@ alist reg@@ imes , whether in the Mal@@ di@@ ves , the Se@@ y@@ che@@ ll@@ es or in Romania .
I thought Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u was actually a member of the Soci@@ alist International , but I may be wrong .
you should not be def@@ ending reg@@ imes which are doing things that are not wor@@ thy of your party .
I believe that we now have the chance to move ahead with Romania and we must do so .
on C@@ roati@@ a , President @-@ in @-@ Office , I recommen@@ d that you hold open the do@@ or , but insist on full cooperation with the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al for the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via .
high on your agenda , too , will be terrorism and I pay tribu@@ te to the work of the Council &apos;s anti @-@ terrorism co@@ ord@@ ina@@ tor .
you need pro@@ mp@@ tly to put into practice measures that have been identi@@ fied in the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme relevant to combating terrorism , in particular , measures relating to exchange of information between Member States .
efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Council must stress the importance of promoting respect based on univers@@ al values , toler@@ ance , dialogue and democratic participation .
too often , our approach in this Union to the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice has concentra@@ ted on security and justice at the expen@@ se of freedom .
I hope that your presidency , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , will ensure that the balance is set right .
we need to get our police forces and judic@@ i@@ ary working together .
we need to move the European Union from being simply an economic community into seeing itself as a community of values .
but for that to have the support of our citizens , it means recogn@@ ising the fundamental importance of the values out@@ lined in our Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the appropriate financial framework will be discussed in a building ap@@ tly na@@ med after a D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man , Mr J@@ us@@ tus L@@ ip@@ si@@ us .
my Group wel@@ comes the meth@@ od@@ ical approach of your presidency to prepar@@ ations for the Union &apos;s budget from 2007 to 20@@ 13 , but we are not sure whether your building b@@ loc@@ ks are independent building b@@ loc@@ ks or a Ru@@ bi@@ k &apos;s C@@ u@@ be .
is any outcome possible other than the one per cent to which your country was a sig@@ n@@ atory in the letter to Mr Prodi ?
it seems to my Group that we need to give the European Union the resources it needs .
it is better to spen@@ d 1.@@ 2 per cent well than to spen@@ d less than 1 per cent b@@ ad@@ ly .
while , as a S@@ co@@ t , I welcome the approach of my sou@@ l@@ ma@@ tes in the Netherlands to the financing of the Union , I believe that the Council must give the Union the resources it needs .
you must also he@@ ed the report of the Court of Auditors and tackle the failure in our Member States to put adequate controls in place on the spending of European Union money .
in conclusion , the Council will discuss E@@ S@@ DP .
operation &apos; Al@@ the@@ a &apos; is working success@@ fully and three other ongoing mis@@ sions are examples of sol@@ id progress .
let the Union &apos;s voice be heard in our neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy and in our relations with China , the United States and Russia .
although the head@@ line of the forthcoming European Council may be Turkey - and we should expect no less for a pillar of European civil@@ isation - beyond the head@@ lines there is much important work to do in foreign and security policy .
Mr President , I have never made use of this Rule before , but I would ask to be allowed the following clari@@ fication .
I would never defend a cor@@ rup@@ t regime , whether head@@ ed by soci@@ alists or by anyone else , and this is something I should like to stress at this point .
rather than def@@ ending anyone , I merely appe@@ al@@ ed to Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u .
I made no reference to any cor@@ rup@@ t politic@@ ian , in any country , and I should like , here and now , to say that any person who is cor@@ rup@@ t should be pun@@ ished and should not head a government .
it is however equally unacceptable for people to come under general sus@@ pic@@ ion merely because they bel@@ ong to a certain political family .
it is clear that Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z has spoken pursu@@ ant to Rule 14@@ 5 of the Rules of Procedure , which allows Members to speak for three minu@@ tes in response to personal comments made during the debate .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall use two minu@@ tes of Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z &apos;s speaking time , which means that I have five minu@@ tes to speak .
our debate today is on culture , and on what is and what is not European culture .
it is an issue on which I should like to make a few comments .
I am always sc@@ ep@@ tical when anyone tell@@ s me that things are cul@@ turally in@@ compatible , and this is perhaps due to family reasons .
we are all aware of how often J@@ e@@ ws have been per@@ secu@@ ted for mar@@ rying non @-@ J@@ e@@ ws , and how often wh@@ ite people have been per@@ secu@@ ted for mar@@ rying b@@ lack people , and such per@@ secu@@ tion has always been carried out under the pre@@ text of cultural in@@ compati@@ bility .
I am also as@@ ton@@ ished at the em@@ o@@ tional fer@@ v@@ our , or in some cases even political b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , with which debates relating to Turkey are conduc@@ ted .
I am well aware that there are wor@@ thy people with wor@@ thy arguments who are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU .
it is entirely normal for wor@@ thy arguments to exist both for and against such an accession , and yet I am per@@ ple@@ xed by the level of ag@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ veness of those who are opposed to Turkey join@@ ing the EU .
the basis for rac@@ ism is always ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ ality , and I cannot help but think that certain arguments against Turkey &apos;s accession are not political , but pu@@ rely cultural , or , in other words , rac@@ ist .
we cannot toler@@ ate such a thing .
what kind of an example are we setting to Turkey and to the world ?
Mr Poettering has told this House that this is the most important decision to be taken by the European Parliament and by Europe in recent years , and that , as it is so important , we should take the decision in ut@@ most sec@@ rec@@ y , so that everyone is left in the d@@ ar@@ k with regard to how we have reached our position on this important issue .
this House is to hold a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot .
can you just be qui@@ et ?
after@@ wards , you may speak for three minu@@ tes , like Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z .
I shall say what I wish to say , and you may say what you wish to say .
you may speak after I have fin@@ ished .
if Members of this House demand sec@@ rec@@ y , it is because they do not want vo@@ ters throughout Europe to know where we as individual Members stand on this key issue .
it is a dis@@ gra@@ ce to democracy that the vote should be conduc@@ ted in this way .
it is a s@@ cand@@ al .
you should give some consideration to what the people of Turkey will think .
one can perfectly well be opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , but what will the men and women of Turkey think if they are told that this is an issue they are not allowed to know anything about ?
do Europeans really want us to hold sit@@ t@@ ings in public and to provide public recor@@ ds of votes , as pre@@ ac@@ hed repe@@ a@@ tedly and especially in Mr Poettering &apos;s inc@@ es@@ san@@ t ser@@ mon@@ s to the Council ?
this is something we wish to know , and this is something that is en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the Constitution .
this Parliament , a mor@@ al authority for good behaviour , has su@@ d@@ den@@ ly decided on the most in@@ comprehen@@ sible and un@@ democratic course of action possible , and I find this impossible to understand .
I should like to make one more re@@ mark on Romania .
cultural differences sometimes also exist between the EU and soci@@ eties which will shor@@ tly be join@@ ing it , for example the per@@ va@@ sive cor@@ ruption in Romania , something which is a simple fact .
we therefore call on the Roman@@ ian Parliament to take us seriously .
Romania should be accepted into the EU , but only after it has met the Copenhagen criteria .
at present it does not yet meet them , which is a fact that must be stated , and we should not accept it until it does .
Romania will be accepted ...
... make use of a Rule of which others have also ava@@ iled themselves , and I have no doub@@ ts as to this being the case .
despite any claim@@ s to the contrary by Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , I am not connec@@ ted in any way to this matter , and I dis@@ approve of his having used bo@@ g@@ us arguments which bear no relation to the truth .
. Mr President , on 17 December a decision is to be taken on whether accession negotiations with Turkey should be open@@ ed .
accession to the EU represents a major opportunity for Turkey , as there is still a need for the values it represents , such as the rule of law , democracy and human rights , to gain accep@@ tance there .
there is therefore an urgent need for the negotiations to be conduc@@ ted transpar@@ ently , and for the democratic changes necessary in Turkey to be spe@@ lled out .
this is particularly true in the case of the viol@@ ent clas@@ hes in the K@@ ur@@ dis@@ h regions , and I would call on the K@@ ur@@ ds and the Turkish armed forces to reach a ce@@ ase@@ fir@@ e and to seek a political solution .
I am extremely concerned at the increase in human rights viol@@ ations and hom@@ ic@@ ides , for example the case of the 12 @-@ year @-@ old U@@ ru@@ d and his fa@@ ther , as well as the new proceedings which have been initi@@ ated with the aim of bann@@ ing the Union of E@@ duc@@ ation and S@@ ci@@ ence Wor@@ kers .
if there are to be accession negotiations , it would be up to Turkey to demonstrate , by means of a genuine implementation of its reform plans , that all Turkish citizens , regar@@ d@@ less of their origin , are accor@@ ded the same rights , that there is equality of the sex@@ es and that certain religi@@ ons are no longer discrimin@@ ated against in favour of others .
it is crucial for the An@@ kar@@ a Government not only to adopt laws in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria , but also to implement them in practice .
the 20 million K@@ ur@@ ds in Turkey hope that , when accession negotiations are open@@ ed , their rights , too , will be secu@@ red , that they will be able to express their id@@ entity fre@@ ely , that they will be acknowled@@ ged and that it will become possible for them to return to their vill@@ ages .
it is necessary for the vill@@ age gu@@ ard system to be ab@@ olis@@ hed and for the 10 % clause for elections to be reduced .
last wee@@ ken@@ d thousands of people demonstrated in Di@@ y@@ ar@@ b@@ a@@ ki@@ r for the opening of accession negotiations .
as a German ME@@ P of K@@ ur@@ dis@@ h origin , I should like to join my group in calling for accession negotiations with Turkey to be open@@ ed , and we call on all Heads of Government to make known , on 17 December , their support for the opening of accession negotiations .
the European Union should not fear An@@ kar@@ a , and An@@ kar@@ a should not fear Di@@ y@@ ar@@ b@@ a@@ ki@@ r .
Turkey can act as a br@@ id@@ ge between the EU and Isla@@ mic countries .
Mr President , I want to make my point of order just as Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z made his .
last month you ref@@ used a point of order from me because I did not mention the number of the Rule .
on this occasion , Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z was allowed to make a point of order without men@@ tioning a Rule number .
could you say what the rules are and why there is one rule for him and another for me ?
I believe that you are invo@@ king Rule 14@@ 5 .
I am merely asking why there is one rule for him and one rule for me .
you were in the cha@@ ir both times .
is it not time that you understood the Rules ?
Mr K@@ na@@ p@@ man , please be@@ have properly .
if you wish to speak , please tell me which Rule you wish to invo@@ ke .
if you tell me that you wish to speak on the basis of no particular Rule , you do not have the right to take the floor .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the next Council summit will focus on Turkey , and I shall do the same in my speech , even though the French soverei@@ gn@@ ists , as I noted the day before yesterday , have already made known the reasons for their opposition .
this time I would like to look at the issue from a different ang@@ le , and to war@@ n the Council against the decision it is going to take .
it is my beli@@ ef that this decision will have extremely serious consequences , not merely as a result of Turkey &apos;s entry , but also in terms of the European Union &apos;s im@@ age amongst the peoples of Europe .
firstly , the public is less and less sure of what we regard as our borders .
if Turkey were allowed to join , the borders would be b@@ l@@ ur@@ red , and the do@@ or would be open to a large number of Turkish @-@ speaking countries , including the countries of the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us such as Geor@@ gia .
in short , we are currently sli@@ pp@@ ing into a kind of world state , the foun@@ d@@ ation for which is merely a ha@@ z@@ y ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ gue of good inten@@ tions labe@@ lled &apos; human rights . &quot;
this development is in@@ comprehen@@ sible to many Europeans , all the more so because - and this is my second point - we are at the same time turning our back on what Europeans see as the ess@@ ence of Europe , and what has been lo@@ os@@ ely , and perhaps c@@ lu@@ m@@ si@@ ly , described as its Christian ro@@ ots .
in s@@ pite of everything , there is a very well @-@ defined idea of the way of life and civil@@ is@@ ations of which Europe is made up .
we are moving ever further away from these , and we no doubt do not realise the extent to which we are in@@ sul@@ ting and sho@@ cking citizens , tra@@ pped as we are in the h@@ us@@ t@@ le and bus@@ t@@ le of the glob@@ alised el@@ ite .
my third point is that the first consequences will not be long in coming .
the forthcoming referendum has meant that the French people are beginning to see the link between Turkey and the Constitution , and they will vote accord@@ ingly .
I would therefore like to remind the Council of their responsibility for the outcome of the decisions they take next F@@ rid@@ ay .
. Mr President , no matter how much you try to d@@ ance around the issue , the subject of Turkey is b@@ ound to be div@@ isi@@ ve .
it is b@@ ound to create the kind of ten@@ sions and inf@@ la@@ me the pas@@ sions that we have seen not only here this morning , but also in our debate yesterday .
one of the most important issues that we have to look at as a Parliament and as a Union is : what message do we send if we ref@@ use to open the do@@ or to negotiations with Turkey at the wee@@ ken@@ d ?
we set down certain rules and criteria which must be met by Turkey before negotiations can be allowed to begin .
the Commission has laid out a very clear b@@ lu@@ ep@@ rin@@ t of how much has been achieved and what has yet to be done before we reach the final h@@ ur@@ dle .
but we have also deman@@ ded that Turkey should fulfil its responsibilities and du@@ ties .
there is , for instance , the question of the recognition of Cyprus and the independence and inte@@ gr@@ ity of Cyprus .
then there are certain human rights issues that were mentioned by Mr Co@@ û@@ te@@ au@@ x , the previous speak@@ er .
it is interesting to hear a K@@ ur@@ d speaking about Turkey being part of the European Union .
that is an important message that we should take acknowledge and follow .
our voice , our message , will determin@@ e whether or not the voice of moder@@ ate Mus@@ lim@@ s will be heard or whether we dri@@ ve people back into a fundamenta@@ list response and attitude .
that is why , if we op@@ pose Turkey coming into the European Union because we are fe@@ ar@@ ful of its impact on our econom@@ ies or its impact on the balance of power within the institutions , we should say so clearly .
we should not try to h@@ ide behind some fal@@ se pre@@ tence that it is going to change the way Europe oper@@ ates fore@@ ver .
the European Union of today is a very different animal from its 197@@ 3 inc@@ ar@@ nation .
indeed , one of the things that is la@@ cking in the European Union of today is the vision and ins@@ pi@@ ration of the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers who made the p@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x of peace , prosperity and solidarity rise from the as@@ hes .
the responsibility of and on@@ us on this generation to extend a hand to other countries is as great today as it was in the 19@@ 4@@ 0@@ s and 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
indeed , quite a few members of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats wish to vote against the Eur@@ l@@ ings report because they are s@@ quar@@ ely opposed to Turkey join@@ ing , but d@@ are to do so only when the way they vote is conc@@ e@@ al@@ ed from the general public .
for fear of possible criticism , though , and of all the consequences that this enta@@ ils for their care@@ ers in their own countries , where their governments , ha@@ u@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly lau@@ gh@@ ing off pop@@ ular opinion , want to give An@@ kar@@ a the go @-@ ahead the day after tomorrow , they will not do so if the vote is public and not sec@@ ret .
the same may apply to quite a few Members of the Soci@@ alist Group .
I would remind you of the val@@ i@@ ant positions taken up in France on the Turkey issue by R@@ ob@@ er@@ t B@@ ad@@ in@@ ter , Hu@@ ber@@ t V@@ é@@ dr@@ ine and the former Soci@@ alist E@@ duc@@ ation Minister , C@@ la@@ ude A@@ ll@@ è@@ g@@ re , all of whom have cau@@ tioned us about the disas@@ tro@@ us consequences of Turkey &apos;s possible accession .
it is indic@@ ative of the lack of democratic op@@ enn@@ ess with which this issue has been addressed for years now .
in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , only three minu@@ tes were taken to discuss the question as to whether Turkey should obtain candidate status .
that is what is re@@ ported by the former European Commissioner for the Internal Market , Mr Bolkestein , who was the only person with the courage to tell Mr Prodi that he ref@@ used to approve the positive Commission recommendation of 6 October .
three minu@@ tes to decide whether we move the ho@@ t@@ b@@ ed@@ s of conflict in the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us and the Middle East to Europe &apos;s b@@ oun@@ d@@ aries .
three minu@@ tes to decide whether tomorrow , we will again offer millions of immigrants the opportunity to flo@@ od our continent .
three minu@@ tes to decide whether we allow a country , where human rights in general and women &apos;s rights in particular are viol@@ ated on a large scale , entry into our Union as a so @-@ called model sec@@ ular state and stra@@ ight away give them the larg@@ est number of votes in the Council .
three minu@@ tes to give the go @-@ ahead to a country that ref@@ uses to recognise another Member State and occ@@ up@@ ies part of that Member State with 3@@ 0@@ .000 tro@@ op@@ s after having committed un@@ told crimes against human@@ ity .
three minu@@ tes to give the go @-@ ahead to a country where the state &apos;s den@@ ial of the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide is organised by the Minis@@ try of E@@ duc@@ ation , while nobody in Europe ut@@ ters a word about this .
I ask you , Europe , where are your gr@@ and principles ?
Mr President , we are at an important c@@ ros@@ s@@ ro@@ ads here in this House and the key issue these days - not only in politics , but also among the public - is , of course , the possible start of negotiations with Turkey .
as rapporteur , I should like to say , as I have said before , that my vis@@ its there have left me in two min@@ ds .
on the one hand , there is a great deal of progress , and im@@ pres@@ sive progress too ; on the other , Turkey is still tra@@ il@@ ing behind quite a bit if we were to compar@@ e that country with a country that really wants to become a Member of the European Union .
that is why reforms have to continue in the areas of human rights , women &apos;s rights and religious freedom .
I cannot emphasise enough that pressure in those areas must be simply un@@ re@@ l@@ enting .
indeed , the Turkish media and Turkish journ@@ alists urge us to use the s@@ tic@@ k and car@@ ro@@ t approach and keep up the pressure .
human rights have to be implemented more effectively .
a s@@ wit@@ ch in men@@ tal@@ ity is required in the area of religious minorities , so that people are pro@@ ud of minority religi@@ ons instead of trying to op@@ press them .
in the field of , for example , the law on foun@@ dations , further legal amendments must be tabled in order to offer scope to minority religi@@ ons and minority cul@@ tures .
that is why , quite apart from the whole cor@@ e discussion that has been going on for months in this House and elsewhere , I should like to press home the fact that it would be good if an important sec@@ tion of the report that is now before us for final vote were also to be included in the Council &apos;s conclusions .
it concerns the following .
I shall read out a few sen@@ tences in Eng@@ lis@@ h , because I have the Eng@@ lis@@ h text in fron@@ t of me .
I think that this emphasis on the political criteria is necessary , because not everyone in Turkey realis@@ es that the reforms will need to be carried out consisten@@ tly if the country really wants to quali@@ fy for membership of the European Union .
I think that these further reforms will determin@@ e whether or not Turkey will be able to do this .
I have another brief re@@ mark to make .
if we discuss political criteria , then I would like to say that if I compar@@ e Turkey to , for example , Romania , and I consider the poor treatment in pris@@ ons , the p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal attacks on investi@@ ga@@ tive journ@@ alists and cor@@ ruption , I take the view that the Council should send out a message , and maximum pressure should be brought to bear in order to solve such matters .
in my view , those practices are not in line with the political criteria which we up@@ hold .
my final re@@ mark concerns terrorism .
I am glad that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has made this a key issue .
I am also glad that the Netherlands - in the spirit of prac@@ tis@@ ing what you pre@@ ach - will now finally start bann@@ ing organisations that are on the European list of terrorists .
I should like to ask the presidency to con@@ ve@@ y to the other Member States that we should stand united in this .
consequently , to name but one concrete example , ET@@ A should be bann@@ ed in all countries , and not only in Spain and France .
can the presidency guarantee now that with the exchange of information agreement , it will no longer be possible for one country to hold information about attacks in another country , without this information being autom@@ ati@@ cally ex@@ changed ?
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that Parliament will adopt the Eur@@ l@@ ings report on Turkey in the ver@@ sion approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and I also hope it will do so by sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot .
I believe that my fellow Members are wrong in thinking that a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot may favour a shi@@ ft away from that position ; on the contrary , I expect that Members in this Chamber will demonstrate that they are not subject to any pres@@ su@@ res when fre@@ ely car@@ rying out their mandate .
as regards the remain@@ der of the foreign reports , I agree with much of what Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï said and I should like to express our agreement on all the measures that bring forward constitutional reforms .
in the Hi@@ gh Re@@ pres@@ enta@@ tive &apos;s actions in Ukraine we have g@@ lim@@ p@@ sed a sign that the initiative in that direction is being strength@@ ened .
the initiative should , however , be supported by more substantial instruments , which are for@@ eseen in the Constitution but which might perhaps be brought forward .
with regard to the neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy , we encourage the Commission and the Council in their work .
we point out the danger , however , that the measures to create a free @-@ trade area may take preced@@ ence over the other policies .
I would stress that we do not just want to create a free @-@ trade area , and so we should be careful not to wea@@ ken the policy &apos;s regional and sub@@ regional dimension .
as regards human rights and democracy , I recommen@@ d that we negoti@@ ate a proper convention with our neighbour@@ ing countries .
such a convention should at last s@@ pel@@ l out the shared values that we so often refer to and define them carefully in for@@ mal terms , particularly for the sa@@ ke of the Mediterranean countries .
the convention should make those values known to the people whom they concern and it should set up joint institutions that can guarantee them .
regarding the Middle East , we must ensure that the presid@@ ential elections in Palestin@@ e give the road ma@@ p a new bo@@ ost and that the Israeli Government &apos;s unila@@ teral decisions , such as the with@@ dra@@ w@@ al from G@@ az@@ a , are included in the negotiations with the Qu@@ ar@@ te@@ t , so that the creation of the Palestinian state can be comple@@ ted within the established time fra@@ me .
to that end , this issue will have to be placed at the heart of the relationship between the European Union and the United States .
on the subject of Iraq , we consider that the hop@@ ed @-@ for tur@@ n@@ around has failed to materi@@ alise even after the Shar@@ m el @-@ S@@ he@@ ik@@ h conference and that the aim of holding elections may well be je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed by the viol@@ ent situation in the country .
finally , I call on the Council and the Commission to de@@ vote attention also to the situation in C@@ am@@ bo@@ dia , where there is a humanitarian emergency concerning children .
Mr President , the Dutch Presidency is ne@@ arly at an end .
in the first place , I should like to ass@@ ess the efforts it has made towards reducing regulation at European level .
the aim was to end the Brussels bureauc@@ racy and to cut the number of regulations it produced by at least 25 % .
need@@ less to say , we are far from reaching that perc@@ enta@@ ge , but the t@@ one has been set , and I regard that as a great b@@ on@@ us in itself .
after all , if there are fe@@ wer rules and regulations , there is more room for ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ ship , because it is the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ s who have to sa@@ ve the European economy .
I still think it des@@ ira@@ ble , though , to ap@@ point a European Commissioner to focus sol@@ ely on the elimin@@ ation of super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous and ob@@ sol@@ ete rules .
a second to@@ pic addressed during the Dutch Presidency was the so @-@ called H@@ ag@@ ue decisions about terrorism and combating crime .
the agreements reached in The H@@ ag@@ ue ill@@ ustra@@ te that the European Union and the Council too - at long last - consider the fight against terrorism and crime as one of their priorities .
at the same time , a balance has been struc@@ k between an effective approach and ex@@ tra legal scope on the one hand and the protection of personal data and fundamental freedoms on the other .
after all , we are still being put through our pac@@ es on that sc@@ or@@ e , and I think that the Council has done a reason@@ ably good job .
the to@@ pic of human rights has not received a great deal of attention , but sound work has been done on it .
I would particularly mention the protection of the def@@ end@@ ers of human rights .
under the Dutch Presidency , the practical implementation of the EU directives concerning human rights def@@ end@@ ers has mo@@ ved one step closer .
a man@@ ual will be comp@@ iled for the EU dele@@ gations across the world ; it will provide for a pro@@ mp@@ t , flexible and consistent re@@ action from the EU when human rights def@@ end@@ ers are in peri@@ l of death or are at risk of abuse .
I congratulate Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï on the inclu@@ sion in the agenda of the need for good communication about European integration .
the public still considers Europe to be far remo@@ ved from their own personal lives and are far too ready to turn their bac@@ ks on it .
it is only by frequ@@ ent communication and a constan@@ t dialogue with the citizen , not only by the Members of this House , but also by the members of the Commission and the Council , that this ga@@ p can be br@@ id@@ ged .
I should like to fin@@ ish off with a re@@ mark about the debate about standards and values with which this presidency started .
as a Liberal , I feel hes@@ i@@ tant about such a debate , in general , and about the pu@@ rely Christian nature that the Christian Democrats ten@@ d to l@@ end it , in particular .
I also find it objec@@ tion@@ able that the L@@ ef@@ t have de@@ valu@@ ed the terms &apos; standards &quot; and &apos; values . &quot;
it is important that this debate should have made a start ; after all , it is a debate about what Europe is , where it should be head@@ ing , where our b@@ oun@@ d@@ aries are and what we are doing , or not , as the case may be .
in short , it is a debate about where our foun@@ dations li@@ e .
money is not , indeed , the EU &apos;s only .
I think that Mr Bal@@ ken@@ en@@ de &apos;s ar@@ ticle in of 7 December was excellent ; one of his conclusions was that the Union is about dyna@@ mic values .
I see these as including respect , responsibility and confidence .
we have in any event made a start on the discussion and although the end is not in si@@ ght by a long way , this is still worth a compl@@ im@@ ent for this presidency .
on a final note , the presidency has defin@@ i@@ tely brought the European Union closer to the Dutch people and even to members of the Dutch parliament .
this , I know , is Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï &quot; s cr@@ us@@ ade , and it has proved very successful ; as a Dutch ME@@ P , I too am pleased with it .
Mr President , I should like to start with the financial perspective .
at the summit , I hope that you will really take the time to discuss at l@@ eng@@ th the kind of Europe that you have in mind , before you pass this subject back to the speci@@ alist ministers .
some Member States want a small@@ er budget than the present one , which is just above 1 % .
the Council pres@@ cri@@ b@@ es that no cu@@ ts must be made in the agricultural budget , and it seems un@@ likely that any agreement will be reached on cu@@ ts in the structural funds .
where do you think cu@@ ts will be made ?
they will be made in research and development , human rights , the environment , external affairs , y@@ outh ex@@ changes and culture - precisely those areas which are close to people &apos;s hear@@ ts and which visi@@ bly add value at European level .
a budget that is bor@@ n of euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism will only bre@@ ed more of it .
with regard to terrorism , the draft conclusions of the forthcoming summit state that we , in our efforts to fight terrorism , must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms .
while agre@@ eing with those conditions , I fear that this may be no more than an inc@@ anta@@ tion .
I would refer to the discussion about s@@ tor@@ ing commun@@ ications data of all tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one and Internet users or the bi@@ omet@@ ri@@ c data on pass@@ ports .
the mo@@ t@@ to is : strict , stric@@ ter , stric@@ test .
it seems almost in@@ appropriate to ask critical questions about the effectiveness or the legitim@@ acy of measures against terrorism .
like all ar@@ my gener@@ als , those fighting terrorism in Europe always want the top ge@@ ar .
at least in defence pur@@ ch@@ ases , politicians always independ@@ ently w@@ ei@@ gh up costs and benefits .
where measures to fight terrorism are concerned , though , almost nobody d@@ ar@@ es make this critical assessment .
nonetheless , I would inv@@ ite you to do just that at the forthcoming summit , because at this rate , we will m@@ ess up our rule of law , and terrorists will have their way after all .
finally , I should like to make a brief comment about transparency .
the Dutch Presidency has ple@@ d@@ ged to try to emphasise the implementation of the clause in the Constitution on the basis of which the Member States will have public meetings h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th - after all , they were all agreed on this when the Constitution was signed - or at least hold more of them in public .
I should like to ask Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï what he has achieved on that sc@@ or@@ e .
I hope that during the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , the do@@ ors of the Council of Ministers will be truly open .
we will then be able to see in all op@@ enn@@ ess what is going on , and it will be possible for ministers to be held responsible for the decisions taken , as we today are keen to be held responsible for the decision we are taking on Turkey .
- La@@ dies and gentlemen , the conclusions of the summit of the European Union to be held on 16 and 17 December are so important that they determin@@ e to a significant degree the p@@ hy@@ si@@ og@@ n@@ om@@ y of the European Union .
enlargement , with the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey , requires decisions , the consequences of which will be decisive .
we must clarify from the out@@ set that we are not against Turkey &apos;s European pros@@ pects .
we expect such pros@@ pects to bin@@ d any country pursu@@ ing such pros@@ pects within a minimum framework of obligations per@@ tain@@ ing to basic issues which apply to the other Member States , such as fundamental freedoms , civil rights and workers &apos; rights , without of course har@@ bour@@ ing any ill@@ u@@ sions .
however , these obligations must be laid down from the out@@ set and be accepted by Turkey .
how could it ever be possible for a candidate country to be allowed not to recognise the existence of another Member State and for this issue not to be clearly laid down at the summit ?
how will this question be answ@@ ered if there is real equality between the Member States or if , ultimately , there are two s@@ ets of standards and two y@@ ar@@ d@@ s@@ tic@@ ks ?
it is , in my opinion , a not only for there to be mutual recognition but also for there to be nor@@ m@@ alisation of relations between Cyprus and Turkey , not only because the European Union and the principles which go@@ ver@@ n its operation so comm@@ and , but also because the Cyprus problem needs to be resolved in order for right to pre@@ va@@ il for the benefit of our people , both Greek Cy@@ pri@@ ots and Turkish Cy@@ pri@@ ots .
no nation in the world wants the illegal occu@@ pation of and ha@@ t@@ red and part@@ ition in their country and this cannot be per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated .
the European Union must open a w@@ in@@ dow for the safe@@ guar@@ ding of the basic principles of its very existence and call for the application of this minimum framework of obligations and must also open a w@@ in@@ dow for the simple citizens by show@@ ing that it does not take decisions using two s@@ ets of standards and two y@@ ar@@ d@@ s@@ tic@@ ks .
to close , I wish to condemn the ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant conduct of the Turkish lead@@ ership and its government when , in the statements it makes , the impression is given that it is the European Union which is asking for Turkey to join and not Turkey which is asking to join the European Union .
Mr President , nothing could show Mr Barroso &apos;s con@@ te@@ mp@@ t for this Parliament more than the fact that he could only atten@@ d this debate for a few minu@@ tes before dis@@ appe@@ aring .
on the subject of Ukraine , after the way in which he pus@@ hed through the election of his crimin@@ als and Commissioners , let us stop pre@@ ten@@ ding that we can in any way lec@@ ture Ukraine on democracy .
with regard to Turkey , we will not be supporting its membership application , just as we did not in the last Parliament , on the grounds of both cost and likely mi@@ gration pat@@ ter@@ ns .
had any@@ body in authority been here , I would have asked for confir@@ mation that the cost could be in the order of G@@ B@@ P 19 billion or EUR 28 million .
this means that Turkey is cos@@ ting us as much as the ten countries that acc@@ ed@@ ed to this Union this year .
could we please know what the cost will be , because for the first time you are hear@@ ing from a nation that is actually pa@@ ying for it .
although the L@@ ab@@ our Party in Bri@@ tain wants to put G@@ B@@ P 5 billion towards it , the Con@@ serva@@ tive Party believes that G@@ B@@ P 5 billion is a good price to pay and believes you can still have tax cu@@ ts .
pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly it also thin@@ ks that pi@@ gs can f@@ ly .
can we actually have confir@@ mation of the cost of 19 billion ?
also , will some EUR 7@@ 00 million be spent on around 60 di@@ ver@@ se training projects in Turkey ?
is that the true cost , or is there a more up @-@ to @-@ date fig@@ ure ?
we know that Turkey &apos;s population growth rate remains p@@ hen@@ omen@@ al and that it has serious economic problems , including 70 per cent inf@@ lation .
se@@ v@@ enty per cent inf@@ lation during the pas@@ sa@@ ge of the Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t Treaty would have caused some ra@@ ising of e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws , but it is just a political project here , is it not ?
especially for those who do not pay .
we also know that human rights concerns are wid@@ es@@ pread .
on that basis I would say , on behalf of the UK In@@ depend@@ ence Party , that we will offer Turkey fri@@ end@@ ship and free trade , but we will not offer the country political union - especially with the cor@@ ruption and fraud that are en@@ dem@@ ic in this place .
we have often said that Bulgar@@ ia and Romania ought to join the Union , though we are particularly concerned about the areas in which there is still a wide ga@@ p between the current situation in those two countries and the European average .
in that respect we would point to their legislation on human rights , social protection for workers and economic development , which should reach significant levels by the end of the dec@@ ade .
although in principle we are in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey - which , I stress , is a very different thing from accession - we must not forget the need for its acknowled@@ g@@ ement of the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide and for a las@@ ting solution to the Cyprus question .
to some@@ body with any common sense , it is in@@ comprehen@@ sible that a country that as@@ pi@@ res to join the Union should be mili@@ tar@@ ily occ@@ up@@ ying part of another country that is already a member .
we are not at all wor@@ ried about the voting system that we should use .
I believe in the freedom of all Members to make their own decisions , regar@@ d@@ less of whether the vote is open or in sec@@ ret .
I think this is just a form@@ ality and certainly not a question of any substance .
the fight against terrorism is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situation in certain countries where conflicts are not yet over .
I believe , however , that the Union should maintain an ever str@@ onger presence through its policies and aid in those parts of the world that sur@@ round it and in which there are ongoing , sometimes tragic situations of conflict .
by doing so it can exer@@ t a sta@@ bil@@ ising influence to support those sec@@ tions of society that accept the values which character@@ ise our democracy .
Mr President , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï will not leave the Chamber this time , as he did during the last debate on the EU &apos;s relations with Russia .
Mr Barroso , who has already left , said that the December Council would be a great step towards the building of a more prosper@@ ous Europe .
jud@@ ging from Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï &quot; s comments , however , it is more likely to be a small and ti@@ mid step , not a great one .
I am not the only one who fe@@ els that the Council is working without any kind of serious vision and without any long @-@ term strategy , that it l@@ ur@@ ches from one event to another , and that it merely reac@@ ts to problems without any long @-@ term plan of how it should act to avoid them .
this lack of strategy is a fundamental er@@ ro@@ r , and it gives rise to a great many problems .
much is now being said by the Council on the subject of Ukraine , and many of its comments are entirely relevant .
yet if the Council had stated clearly a few months ago , as part of its future strategy , that Ukraine would join the European Union , not today , not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow , but ma@@ y@@ be at the same time as Turkey , then the current situation in Ukraine would not have ar@@ isen , as the Ukrain@@ ian Government would not have been able to affor@@ d to ri@@ g the elections to such an extent .
there is one thing I should like to thank the ab@@ sent Mr Barroso for , namely that he was in favour of a larg@@ er budget for the European Union .
an increase of EUR 1@@ 14 billion over se@@ ven years will promote the development of both the EU and the new Member States .
Mr President , the meeting of the European Council later this week is of historic signific@@ ance , primarily because of the fundamental issue of the opening of negotiations with Turkey on future membership of the EU .
there are very strongly held views on this issue across this Parliament and beyond .
I acknowledge that .
however , the policy of my party is clear : we believe that in the right circumstances Turkish membership of the Union could be good for Europe , good for Turkey and good for relations with the Isla@@ mic world and security in our soci@@ eties .
I accept that the negotiations with Turkey are likely to be l@@ eng@@ thy and at times difficult , but this week the Council should take a first step in that process .
like any other applic@@ ant country , Turkey must satis@@ fy all the criteria required in terms of human rights and economic and political reform .
this might be very difficult , but by agre@@ eing to the for@@ mal opening of negotiations the Council will send a clear message to the Turkish Government that we expect it to work as@@ si@@ du@@ ously to achieve the steps necessary for even@@ tual membership .
the issue of Bulgar@@ ian and Roman@@ ian membership of the Union will also fe@@ a@@ ture on the agenda and the objective there must be to aff@@ ir@@ m the accession of both countries whilst recogn@@ ising that a great amount of work remains to be done - in particular in the case of Romania - to ensure they remain on tra@@ ck .
the issue of economic reform in the Union was discussed at the last Council in November .
however , I hope that the Netherlands presidency and the head@@ s of government will re@@ aff@@ ir@@ m their commitment to k@@ ic@@ k @-@ starting the Lisbon agenda .
earlier this week the Soci@@ alist Group expressed concern at the ne@@ o @-@ liber@@ al nature of the new Commission .
I want to make it clear that we expect Mr Barroso and his te@@ am to be true to their earlier statements on the need to re@@ invi@@ g@@ or@@ ate the economy in Europe and the c@@ rac@@ k @-@ down on red ta@@ pe and regulation .
the out@@ da@@ ted social model so bel@@ o@@ ved of the left is to be re@@ placed with a vi@@ goro@@ us , dyna@@ mic and ra@@ dical reform programme .
this is the only way to deal with the high unemployment and s@@ lu@@ gg@@ ish growth that has led to Europe la@@ gg@@ ing behind the United States and the bur@@ ge@@ on@@ ing econom@@ ies of China and In@@ dia .
if the Commission acts in this way , it will get the full support of British Con@@ serva@@ tives .
Mr President , the next European Council is not just going to give its opinion on Turkey and other issues , but also - as Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï has mentioned - on the broad guidelines for the next financial perspec@@ tives .
I would like to point out once again that the financial perspec@@ tives are an instrument of budgetary dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine and not an accoun@@ ting instrument , an instrument that fundamenta@@ lly ser@@ ves to provide stability and allows for reasonable medium @-@ term planning of the Union &apos;s policies .
this instrument is so important that it appears as a law in the future Constitution .
the Commission yesterday and its President , Mr Barroso , today , have confirmed that they fully accept the proposal of their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or .
Mr Barroso said a moment ago that the Commission &apos;s proposal is a starting point for negotiations of the financial perspec@@ tives .
nevertheless , I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective ener@@ ge@@ tically .
in that way , that starting point could also become a fin@@ is@@ hing point and the Commission would thereby respond to that expression that we mention so often : we cannot create more Europe with fe@@ wer resources .
the Council and Parliament must also fulfil their respec@@ tive responsibilities and face up to the challenges conf@@ ron@@ ting us .
firstly , economic and social cohesion is not just a principle en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the Treaties and enhan@@ ced in the future Constitution , but also a necessary condition for maintaining and protecting the European social model .
secondly , with regard to the enlargement we have just carried out , we must not s@@ par@@ e any effort when it comes to the new citizens of the Union .
thirdly , five years ago we set some very ambitious objectives .
we are at the hal@@ f@@ way point and we are very far from achieving , by 2010 , a competitive knowledge @-@ based society with full employment , as we proposed in Lisbon and Go@@ th@@ en@@ burg .
four@@ th@@ ly , we are in the m@@ iddle of the process of rati@@ fying the European Constitution and the citizens sometimes show even more en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m than their representatives .
faced with these challenges , we cannot be mis@@ er@@ ly towards our citizens .
we would be making a great mis@@ take if we were to try to incorpor@@ ate them into this project we call European integration - and everything it represents - while at the same time reducing the Union &apos;s resources .
we must continue to build a Europe with the necessary resources , with the resources laid down in the Treaty , and use them effici@@ ently .
that would un@@ doub@@ tedly be the best guarantee we can offer future gener@@ ations of a future of peace , freedom and prosperity .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you have had a tou@@ gh Presidency involving many contro@@ versi@@ al issues , dra@@ matic events in the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding world , the procedure sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the Commission and , in particular , the internal political un@@ rest caused by the app@@ all@@ ing mur@@ der of T@@ he@@ o van Go@@ gh .
these factors must have affected your amb@@ itions and efforts when it came to security and combating terrorism .
action plans and programmes are fine , but little has happened so far .
if the European Council can make progress at the Summit , all well and good .
it must not be for@@ go@@ t@@ ten that security and the fight against terrorism must never pus@@ h asi@@ de protection of individual priva@@ cy .
we have deb@@ ated most of the issues on the agenda together in this House .
you were here on Mon@@ day evening and lis@@ tened to the debate on Turkey .
in a few hours &quot; time , we are to vote on Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings &quot; report .
I believe that a sol@@ id majority of MEPs will vote in favour of giving Turkey a date .
in that connection , I wish to say how de@@ pl@@ or@@ able it is that certain people in this House have pus@@ hed through a policy that makes the final vote sec@@ ret .
this Parliament is always at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of op@@ enn@@ ess and transparency , and the politic@@ ian who does not d@@ are to look his or her elector@@ ate in the e@@ ye on this issue has no place in this House .
nonetheless , we expect you to have the courage to take this historic decision and , no@@ t@@ with@@ standing all the difficulties , to give Turkey a starting date with a view to its ob@@ tain@@ ing full membership .
only in that way can the democratic process continue .
this will also give a clear signal to the ten@@ s of thousands of K@@ ur@@ ds in Di@@ y@@ ar@@ b@@ a@@ ki@@ r who , at the wee@@ ken@@ d , demonstrated in favour of EU membership for Turkey .
you mentioned the European security policy , together with dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment .
I assu@@ me that you will be discussing the agreement concluded by Iran with three of the Member States .
it is , of course , extremely positive that T@@ eh@@ er@@ an intends to suspen@@ d its ex@@ trac@@ tion of ur@@ an@@ ium .
there are still , however , considerable doub@@ ts about what really lies behind this decision .
we should be very vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant before making any conc@@ es@@ sions to the Iran@@ ian regime , which must prove that it is serious and that it is not only , as so often , playing a strategic ga@@ me .
the mu@@ lla@@ h@@ s in T@@ eh@@ er@@ an go@@ ver@@ n with an ir@@ on hand a country in which human rights are completely ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted .
there is no reason for re@@ war@@ ding such a country until we see practical improvements in this area .
the Social Democ@@ ratic Government in my country maintain@@ s - although it may be mis@@ taken , as it often is - that the issue of the embar@@ go on arms sal@@ es to China will come up on F@@ rid@@ ay .
if that is the case , I would remind you of the sol@@ id opposition in this House to lif@@ ting the embar@@ go .
this would send out completely the wrong sig@@ n@@ als to the C@@ hin@@ ese regime .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , certain speec@@ hes on Ukraine - Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z &apos;s in particular - have left me with a cu@@ ri@@ ous impression .
after lis@@ tening to certain Members of this House over the past weeks , one could be for@@ given for thinking that the European Union took consistent steps to establish , support and gu@@ ide the democracy movement in Ukraine .
it would be a fine thing if this had been the case , yet in actual fact it appe@@ ared on occasion as though the EU &apos;s high representatives were almost af@@ ra@@ id of so much movement and so much li@@ vely and an@@ im@@ ated democracy , even during the mass demonstra@@ tions .
I believe that less@@ ons must be lear@@ n@@ t from these experi@@ ences in Ukraine , and not only by the Members of this House , but also by the diplom@@ ats of the European Union and of the nation states .
Europe &apos;s security is also dependent on the situation in its neighbour@@ ing countries .
this is something I have heard very frequ@@ ently in recent weeks , yet it is not only our security and our well @-@ being that is always at sta@@ ke .
if we are serious about the European values that we often invo@@ ke , the author@@ ita@@ rian and dicta@@ tor@@ ial systems around us must not be toler@@ ated or accepted , regar@@ d@@ less of our own interests .
at a time of so many changes for the better in Ukraine , which we may have help@@ ed a little towards the end , even though we did far too little , we must be aware how problem@@ atic is the situation of the Belar@@ us@@ sian people and their freedom , and we must also discuss Russia .
it must not be said that President Pu@@ tin and Russia are the same thing , as Russia has the &apos; M@@ em@@ or@@ ial &quot; movement and a very strong freedom movement , and this is something that must influence our diplom@@ atic relations with Russia and our policy towards it .
- Mr President , a few days ahead of the abol@@ ition of the existing quo@@ ta@@ s on the international tex@@ til@@ es and c@@ lo@@ thing trade , there is great concern over the future of thousands of companies and of more than 2@@ .@@ 5 million workers concentra@@ ted mainly in S@@ ou@@ thern European countries .
this sector has already sh@@ ed more than 1 million jobs in the last ten years .
I regret that the debate we requested on this extremely important issue has not taken place here in this House .
it is crucial not only that we announ@@ ce possible measures to prevent companies from clos@@ ing and millions of workers from los@@ ing their jobs , and to dis@@ pe@@ l the threat of poverty and social exclusion that han@@ gs over large areas in which these companies are he@@ a@@ vil@@ y concentra@@ ted , as is the case in Portugal ; it is also crucial that such measures be implemented .
hence the question that I ask once again : how will the impact of ab@@ olis@@ hing the quo@@ ta system in those countries with the greatest concentra@@ tion of the tex@@ til@@ es and c@@ lo@@ thing industry be taken into account so that unemployment is preven@@ ted from getting any worse and so that this extremely important industry is def@@ en@@ ded ?
I ask you , Commissioner , to ensure that this question reac@@ hes the President of the Commission , who did not de@@ ign to hear our question .
Mr President , the EU Constitution and Turkey constitute a mis@@ mat@@ ch .
common citiz@@ en@@ ship and votes according to population figures will destro@@ y the EU and give rise to domin@@ ance by the big powers .
I want to see a Europe in which large and pop@@ ul@@ ous nations are able to operate better in con@@ jun@@ ction with small countries .
I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put its name to a commun@@ ications strategy that will take money from op@@ pon@@ ents of the Constitution and make it available for pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da on the part of ad@@ her@@ ents of the Constitution .
that is in conflict with the principle of equality and is thus illegal .
it is s@@ cand@@ al@@ ous .
the money used for pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da is there for the purpose of sell@@ ing an un@@ democratic Constitution to the elector@@ ate .
it would be easier to ensure that the democracy we are los@@ ing in the Member States were at least comb@@ ined in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people .
the EU Constitution makes it inc@@ redi@@ bly difficult to amen@@ d the con@@ ten@@ ts of laws .
any change to one of the numerous policies loc@@ ked into the Constitution must first be proposed by un@@ elec@@ table Commissioners in Brussels and then be based upon a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers or , if appropriate , a unanim@@ ous amendment to the Constitution .
that is not democracy .
the un@@ democratic Constitution is , then , to be sol@@ d through an un@@ democratic distribution of funds for the purpose of providing information , so that people do not manage to dis@@ cover that , cru@@ ci@@ ally , they are los@@ ing what is at the very heart of democracy : the right to go to the po@@ lls and obtain a new majority and , subsequ@@ ently , a new policy .
whether the solution to the democratic defic@@ it is a feder@@ al b@@ ic@@ am@@ er@@ al system or , alterna@@ tively , our vision of a Europe of democra@@ cies is something that people should discuss and should decide in free and fair referendu@@ ms in all the Member States .
we rightly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elections .
should that not also apply to ourselves ?
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Barroso , we all refer frequ@@ ently to a European id@@ entity .
Mr Barroso , you in particular have spoken a great deal about it before this House .
it has to be said , however , that a European id@@ entity must be buil@@ t first and fore@@ most on common security and on the common economic area .
there can be no question of a European id@@ entity if solidarity is la@@ cking , and this lack man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ts itself every time financial decisions are taken .
I would remind you that you referred to Parliament &apos;s key role in the drawing up of financial perspec@@ tives .
I wonder what will become of financial solidarity and the foun@@ d@@ ation for the building of a European id@@ entity if Parliament &apos;s proposal is cut from EUR 1@@ 11 billion to EUR 10@@ 6 billion ?
if we wish to build a European id@@ entity in the sha@@ pe of a common area of security or a common economic area , we must be clear where the b@@ oun@@ d@@ aries li@@ e for EU enlargement .
given that Turkey &apos;s accession has been proposed , and that some@@ one might well shor@@ tly propose the accession of Moro@@ cc@@ o , whilst over@@ looking Ukraine , it is likely to become impossible to speak of a European id@@ entity , as there will be no such id@@ entity .
Mr President , I wish to focus this debate on the ongoing work of the Council to prepare and initi@@ ate the external relations service in advan@@ ce of ratification and adoption of the Constitution , for it is the Constitution which val@@ id@@ ates that service .
I have in my pos@@ session a letter from Mrs Wall@@ strö@@ m - the V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , who is present this morning - confir@@ ming that the outcome of the debate on the Constitution should neither be pres@@ u@@ med nor pre @-@ emp@@ ted in any fas@@ hi@@ on .
yet that is precisely what is being done in this ongoing work on the new external relations service .
that is wrong .
as an individual Member of this House I prote@@ st against it .
either we acknowledge and accept the right of the nation @-@ states to determin@@ e the f@@ ate of the Constitution , its new institutions and its working appar@@ a@@ tu@@ s@@ es such as the foreign service , or we do not .
both the Council and the Commission ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ tly continue to work as if the Constitution was already approved .
it is a gra@@ ve in@@ sul@@ t to and assa@@ ult on the rights of nations and indeed the rights of people .
Mr President , there can be no doubt that the Council summit of 17 December will go down as a m@@ em@@ or@@ able date in the history of the construction of Europe .
I should , however , like to tell the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council that our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlarg@@ ements , and above all about the continuing lack of respon@@ ses to the crucial question of where Europe &apos;s borders li@@ e .
we are of course in favour of Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s and Romania &apos;s accession to the EU , although these countries still need assis@@ ting in their efforts , and we are also in favour of C@@ roati@@ a &apos;s accession , as it will send a strong signal to the Balkans .
yet the situation is entirely different with regard to Turkey , a country which does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it has occu@@ pi@@ ed for 30 years .
Turkey pun@@ is@@ hes anyone who ref@@ ers to the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide , and 9@@ 7 % of its territory is outside Europe , which means that it has no right to join the European Union .
this is why we hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership put forward by France .
Turkey &apos;s integration into the EU would be tan@@ tam@@ oun@@ t to rejec@@ ting a political Europe stra@@ i@@ gh@@ ta@@ way , before it has even come into being , and to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating the im@@ age of a Europe subject to bla@@ ck@@ ma@@ il and pressure .
would this be a sensible course of action ?
moving on to another , equally important , issue , I welcomed Mr Barroso &apos;s hard @-@ h@@ it@@ ting remarks on the EU &apos;s Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
nevertheless , I remain concerned with regard to Europe &apos;s future .
without the necessary resources , the EU cannot seek to strengthen social cohesion or to support competitiveness , employment , research and environmental policy , and it will also be unable to give due consideration to the ag@@ eing of the population - in other words to ad@@ here to the Lisbon strategy - or to continue the fight against terrorism , drugs and crime .
if we continue to operate with out@@ mo@@ ded bud@@ gets , we will be unable to conf@@ ron@@ t the challenges which a@@ wait us , for example the explo@@ sive growth in C@@ hin@@ ese competition .
the Council should therefore ab@@ and@@ on its calls for a European budget set at 1 % , as otherwise Europe will no longer be able to guarantee the funding of its regional policy , which is close to the hear@@ ts of EU citizens .
we expect the Council to take into account the priorities I mentioned pre@@ viously , and then to alloc@@ ate the resources necessary to achieve our goals .
we should not forget that Europe cannot be buil@@ t without the contribution of every individual and every European citizen .
Europe should export its values to the rest of the world , but it should also respect the men and women who enable it to exist .
unfortunately , I fear that the decisions taken on 17 December will be in@@ comprehen@@ sible to many of our fellow citizens .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the Council is discussing the acc@@ es@@ sions of C@@ roati@@ a , Bulgar@@ ia , Romania and Turkey .
I should like to encourage you , when dealing with C@@ roati@@ a , to take a tou@@ gh stan@@ ce where cooperation with the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al Court is concerned , because without that cooperation , it is ir@@ responsible to make a serious start with C@@ roati@@ a .
per@@ sever@@ e !
with regard to Romania , can you guarantee that we keep the requirements for that country strict ?
that is to say : no accession as long as Romania does not meet the criteria in the areas of human rights and cor@@ ruption , among others , even if that means that Romania join@@ s the EU after Bulgar@@ ia .
I will now turn to Turkey .
would I be quo@@ ting the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Bal@@ ken@@ en@@ de , correc@@ tly if I said : no second @-@ clas@@ s status , such as a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership , and no end date ?
is that still your position now ?
are you also prepared to say : no membership at the end of the negotiations if the human rights viol@@ ations per@@ sis@@ t ?
will you apply z@@ ero toler@@ ance ?
inc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly , with regard to the sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot which we are threa@@ tening to hold today about Turkey , I am left with a feel@@ ing that this would be to dec@@ eive the public .
I hope we will not need to res@@ or@@ t to that .
over the past few months , you have held a debate about standards and values .
should you not have made this concrete by applying it , for example , to an issue such as Romania or Turkey , in the spirit of the French ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her who said : ?
why not ? otherwise , it will remain a little the@@ ore@@ tical .
does the arms embar@@ go against China not f@@ it perfectly in the framework of the debate about standards and values ?
this is not about Isla@@ m or Christi@@ an@@ ity , but about the commun@@ ality of rule of law and democracy , and in this great diversity , it is about the values we have en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in our new Constitution .
I hope that that will remain the common den@@ om@@ ina@@ tor in the debate .
I have said to you before that my impression so far of the Dutch Presidency is that its amb@@ itions and goals are not as clear as they need to be .
my question is whether that is a sign of ins@@ ec@@ urity or internal political contradic@@ tions within the Dutch Government , or are we still waiting for the big re@@ vel@@ ation ?
in that respect , the Council has qui@@ et@@ ly sa@@ d@@ d@@ led us with very th@@ or@@ n@@ y issues on a few occasions .
I will for a moment forget this meeting place , Strasbourg , but I would refer to the ine@@ fficient Treaty of Nice and the agreements sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding agricultural spending which were too expen@@ sive and produced too little change .
your amb@@ itions concerning Lisbon , Kyoto in Europe and the world are won@@ der@@ ful and we support you in them , but the financial resources you are setting asi@@ de for them are p@@ iti@@ ful .
this contradic@@ tion will , of course , not es@@ cap@@ e the public .
terrorism is once again the subject of li@@ vely debates at very high level .
only last week , all European ch@@ i@@ ef@@ s of police were ga@@ ther@@ ed here , tell@@ ing us that , due to di@@ ver@@ se national practices , the fac@@ tual exchange of information is still not getting off the ground as it should .
there is still no person in charge at the heart of Europol , terrorists are still sli@@ pp@@ ing through the net of the law and there is no harmonisation in the area of criminal investi@@ gation .
the question remains : is G@@ ij@@ s de V@@ ries to keep coas@@ ting along , or will you allow him to do his job properly ?
finally , I wish you much success with your position on Turkey .
the line I would take would be : no second @-@ clas@@ s status and no alterna@@ tives ; we are ready for real negotiations .
I hope that with this , together with Mr Bal@@ ken@@ en@@ de , you will provide Mr Poettering &apos;s group with an adequate response .
Mr President , I consider that Turkey has to begin making the necessary steps to be acceptable to join the EU .
for this purpose , certain conditions must without fail be met , one of the most important of which is the recognition of Turkey &apos;s internal pl@@ ur@@ ality .
brea@@ king the fundamental K@@ em@@ alist ta@@ bo@@ o is of vital importance .
recogn@@ ising the l@@ ing@@ uis@@ tic , cultural and political rights of K@@ ur@@ dis@@ tan and other sta@@ tel@@ ess national communities is crucial .
log@@ ically we Europeans want Turkey to comply with all of that , but we wonder whether we should not start by recogn@@ ising our own in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c pl@@ ur@@ ality .
what about all the pl@@ ur@@ i @-@ national states that keep den@@ ying their own diversity ?
in the particular case of Spain - a state that in the@@ ory acknowled@@ ges its own domestic pl@@ ur@@ ality , but not always equality among all the different nations that make up that state - still more steps have to be taken .
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Government , Mr Mi@@ gu@@ el An@@ ge@@ l Mor@@ at@@ ino@@ s , presented a m@@ em@@ or@@ an@@ du@@ m on 13 December on the official languages of the autonom@@ ous communities .
such a proposal does not imp@@ ly , as we wanted , full recognition status for Ca@@ tal@@ an , Bas@@ que and Galic@@ ian .
it does not give any recognition to A@@ stu@@ rian or Ara@@ g@@ on@@ ese .
this m@@ em@@ or@@ an@@ du@@ m off@@ ers the chance of speaking in the European Parliament in Ca@@ tal@@ an , but always at 15 days &apos; no@@ tice .
how can I han@@ dle this if I do not know until the day before if I am to be given the chance to speak ?
when your Member States &apos; governments sinc@@ er@@ ely acknowledge their pl@@ ur@@ ality , that will be the most power@@ ful too@@ l in working towards a more democratic Turkey , and in asking for a fundamental change to the way in which it is applying to join the European Union .
Mr President , my party and my political group hope that the European Council will decide to embar@@ k upon negotiations with Turkey concerning membership .
it is just as important to point out that Turkey has a very long way to go , especially when it comes to human rights , the situation regarding minorities , the Cyprus issue and union rights .
a great many legislative changes have oc@@ cur@@ red in Turkey , but it has to be realis@@ ed that these are not mat@@ ched by the reality on the ground and by changes in practice .
current Turkish legislation too is very defic@@ i@@ ent .
I can point to the new criminal law that still in practice makes it a criminal off@@ ence to mention the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide in Turkey .
that is completely unacceptable , and to Turkey &apos;s dis@@ credit that it continues to den@@ y this histor@@ ical fact .
recognition of the gen@@ oc@@ ide would open the way to nor@@ m@@ alisation for the Ar@@ men@@ ians in Turkey and also to the nor@@ m@@ alisation of relations with Ar@@ men@@ ia - something that is necessary if Turkey is to become a member of the EU .
Mr President , frequ@@ ent all@@ u@@ sions are made in this House to the continuing democ@@ rat@@ isation of Turkey , and yet we ourselves , who are sup@@ posed to vote on this issue , are taking our leave of democracy and transparency .
sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ots are generally only held in this House on matters relating to Members , and it is entirely in@@ comprehen@@ sible that such a b@@ all@@ ot should be held on important political decisions on matters of principle .
who wants to h@@ ide , and from whom ?
are they hid@@ ing from the people of the Member States , the majority of whom - on the basis of ra@@ tional argument - are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , or from the cha@@ ir@@ men of their groups , out of fear of standing up for their con@@ vic@@ tions , whatever those con@@ vic@@ tions may be ?
this would mean that this House is merely im@@ ita@@ ting the Council &apos;s behaviour , and ultimately we will fall h@@ osta@@ ge to those who say that it is too late to say no .
it is by no means too late to do so .
if Turkey were to join the EU , Europe would fall into cha@@ os .
this can be preven@@ ted if we are open and transparent in c@@ as@@ ting our &apos; no &quot; votes today .
Mr President , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , the Dutch Presidency has ne@@ arly come to an end .
it was , of course , not the easi@@ est of times to lead Europe , but we had no choice .
it already had a late start , following the rec@@ ess ; then there was the han@@ dic@@ a@@ p of a new@@ ly @-@ elected Parliament that was starting to find its fe@@ et , and that was followed by the Commission which came about in f@@ its and star@@ ts .
under this not terri@@ bly lu@@ ck@@ y sta@@ r , the Netherlands still tried to set to work .
that is why I think that the Netherlands should coun@@ t its b@@ less@@ ings , because despite the short period of time , an aw@@ ful lot got done , for example , with regard to the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme for internal security , the security of our citizens .
in that respect , Minister D@@ onn@@ er , who is so often under fir@@ e in the Netherlands , has , together with his colleagues , done an excellent job .
Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings has already said a few things about Turkey ; I do not propose to repeat them .
something I do have difficul@@ ty with and which I think mer@@ its a comment is the accep@@ tance of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia acc@@ eding .
I think that we need to let the Council , the summit , know that the matter , particularly in relation to Romania , is certainly not done and dus@@ ted , because in that country , human rights , women &apos;s rights and children &apos;s rights are still being viol@@ ated and cor@@ ruption is still ra@@ m@@ pan@@ t .
in any event , all things being equal , I do not think it is all that certain that Parliament will say &apos; yes &quot; to it .
with the same thing in mind , I should also like to make a re@@ mark about C@@ roati@@ a .
it appears that there is much more reser@@ ve with regard to that country , and I would like to ask the Dutch Presidency whether that attitude would not sti@@ f@@ le any initiatives .
finally , I turn to the Lisbon agenda , the amb@@ itions of which should , of course , be measu@@ red against the funding that is being set asi@@ de for this purpose .
in my view , at the summit , the 1 % c@@ lu@@ b should in any event ensure that the requirements for Lisbon and the question as to how social cohesion can be best achieved with the ten new Member States are examin@@ ed more effectively .
amb@@ itions and funding should ta@@ lly with each other .
Mr President , at the Council summit at the end of this week , the Dutch Presidency will present its conclusions on the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ terrorist policy and anti @-@ drugs strategy .
it is im@@ per@@ ative for the European Union &apos;s anti @-@ terrorist policy to allow cooperation to be ste@@ pped up effectively between Member States and with third countries .
in particular , we believe that Member States should enter into the necessary commitments with a view to implementing the action plan on the fight against terrorism , while s@@ tic@@ king to the timetable for that action plan , and also enter into commitments with a view to elimin@@ ating the obstacles which certain national administra@@ tions are pla@@ cing in the way of ex@@ changes of information .
we must also allow Europol and Euro@@ just to provide European added value in the fight against terrorism by pla@@ cing them at the centre of cooperation and ex@@ changes of information between Member States .
we would however note that the fight against terrorism should maintain a balance between necessary security measures , on the one hand , and respect for fundamental rights , on the other .
a political agreement on the EU &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy has already been reached within the Council , and merely needs to be adopted offici@@ ally at the Council summit on 16 @-@ 17 December .
I believe it to be unacceptable that the Council has once again failed to wait for the European Parliament &apos;s opinion , and that it ref@@ used to inform the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs of progress made in its own negotiations when the parliamentary committee was discussing the very same issue .
furthermore , we hope that a fa@@ ire@@ r approach will be adopted to issues of asylum and immigration , above all in order to ensure that the rights of every individual are respected and that responsibilities are shared .
finally , I should like to take this opportunity to express my regret at the fact that the H@@ ag@@ ue programme made no provision for measures to be taken in ins@@ tan@@ ces where Member States do not trans@@ pose legislation or instruments relating to justice and home affairs .
this is one of the short@@ com@@ ings of the most recent multi@@ annual programme .
- Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Madam V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , I would like to start by congratula@@ ting the Dutch Presidency on its work .
I have here the final draft of the conclusions and I must say that you have done a very good job .
with regard to enlargement , I wish to start by highli@@ ghting pos@@ iti@@ vely the paragrap@@ h@@ s of the conclusions relating to the im@@ min@@ ent accession of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia and to emphasise that the accession of these two countries is creating a new ge@@ opol@@ it@@ ical reality .
consequently , I consider it very important - as you mention in the conclusions - that the relevant agreements and tre@@ aties be signed early on in 2005 .
with regard to the case of Turkey , a great deal has of course been said .
I , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , will insist on keeping paragraph 20 of the draft conclusions which I have before me , because it de@@ als with the question of the peaceful resolution of differences with neighbour@@ ing countries .
I would ask you to examine very seriously the inclu@@ sion of a paragraph on Cyprus , by which I mean the with@@ dra@@ w@@ al of the Turkish forces and , of course , recognition of the Republic of Cyprus .
I would also like to make a cou@@ ple of positive remarks on what you have to say about the financial perspec@@ tives .
it is very important that we resolve the problem of the financial perspec@@ tives because , as you say , the financial perspec@@ tives and how they are addressed will give an enlarged Europe the too@@ l to deal with future challenges , and I welcome the fact that you are talking of the need for pr@@ ud@@ ence .
to close , I think that a great deal has been said about terrorism , but I wish to draw the Presidency &apos;s attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragrap@@ h@@ s .
it is a compl@@ icated issue , a very serious issue .
it is here to sta@@ y , we shall face new challenges every time and the Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission will therefore need to cooperate closely in order to combat this p@@ hen@@ omen@@ on .
Mr President , this has been a difficult year .
it started for me with a letter bom@@ b explo@@ ding in my office .
since then we have had the Mad@@ rid bom@@ b@@ ings .
I would hope that at this time of the year our thou@@ ghts are with the victims and their families .
outside the European Union there was the trag@@ edy of B@@ es@@ l@@ an , and then today &apos;s b@@ us si@@ e@@ ge in Greece .
all this reinfor@@ ces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolu@@ te priority for the EU but , as a number of colleagues have already pointed out , that needs real action .
far too often cooperation among our police , judicial and intellig@@ ence services is cooperation in name only .
even a short conver@@ sa@@ tion with any@@ body who works for Europol would reinfor@@ ce that .
Member States have to del@@ iv@@ er on their promis@@ es .
we need action , not words .
the same applies to the economic agenda .
Member States have to be called to account by the presidency for the things they have promis@@ ed to do .
in particular , we have to get much more investment into people .
we particularly need to del@@ iv@@ er on the active labour market policies that Mr W@@ i@@ m K@@ o@@ k has re@@ ported on in the past .
too many people in the European Union are in@@ active .
we are far too prepared to pay people to be on the sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p .
we need much more pro@@ active policies to make work pay , and that includes more chil@@ d@@ care and more education and training .
we cannot simply wr@@ ite people off as being un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able .
sound finan@@ ces are the basis of a good economy and therefore we are right to review the budget .
as my colleague Mrs D@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ ko@@ p D@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ ko@@ p said , it must not be some sort of ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal exercise .
we have to look at what we do .
what is the added value in doing something at European level ?
what is the best way of getting value for money for our citizens ?
at the same time , we always have to remember that solidarity is the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of the European Union .
you remove that cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one and you undermin@@ e the very foun@@ dations of the Union .
that is why this debate on finan@@ ces is vital to the future of the European Union .
I would like to comment on the accession process of two neighbour@@ ing countries .
in the case of C@@ roati@@ a , we have a well @-@ prepared nation and country with European trad@@ itions working to@@ ward ad@@ mission to the European Union .
as C@@ roati@@ ans li@@ ved under the same form of government as H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians for over 8@@ 00 years , 4@@ 00 years of which as part of the H@@ abs@@ burg Mon@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , their commitment to the legal system , and their social and economic organisation is very similar to those of H@@ un@@ g@@ ary .
I w@@ ent to Z@@ agre@@ b several times in the 199@@ 0@@ s , I have also visi@@ ted it la@@ tely , and concluded that based on their institutional prepar@@ ation on the levels of government , economy and parliament , their hop@@ es for negotiations are as justified as H@@ un@@ g@@ ary &apos;s were at the beginning of negotiations in 1998 .
C@@ roati@@ a &apos;s economic and social prepar@@ ed@@ ness also makes it possible for the negotiations for accession not only to be open@@ ed in the s@@ pring of 2005 , but also to be concluded , regar@@ d@@ less of other factors and other countries , such as Turkey .
this may also serve as a positive message to other nations and governments of the W@@ est Balkans who are head@@ ed towards Europe .
Romania &apos;s accession will be a major step in the ev@@ olution of Europe , as a European nation com@@ posed of various European peoples , including two million H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians , will join .
it will be a w@@ in @-@ w@@ in situation for both foreign policy and the internal market .
being accepted by Europe will h@@ ope@@ fully help Roman@@ ians not only to dis@@ cover the advantages of their diversity but also to preser@@ ve them , contrary to their current policies .
the preser@@ vation of European solidarity also includes pa@@ ying attention to the impact that the ex@@ pan@@ sion has on those Member States that comp@@ rise the borders of the European Union , such as Austria was this year .
a monitoring system operating on a more reg@@ ular basis , that is bi@@ ann@@ u@@ ally , needs to be established to ensure that commitments are followed through .
in the case of Romania , the functioning of the community system is of key importance , and in order to prove this , it is enough to consider environmental protection , the policy of competition or areas made v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able by internal considerations such as animal health , custom@@ s , or exc@@ ise tax .
if s@@ cre@@ ening , that involves the European Parliament , re@@ ve@@ als defic@@ its in these fields a few years before and after accession , then EU resources must be mo@@ bil@@ ised for the necessary institutional development even at the cost of other goals .
should this fail as well , then - let us face it - specific sanctions will have to be applied .
as Bulgar@@ ia ( which has shown promis@@ ing progress ) and Romania should be subject to individual consideration , I believe it is necessary to separate their accession processes and if necessary , to sti@@ pu@@ late a flexible accession date to Romania , whose membership I very much look forward to .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , as rapporteur for C@@ roati@@ a I should like to say a few words today on a country to which little reference has been made , even though it is to be hop@@ ed that the European Council summit will see a positive and important decision taken on it .
although it is a fact that every rapporteur treat@@ s the country for which he is responsible a little like his or her own child , I do believe that this is not merely a matter of taking a decision on C@@ roati@@ a , but of taking a decision on a whole region .
particularly given the stability and security concerns that have already been tou@@ ched upon , it is vital that the Council &apos;s decision on it should be fav@@ ourable .
this would be a sign that every country in the Balkans , if it makes the appropriate efforts and meet@@ s the criteria , has a chance of becoming a Member State of the European Union , something that was recently promis@@ ed in Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ik@@ i .
I believe that both the former and the present C@@ roati@@ an Govern@@ ments , with their differ@@ ing political ori@@ enta@@ tions , have done a great deal to prepare themselves and to move towards meeting the criteria to which we must pay close attention in every instance .
there is however an obsta@@ cle that is un@@ doub@@ tedly of great signific@@ ance , namely cooperation with the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al for the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via in The H@@ ag@@ ue .
it is claim@@ ed that there is such cooperation , but it has been neither full nor adequate .
demands have been made , and rightly so , that close attention be paid to whether every country - both C@@ roati@@ a and the other countries , above all Ser@@ bia - co@@ oper@@ ates with The H@@ ag@@ ue in this respect .
yet I believe that in principle , and as a matter of priority , the Council should acknowledge the positive steps undertaken by C@@ roati@@ a , and that this should also be reflec@@ ted in the Council &apos;s decision .
I also hope that the Government will not merely issue declar@@ ations , but will genuinely take every possible measure to bring the indic@@ ted general An@@ te Go@@ to@@ vina before the T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al in The H@@ ag@@ ue .
in addition to taking such measures , it should also destro@@ y the networks that perhaps still exist and support him , and it should ensure that they are genuinely destro@@ yed .
finally , Mr President , I believe that An@@ te Go@@ to@@ vina , if he is the pat@@ ri@@ ot he claim@@ s to be , should not take his country h@@ osta@@ ge .
he must give himself up to the T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al in The H@@ ag@@ ue , as it would be a real sha@@ me if the f@@ ate of a country as important as C@@ roati@@ a were to depen@@ d on the decision of a single man not to sur@@ ren@@ der to justice .
I therefore hope that , in view of all these circumstances , a positive sign will be given to The H@@ ag@@ ue .
- Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that everyone - citizens and politicians al@@ ik@@ e - is living through an historic er@@ a , because the decision which the European Council is expected to take on accession negotiations with Turkey will be a lan@@ d@@ mark for Turkey itself , the European Union and our region as a whole .
public opinion has not concerned itself to such an extent with any other candid@@ acy .
there were no such differences between the Member States or between the political parties , no such pressure was brought to bear by the United States , no such concerns or fe@@ ars were expressed , no such vari@@ ety of questions was raised so seriously at every discussion table .
the European Parliament is having tro@@ u@@ ble finding its political direction on this issue , not because of any we@@ ak@@ ness on its part , but because of the comple@@ x@@ ity and seri@@ ous@@ ness of the issue .
arguments have been expressed for and against the accession of Turkey to sa@@ tu@@ ration point over recent days .
we have one common den@@ om@@ ina@@ tor : we are calling on the European Council to defend the dignity of the European Union ; to respect Turkey , but also to respect the values which un@@ ite the peoples of Europe .
no can be used as an ali@@ b@@ i for setting asi@@ de our values or for adjus@@ ting them to Turkish demands , be it in connection with the spirit or the letter of the Copenhagen criteria or with the recognition of all 25 Member States of the European Union , by which you will understand that I mean the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus .
this is not only a mor@@ al choice , but also the best basis for a sustainable policy which will safeguard our cohesion and will ins@@ p@@ ire respect for and confidence in the Union in its citizens who , in all events , expect clear justi@@ fication for the decisions of the European Council and a public dialogue which , unfortunately , has not yet taken place , with substance and de@@ p@@ th on the future of euro @-@ Turkish relations .
the other issue I wanted to mention is that the Council should , at long last , draw up a long @-@ term plan for our foreign relations with decisi@@ veness , cohesion , properly coordin@@ ated objectives and reli@@ able financing .
in particular , I want to refer to our relations with the countries of the Balkans and our part@@ ner Mediterranean countries which make up our living space .
this framework includes the role which we need to play in the resolution of the Middle East crisis , in this new er@@ a which is at long last now starting for the region ; it would appear that the goal pos@@ ts are shi@@ f@@ ting and that there are mar@@ g@@ ins for intervention and change .
Mr President , H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian citizens voted for membership of the European Union with an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of 8@@ 3 per cent .
they did so in the beli@@ ef that after many lost dec@@ ad@@ es H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian society could become a part of the common European social model , including strong social policies for every@@ body , real improvements in environmental matters , free movement of labour and solidarity for common standards among the 25 nations .
that is the goal of this huge European project .
bes@@ ides a permanent and almost end@@ less enlargement , we should not forget the original idea of deep@@ ening the existing Union by the appro@@ xim@@ ation and harmonisation of our standards of living , infrastructure and labour market .
if we are deep@@ ly concerned about the ag@@ eing population and the lack of labour forces , why do some Member States close their labour market even to the s@@ ki@@ lled workers of other EU Member States ?
the new financial framework does not seem to answer some of the basic questions - at least as far as I am concerned .
is 1.@@ 24 per cent of the G@@ N@@ I of our Member States enough to establish a common social model for us ?
is it enough to cover the expen@@ ses of the bra@@ ve environmental initiative Na@@ tur@@ a 2000 , designed to sa@@ ve our nature and bio@@ diversity ?
if we are so pro@@ ud of our cultural values , as has been mentioned in this debate , why do we spen@@ d only one per cent of our budget on culture , education , et@@ c . ?
if 1.@@ 24 per cent of G@@ N@@ I is such a low amount to build up a common European social , environmental and cultural model , why are some Member States even considering reducing this amount ?
finally , does the Council believe in a strong social and cultural union and is it ready to provide the basic financial sources to create it ?
Mr President , the debate on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive involves many different issues .
the debate on how large the EU &apos;s income should be should never conc@@ e@@ al the importance of how we prior@@ it@@ ise our expenditure .
we must give greater priority to the expenditure supporting the development of the new knowledge @-@ based society and d@@ are to provide small@@ er subsidies to those parts of our economy that are too large and that bel@@ ong to the economy of a different er@@ a .
the Lisbon process will of course be the most important element .
what the Commission and the Council must do is not just talk about lo@@ f@@ ty goals but also propose practical measures that increase competition , especially within those sectors associated with the knowledge @-@ based society .
what is at issue is how we are to extend competition within the fields not only of education and health care but also of other areas of our society so that , in Europe , we might obtain the best businesses .
there is one issue that makes the summit we are now facing especially historic , and that is the issue of Turkey .
a &apos; no &quot; decision , or a means of dela@@ ying the membership process , would of course have consequences of various kin@@ ds .
we should in that case be lea@@ ving the field free for forces and ide@@ als other than those for which the EU stands .
the EU &apos;s basic task is to create safety and security and to br@@ id@@ ge differences instead of creating new lines of dem@@ ar@@ cation .
this means that we must ask ourselves the question : will we enjo@@ y greater safety and security with Turkey ro@@ o@@ ted firmly in the fundamental values of the EU and of Europe , just as we are that much saf@@ er and more secure as a result of the enlargement that has taken place this year and just as we shall also be saf@@ er and more secure if the EU can be extended to the Balkans ?
that issue is ultimately about the respect we perc@@ eive for the work done by the EU .
the reason why other countries want to join the EU is the EU &apos;s success in increasing safety and security .
this is an important reason why the Council must take the historic decision to agree to commen@@ cing negotiations .
in my brief contribution , I shall deal with just one to@@ pic and that is the to@@ pic of enlargement .
we have been wit@@ n@@ esses to an un@@ preced@@ ented histor@@ ical enlargement with ten new countries .
I myself come from one of the new countries and I think we can all agree that , after just the first se@@ ven months , we can say that enlargement has been a success .
it has been a success for Europe , for the &apos; old Member States &quot; and for the new countries .
the process of the historic enlargement of Europe is not complete , however .
we have tal@@ ked in this House and we shall talk again this afternoon about Romania and about Bulgar@@ ia .
I am convinced that both Bulgar@@ ia and Romania are well on the way to join@@ ing the European Union and I believe that , with the European Union &apos;s help , they will be able to make a successful accession into our Community in 2007 .
we are also going to talk about C@@ roati@@ a . C@@ roati@@ a defin@@ i@@ tely pla@@ ys a key role in the W@@ estern Balkans .
I should like the Council to give a clear signal to C@@ roati@@ a that accession talks should begin with that country , provided , of course , that the appropriate Copenhagen criteria and the requirements of the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al Court in The H@@ ag@@ ue have been met .
C@@ roati@@ a can , I believe , play a significant role in the W@@ estern Balkans and could be a future model for Ser@@ bia , Bos@@ nia , Mon@@ te@@ ne@@ gr@@ o , Maced@@ onia and the other countries of the W@@ estern Balkans .
we spoke here yesterday , and we shall again today , about Turkey .
I should like the Council to remember its obligations , to remember Europe &apos;s promis@@ es and to begin accession negotiations with Turkey .
given that we have awar@@ ded that country the status of candidate country , I feel that we o@@ we it to Turkey to open negotiations .
this will also support the process of reform there , which has been pursu@@ ed success@@ fully for the last two years .
- Mr President , there is something of which I would like to remind , our ass@@ emb@@ led Heads of State or Government , and that is that they are elected by the people .
they were elected to represent , in a European context , the interests of their people , and thus of their nation states .
they are only the first among equ@@ als , no more than that , and they bear a tre@@ mend@@ ous responsibility for our common future .
one would nor@@ m@@ ally assu@@ me that these very Heads of State or Government represent the will of the people , but , right now , that clearly seems not to be the case where exis@@ ten@@ tial questions are concerned .
let us take my own country , the F@@ eder@@ al Republic of Germany , as an example .
there has been a new sur@@ ve@@ y on the issue of Turkey .
only 15 % of Ger@@ man@@ s are in favour of Turkey ga@@ ining full membership of the European Union , 60 % of Ger@@ man@@ s support that special form of cooperation that we call a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership , 22 % are generally against cooperation between Turkey and the European Union and only 3 % expressed no opinion .
in s@@ pite of this , what our C@@ han@@ cell@@ or put to the Council was his own party @-@ political opinion .
he is the strong@@ est suppor@@ ter of Turkey &apos;s accession , of this great ma@@ d@@ ness .
is that right ?
is it responsible ?
no , it is not .
we see exactly the same situation in other Member States .
the Council must be aware that the decision now to be taken regarding the start of accession negotiations with Turkey is not just about the further enlargement of the EU .
it is an exis@@ ten@@ tial question for the European Union , for the political Union which is of the ut@@ most importance for us and for the preser@@ vation of peace in the future .
after all , our history reflec@@ ts the history of Europe , and shows how difficult it is to get along with all these small , head@@ strong European nations .
history also shows us that if we ex@@ p@@ and too much now , as did so many other former em@@ pi@@ res which gre@@ w too f@@ ast , there is the danger of our over@@ reaching ourselves and bringing about our own do@@ w@@ n@@ fall and ru@@ ination .
if our own Heads of State or Government now give Turkey a starting date for negotiations , even though the criteria have not been met , and even though we know that we cannot manage to integra@@ te this enormous country , they will be g@@ amb@@ ling away our future .
however har@@ s@@ h this might sound , Turkey is too big , too he@@ te@@ ro@@ gene@@ ous , too poor , and too pop@@ ul@@ ous .
we must not take that step .
we have ex@@ pan@@ ded much in the past year and three more countries are yet to join us .
we have to consolid@@ ate our position first .
we have to get to g@@ ri@@ ps with each other and it is the example of German re@@ uni@@ fication that shows us how difficult that task is .
we have not managed it yet .
I appeal to our Heads of State or Government to be aware that they represent the will of the people , that they have to con@@ ve@@ y the will of the people to the outside world , and that the majority of the people of Europe , I am quite convinced , think : &apos; please be careful in making promis@@ es to Turkey .
we cannot affor@@ d it ! &quot;
- Mr President , I did not actually want to speak about Turkey yet again , for everything that there is to say about it has already been said , but Mrs S@@ om@@ mer has pro@@ mp@@ ted me to speak .
everyone pres@@ ents sur@@ ve@@ ys that serve their purpose .
I know of sur@@ ve@@ ys carried out in Germany which show that people have nothing against Turkey becoming a member of the EU .
I can only say that I would war@@ n people against over @-@ dra@@ mat@@ ising and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the situation , as you have just done .
it is completely mis@@ taken and in@@ appropriate to ti@@ e Europe &apos;s existence and the sur@@ vi@@ val of the European Union to Turkey &apos;s accession .
let ten years pass and wait until the negotiations are over , and ma@@ y@@ be then Turkey will become the thir@@ tiet@@ h member of a great Union with 500 million in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants .
so please let us remain cal@@ m ; let us keep a co@@ ol head and let there be less dra@@ ma and em@@ o@@ tion in this debate .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I too actually wanted to talk about an enlarged Europe .
I wanted to congratulate you on holding a series of con@@ fer@@ ences on European id@@ entity .
that was a very good and necessary thing to do .
we have to ask ourselves what it is that hol@@ ds 4@@ 50 million Europeans together , what it is that uni@@ tes us all , from E@@ st@@ onia to Portugal , from S@@ cot@@ land to Greece , and , as we all know , the answer is : European values .
it is also the positive objectives the European Union has set itself : the commitment to peace , to freedom and to justice .
these are the things that un@@ ite us in Europe .
over the next two years in particular , during the process of rati@@ fying the Constitution , it is especially important to con@@ ve@@ y these things and not to lose ourselves in points of detail .
I am therefore especially glad that , at the summit on F@@ rid@@ ay , under Po@@ ints 6@@ 6 and 6@@ 7 of the Con@@ c@@ lu@@ sions , you asked the Commission to put these matters at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of its communication strategy .
I think that we can w@@ in the people over in this way - Commissioner Wall@@ strö@@ m is also doing good work in this regard - and so I would like to encourage you to decide in favour of this , as it is indeed necessary .
in this context , I also think that Po@@ ints 6@@ 9 and 5@@ 2 , in which we aff@@ ir@@ m human rights , are very positive .
as it has already been agreed that there should be a European Human Rights Agency , it must now be set up .
Europe needs this instrument , and our values are important not only for our id@@ entity within the Union , but also for our authority in the world at large .
I therefore wish not only to congratulate you , but also to encourage you to pus@@ h forward with these issues .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union , which has las@@ ted for several months , will shor@@ tly come to an end .
I should like to congratulate all the Members of this House , myself included , on the wide @-@ ran@@ ging nature of the debate , and to express the hope that every other important decision will be preced@@ ed by a debate of such c@@ ali@@ br@@ e .
during this debate , no fe@@ wer than four model positions on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union emer@@ ged .
the first is the traditional position , namely that negotiations should be open@@ ed , in all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ o@@ od as early as next year , with the possibility of suspen@@ ding them if it bec@@ a@@ me appar@@ ent that problems or obstacles were being created by the Turkish side .
the second position is that of opening negotiations with the possibility of offer@@ ing Turkey an alternative solution if such difficulties ar@@ ose during these negotiations , namely a special , pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership .
the third position consis@@ ts of waiting until Turkey meet@@ s the Copenhagen criteria in full , which amounts to im@@ pos@@ ing additional conditions given that the Copenhagen criteria have not been fully met .
finally , the four@@ th position is that of a special , pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership .
I understand that Parliament &apos;s decision is to adopt the first model , or in other words to start negotiations next year without any other additional conditions , and I also understand that this is likely to be the Council &apos;s decision too .
it will be a decision of ground @-@ brea@@ king importance , and a decision im@@ pos@@ ing a great responsibility on the Member States , the EU and the Council .
it will mean taking the first steps along a very deman@@ ding path .
conditions are set not only for the Turkish side , but also for the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
these conditions are all the more challeng@@ ing , and this responsibility is all the more difficult to bear , because we are , so to speak , dealing with a child .
refer@@ ences have already been made to a mar@@ ri@@ age , but I pre@@ fer to use the example of a family with an adopted child .
in a certain sense , Turkey is an adopted child , and we should not forget that the responsibilities of the family and of the par@@ ents are particularly challeng@@ ing when adopting a child .
I hope we are all fully aware of this , and that we will begin to put our European house in order .
- Mr President , of the various to@@ pic@@ s for debate at the forthcoming European Council - in addition to Turkey , which we have spoken about on a number of occasions - the to@@ pic of the fight against terrorism remains extremely important .
the Dutch Presidency &apos;s evaluation of the action programme of June 2004 is pro@@ of of this .
given that this is a threat to all of us , the most appropriate strategy is one that lead@@ s us to act together , by@@ pass@@ ing national level and even the areas of internal justice and security .
indeed , the way to deal with terrorism today is entirely different from the 197@@ 0@@ s and 8@@ 0@@ s .
the events of 11 September 2001 have us@@ her@@ ed in a ra@@ dical change in the area of security .
European countries have new responsibilities and new challenges , the urgency and seri@@ ous@@ ness of which was confirmed by 11 March .
in a glob@@ alised world , politics , diplom@@ acy , internal security and defence must be comb@@ ined to address these new types of threat .
security has become a global , in@@ div@@ isi@@ ble concept , which today en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es internal and external security and the support of third countries in the fight against terrorism .
the EU and its Member States must stre@@ am@@ line their defence capac@@ ities and strengthen their ch@@ ann@@ els of diplom@@ atic cooperation , their information services and their legal and law en@@ for@@ cement coordination , in a genuine sy@@ nergy of national and trans@@ national policy .
as a Portuguese Member of this House , I wish to point out that my government - under the then Prime Minister , Mr D@@ ur@@ ã@@ o Barroso , who is now President of the Commission - trans@@ posed all Community legislation in the area of combating terrorism and took the operational measures needed to carry this out .
on the same subject , I should like to highlight the introduction of bi@@ omet@@ ri@@ c data in pass@@ ports , a measure that was only recently adopted by Parliament .
provided it is ac@@ compan@@ ied by essential prec@@ au@@ tions , this measure will serve to strengthen crime prevention and , in turn , to reinfor@@ ce the citizens &quot; security , which is our primary objective .
on the eve of the European Council , the various speec@@ hes made in this House on this subject have shown that Parliament wishes to send out a clear message that this is the path that together we must re@@ lent@@ less@@ ly continue to follow .
as a representative of E@@ st@@ onia , her@@ self the product of the recent enlargement , I welcome the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia and Romania yesterday , and the read@@ in@@ ess to open negotiations with C@@ roati@@ a .
all the same , it is important to tre@@ at each candidate country separ@@ ately according to progress made , not as a package .
second , the principle that every EU enlargement must be balanced by a strengthening of our internal dyna@@ m@@ ics and un@@ ity is important .
as my colleague Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o said , &apos; Turkey is a special case in the enlargement . &quot;
the opening of negotiations may be san@@ c@@ tioned provided all the Copenhagen criteria are clearly met , just as in the case of accession countries in the final round of negotiations .
this is not yet the case .
a fundamental question for governments , however , is the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ va@@ bility of opening negotiations with a candidate whose military forces occ@@ up@@ y the territory of an EU Member State , and which does not even recognise the existence of that state .
this position must be made une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally clear before the negotiations start .
this is fundamental and cannot just be recommend@@ atory ; otherwise , the present ambi@@ gu@@ ity regarding the criteria will create a preced@@ ent where@@ by such ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dations in regard to large candidate countries may begin to repeat themselves .
this , however , will undermin@@ e the sense of security of other , small@@ er countries in the future .
I also call on the Commission to consider Ukraine &apos;s pros@@ pects for the future , because it is in Ukraine that the question of the EU &apos;s eas@@ tern border is being decided today .
yesterday a representative of the Ukrain@@ ian people was here - the Ukrain@@ ian Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test w@@ inn@@ er Rus@@ l@@ ana , who probably has a greater number of suppor@@ ters than any Ukrain@@ ian politic@@ ian .
her message was this : &apos; show me the room in this building where we could hand in Ukraine &apos;s accession application . &quot;
today there is no such room , but for those of us who support the democratic re@@ b@@ ir@@ th of Ukraine , it is our business to he@@ ed this message and to make sure that this room is found and made ready for use in the ne@@ ar future .
Mr President , today &apos;s debate about the European summit at the wee@@ ken@@ d has become a contin@@ uation of our discussion about Turkey , which we beg@@ an on Mon@@ day evening , and which we will bring to a conclusion immediately after this debate , when we vote on the Eur@@ l@@ ings Re@@ port .
it is a good thing that this House should de@@ vote a lot of time to the issue of Turkey &apos;s read@@ in@@ ess to join the European Union .
that is what the public ex@@ pects of this Parliament .
however , the people at home also expect us to base our debate and our decisions on a serious analysis of the facts , and it is in this regard that I have some doub@@ ts .
what has been said here today about Turkey &apos;s accession has little to do with the reality in that country .
the Dutch Presidency has expres@@ s@@ ly stated in the introduction that Turkey has fulfi@@ lled the political accession criteria , and thus is a democratic state under the rule of law , where basic rights , and especially the rights of minorities , are respected .
the President of the Commission has obviously read the most recent Commission Pro@@ g@@ ress Re@@ port more closely .
he spea@@ ks instead about the fact that Turkey meet@@ s the political criteria .
this appar@@ ently means , among other things , that tor@@ ture is no longer syste@@ ma@@ tically used in Turkish pris@@ ons , and that women can hope to one day have the same rights as men in Turkish society .
it seems that a lot of my fellow @-@ Members in this House are b@@ as@@ ing their opinions on this principle of hope - particularly all those who are to the left of centre and who , I sus@@ pect , will be in the majority .
Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z , Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , and others , have told us that a Turkey that is sec@@ ular and res@@ pects the rule of law would strengthen Europe &apos;s community of values .
that is true .
a sec@@ ular Turkey which res@@ pects the rule of law would indeed strengthen Europe &apos;s community of values .
the Turkey of today , though , is still a long way from these values .
if we do not ad@@ mit this to ourselves , we are not only being dis@@ hon@@ est with the public , but are also end@@ ang@@ ering the stability and security that has hi@@ ther@@ to been achieved in the European Union .
let us not proceed further down the road of autom@@ atic accep@@ tance of accession , or at least not where and when the facts do not really justi@@ fy it .
. Mr President , I am grateful for the remarks made by many and of which I have taken good note in prepar@@ ation for the European Council that is due to be held on Th@@ urs@@ day and F@@ rid@@ ay .
let me start with the fundamental debate raised by a number of Members of this House , that being the debate about what the European Union is , what Europe is .
I am very much at one with a number of Members , of whom Mr Wat@@ son was the first and most out@@ spoken , who state that the European Union is not a religious community .
I am also in agreement with Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , who pointed out that Europe is not a cultural community either .
as Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z and others stated , Europe , the European Union , is a community of values .
European integration is a political project rather than a religious one .
in that connection , Mrs U@@ c@@ a made the help@@ ful re@@ mark that , with Turkey in mind , that conclusion can also be a br@@ id@@ ge to Isla@@ m and indeed , we can use it to ill@@ ustra@@ te that Europe is a political and not a religious project .
conver@@ sel@@ y , Turkey can use it to demonstrate that a country that is Isla@@ mic for the most part can also be a democratic and functioning constitutional state .
some of you , including Mr Maa@@ ten and Mr L@@ eh@@ ne , have spoken in expl@@ ic@@ it terms and with appreci@@ ation about the series of con@@ fer@@ ences on the nature of Europe and the ess@@ ence of the values we share .
one of the important less@@ ons that we can draw from the discussion about European values and European id@@ entity is that we must , in fact , be careful about foc@@ using on European id@@ entity .
we all know , from the past century , what the adver@@ se effects can be of an id@@ entity that has been imposed from above .
we also realise that in terms of shared European values , many of those are , in fact , univers@@ al values , and we want them to be exactly that .
despite this , there are dis@@ cer@@ n@@ able European tra@@ its with regard to the way in which we apply those values , how we can invo@@ ke them and how we organ@@ ise them .
there are defin@@ i@@ tely specific European acc@@ ents that are ev@@ ident in those values , one important example being toler@@ ance .
this brings me to the enlargement debate , which at@@ trac@@ ted many speakers , starting with the debate about Turkey .
we held that debate yesterday and concluded that , because of the concerns about it , we will , in time , need to clearly demonstrate the huge advantages of the possibility of Turkey join@@ ing .
Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z mentioned security as one of the advantages .
Mr Wat@@ son noted that Turkey suffici@@ ently meet@@ s the criteria , and that is also , in agreement with the Commission &apos;s conclusion , the presidency &apos;s position following the entry into force of the six laws .
Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings and others pointed out once again that it is important to maintain pressure on Turkey in relation to the developments needed in that country in respect of human rights , religious freedom and other political criteria .
that is precisely why the presidency has decided , based on the Commission proposals , to come up with a new framework for future negotiations about accession .
that framework allows for more pressure to be brought to bear and off@@ ers more guarantees for smo@@ o@@ th progress .
this so @-@ called &apos; emergency stop option , &quot; in other words an option of sus@@ pension , off@@ ers guarantees in relation to the sensitive political criteria .
it is under@@ stand@@ able that a number of Members of this House should , once again , have raised the issue of Cyprus .
Mr Barroso included it in his introduction , and Mr A@@ d@@ am@@ ou and Mr D@@ im@@ it@@ ra@@ kop@@ ou@@ lo@@ s all@@ ud@@ ed to it too .
I should like to reiterate the Dutch Presidency &apos;s key position on this sc@@ or@@ e in the prepar@@ ations of the Council that will be held at the end of this week .
we do indeed want Turkey to recognise the fact that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and is one of the T@@ w@@ enty @-@ Fi@@ ve countries .
we want to bring this about by getting Turkey to sign the pro@@ tocol to the association agreement .
Mr van den Ber@@ g has asked specifically whether the presidency can confirm that the intention is that no accession date be set .
I can confirm very empha@@ tically that that is indeed the presidency &apos;s intention .
another question , related to the political criteria , was whether the presidency can confirm that Turkey will not join unless it is ready .
here too , I can defin@@ i@@ tely confirm that to be the case .
finally in connection with Turkey , I should like to raise the sensitive issue which will be discussed pres@@ ently in Parliament , namely the so @-@ called open @-@ en@@ de@@ d@@ ness of the negotiations .
once again , Mr van den Ber@@ g asked specifically what the presidency &apos;s intention is .
let me make it clear once more : the presidency &apos;s intention is that these should be accession negotiations with accession in mind .
that is my first point .
my second is that , following on from the Commission &apos;s comments , it is an open @-@ en@@ ded process .
there is no guarantee as to the outcome . the third element is that European cohesion must in any event remain suffici@@ ently guaranteed , but the Dutch Presidency &apos;s understanding for Th@@ urs@@ day &apos;s and F@@ rid@@ ay &apos;s conclusions is that there is indeed no P@@ l@@ an B .
since we will be discussing Romania and Bulgar@@ ia later on , I will now con@@ fine myself to a few fundamental remarks in response to questions in this respect .
Mr Wat@@ son and Mr B@@ ec@@ se@@ y , among others , have ins@@ is@@ ted on a separate approach for Bulgar@@ ia on the one hand and Romania on the other .
in that connection , it is useful to point out that , as you know , no distinc@@ tion can be drawn in the agreement , but one can , if necessary , be drawn with regard to the date of accession , because the option has been introduced and agreed , if there is cause for this , to decide to suspen@@ d accession of the country in question for one year at most .
that is also the response to the questions by Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings , Mrs O@@ omen @-@ Ru@@ ij@@ ten and Mr K@@ ir@@ k@@ hope , who are still deep@@ ly concerned about the situation in Romania and emphasise the importance of continuing to bring maximum pressure to bear on the developments there .
I share that view , and that is why we in the Presidency have proposed that the Council should conclude that we want additional provisions in terms of monitoring and specific ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks for Romania , cou@@ pl@@ ed with a potential san@@ ction , if necessary , of one year &apos;s sus@@ pension .
a number of Members have made reference to C@@ roati@@ a , and , as it is not a separate item on the agenda , I think that , despite the u@@ pro@@ ar in the Chamber , it would be useful to give you a precise response to this .
Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o and Mr B@@ ec@@ se@@ y have indicated that C@@ roati@@ a has made much progress in moving closer to Europe , and that it is a European country .
I should like to empha@@ tically endorse both of these statements .
much progress has been made and the country is loc@@ ated in the centre of Europe .
in addition , Mr Wat@@ son , Mr van den Ber@@ g and Mr Sw@@ ob@@ o@@ da were right to point out that full cooperation with the IC@@ T@@ Y ( International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ e for the F@@ orm@@ er Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via ) is of vital importance .
I would say to Mr Sw@@ ob@@ o@@ da and to Mr B@@ ec@@ se@@ y that it would , of course , be good if we could make that positive step , also be@@ aring in mind the ful@@ fil@@ ment of C@@ roati@@ a &apos;s role as a model in the Balkans .
I agree with Mr Sw@@ ob@@ o@@ da that we must try to have a positive decision .
that is the presidency &apos;s commitment and that means that indeed , we can decide in favour of opening negotiations at the beginning of next year , provided that these are specifically linked to full cooperation with the IC@@ T@@ Y .
another important point that many of you have raised is that of combating terrorism , the major signific@@ ance of which has also been under@@ lined by President Barroso and Mr P@@ in@@ he@@ ir@@ o , among others .
in addition , Mr Wat@@ son , Mrs Mal@@ m@@ strö@@ m and Mrs Bu@@ i@@ ten@@ we@@ g were right , in my view , to point out the importance of strik@@ ing a balance between fighting terrorism and fundamental rights .
I agree with them , and I think that Mr Ma@@ ar@@ ten was right to point out that we , in the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme , have demonstrated the Council &apos;s desire to preser@@ ve that balance .
Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings specifically asked about ways of bann@@ ing organisations .
he will be aware that that is a responsibility , a competence , of the Member States , but we will defin@@ i@@ tely ensure that information about it is ex@@ changed between them .
Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings , and others , see the exchange of information as crucial to the fight against terrorism .
that is the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of this presidency , and is also included in the Council &apos;s agenda for Th@@ urs@@ day and F@@ rid@@ ay .
over these past six months , we have made concrete progress in making it easier to exchange criminal recor@@ ds , coll@@ ating intellig@@ ence and in relation to situation c@@ ent@@ res and threat analys@@ es that can be carried out in those c@@ ent@@ res .
as you know , we will be asking the Commission to table a more detailed proposal for the exchange of information , as provided for in the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme .
at the request of a number of Members , I am happy to inform you specifically of the European Council &apos;s intention , next Th@@ urs@@ day and F@@ rid@@ ay , to decide whether , in principle , to ap@@ point a European human rights amb@@ assa@@ d@@ or .
many in this House spoke about the financial perspective .
in his introduc@@ tory remarks , Mr Barroso mentioned the importance of added value where the mul@@ ti @-@ annual budget and budget dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine are concerned , and he had good reason to do so , but he also expressed his concern , which was subsequ@@ ently given greater emphasis by others , about the 1 % approach and the importance of sufficient funding for Europe &apos;s priorities .
it is therefore useful to indic@@ ate the Council &apos;s position on this sc@@ or@@ e .
we sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to many of the priorities mentioned here , but it remains important in every financial discussion , in addition to the priorities , to determin@@ e the pos@@ teri@@ orities , and not only coun@@ t the priorities .
that is exactly what we in the Presidency have done with what we call our &apos; building b@@ loc@@ ks &quot; approach , in which we have tried to draft a sum@@ mar@@ y and comp@@ ile pos@@ teri@@ orities rather than only priorities .
I can reas@@ sure a number of Members who are wor@@ ried about what is going to happen on Th@@ urs@@ day and F@@ rid@@ ay .
Mrs G@@ ros@@ s@@ et@@ ê@@ te fe@@ ared that we would be taking a decision about 1 % which would not be understood by the citizens .
the Council has not adopted a position on the 1 % , let that be very clear .
based on the Commission proposals , which are still the guid@@ ing principle - because , after all , the new Parliament quite rightly values them gre@@ atly - the Council has simply out@@ lined the positions of the Member States , both priorities and pos@@ teri@@ orities , and it is on those that we will be b@@ as@@ ing our decisions .
I am keen to conc@@ ur with Mr Wat@@ son in his concerns about the financial accoun@@ tability and his concern about the fact that , for the ten@@ th time now , the Court of Auditors has not issu@@ ed a Sta@@ te@@ ment of As@@ surance about expenditure .
during our presidency , we have taken steps to improve that situation by means of single a@@ ud@@ its , and we will discuss this in more detail in the s@@ pring .
as far as the EU &apos;s external policy is concerned , I think we have experienc@@ ed a historic moment , one that was mentioned by many .
Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z was the first one to speak about it , and was very fran@@ k , as was Mrs Na@@ pol@@ e@@ tan@@ o .
that moment had to do with Ukraine .
I think that the stan@@ ce that we - the European Parliament , the Commission and Council - have taken has demonstrated our ability to speak with one voice where external policy is concerned .
in my view , that is a very important step in the progress we managed to bring about in the democ@@ rat@@ isation process in Ukraine .
it is also a very important step to@@ ward speaking with one voice in external policy .
that is a first step and we intend to take more of them on the basis of the new Treaty .
I can be brief about the next subject , namely the Lisbon strategy , which was raised by a number of Members , including Mr Maa@@ ten , Mr K@@ ir@@ k@@ hope and Mr T@@ it@@ le@@ y .
you know that this subject is not on this Council &apos;s agenda , as it will be raised in the s@@ pring .
however , we will per@@ sever@@ e , and it is true that the implementation of the Lisbon strategy is one of the key com@@ pon@@ ents .
as Mr Maa@@ ten and Mr K@@ ir@@ k@@ hope stated , it is also true that der@@ e@@ gulation and the reduction of the administrative burden is crucial for our competitiveness in the world .
I turn , finally , to the issue of public involvement and the importance of transparency and op@@ enn@@ ess .
what I should like to say to Mrs Bu@@ i@@ ten@@ we@@ g with regard to op@@ enn@@ ess is that we have , during our presidency , tried to create more op@@ enn@@ ess in the Council meetings wh@@ er@@ ever possible .
in addition , a uni@@ que meeting took place in Amster@@ dam involving all European Affairs ministers .
the whole of this meeting was public , as was an infor@@ mal industrial meeting .
I should like to end on an optimis@@ tic note .
Mr Maa@@ ten congratula@@ ted the presidency on promoting the public &apos;s involvement by means of good communication .
I am not certain whether it has anything to do with that , but according to the latest Euro@@ bar@@ om@@ e@@ ter sur@@ ve@@ y , there is an increase in the public &apos;s positive involvement .
the perc@@ enta@@ ge of citizens who say that EU membership is a good thing has ris@@ en from 48 % to 5@@ 6 % .
that is not enough , but is nevertheless a big step forward and I should like to end on this happy note .
in any case , I would like to thank you for your attention .
Mr President , on behalf of President Barroso and the whole of the Commission , I wish to thank you for this debate , which has provided us with many valuable and constructive proposals and vie@@ w@@ points .
the debate has also reflec@@ ted the EU &apos;s ambitious and deman@@ ding agenda over the next few years .
I have only one single thing to add to what has already been said by President Barroso and the Presidency of the Council .
this has to do with an aspect of the Commission &apos;s proposal concerning Turkey .
par@@ all@@ el to the negotiations on which the Commission wishes to embar@@ k with Turkey , a cultural dialogue is also proposed .
this will serve as a chan@@ nel for the an@@ xi@@ ety and pre@@ jud@@ ices that are to be found , as well as for the real differences that exist between the EU and Turkey , and will ensure that we can overcome all these by embar@@ king upon a bilateral dialogue in civil society too .
that is something I believe is very important if we are also to investi@@ g@@ ate and resolve a number of the arguments put forward in this House .
these often have to do with a fear of what is vie@@ wed as un@@ known or fri@@ gh@@ tening .
remember that such fear is felt on both sides .
I believe this to be an important instrument in the dialogue .
the concerns in question are of course of ten years &quot; du@@ ration when it comes to the issue of Turkey .
it is also important to ask ourselves some fundamental questions in the run @-@ up to this important decision .
what is it that can bring about the strong@@ est forces in favour of a sec@@ ular Turkey character@@ ised by legal certainty ?
what would be the risks and the effects of sig@@ n@@ all@@ ing a change to the EU &apos;s political direction when it comes to embar@@ king upon negotiations with Turkey ?
I hope , indeed am convinced , that the debate that has been conduc@@ ted in this House today will be a sound basis for the discussions that are to be conduc@@ ted by the Council and that will continue to be conduc@@ ted in the Commission too .
the debate is closed .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
the next item is the vote .
Mr Wat@@ son has the floor for a point of order .
which Rule of Procedure are you invo@@ king , Mr Wat@@ son ?
Mr President , I rise because in ten years of service in this House I cannot rec@@ all an instance similar to that regarding today &apos;s vote on the Eur@@ l@@ ings report ...
I would ask you to o@@ be@@ y the Rules of Procedure and indic@@ ate which Rule you are invo@@ king .
I a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise , Mr President , I should like to make a point of order under Rule 16@@ 2 .
as I was saying , in ten years &apos; service I cannot rec@@ all a similar instance to that with which we are faced today .
we consisten@@ tly demand of the Council and the Commission op@@ enn@@ ess and transparency in political decisions ...
... and it is an extra@@ ordinary practice for Members of this House to ask for a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot on a political decision under Rule 16@@ 2 , which is designed for the ap@@ poin@@ tment of individuals .
how can we be accoun@@ table to our elec@@ tors ?
how can we defend ourselves against char@@ ges of sha@@ me and hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y ?
Mr President , I urge you to face down this ra@@ m@@ sha@@ ck@@ le co@@ al@@ ition of co@@ wards and au@@ to@@ c@@ rats , ...
... to dec@@ l@@ are a sec@@ ret vote in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sible on the grounds that it is un@@ wor@@ thy of this House and to seek an early change to the Rules of Procedure to clarify this Rule .
Mr President , I have ris@@ en to speak on the basis of Rule 16@@ 2 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of our Rules of Procedure .
as Mr Wat@@ son has just pointed out , and to pic@@ k up on the remarks made by Mr Poettering , it is the European Union &apos;s duty to take the historic decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey .
there are those who are opposed to Turkey &apos;s accession , and I have great respect for these people .
there are also those who are in favour of such an accession , and I have great respect for them too .
yet I know of no one whom I respect who la@@ cks the courage to say what they think about Turkey .
I would ask Mr Poettering to make a public statement on whether he is for or against the sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot which will take place in this House today .
is he personally for or against the sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot ?
Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , you may ask the honourable Members to cal@@ m down , but I must remind you that you are speaking on a point of order .
so please restric@@ t y@@ our@@ self to that .
I would ask that those Members who have signed this resolution with the far right to with@@ draw their sig@@ na@@ tures , as the resolution is bene@@ ath their lo@@ gic and their intellig@@ ence .
I call on all those with any self @-@ respect to with@@ draw their sig@@ na@@ tures and to vote ...
Mr President , we are fam@@ ili@@ ar with Rule 16@@ 2 , and we also see from the voting list that 14@@ 7 Members are appar@@ ently invo@@ king Rule 16@@ 2 to justi@@ fy holding a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot on various tabled amendments and in the final vote .
I would therefore like to make my group &apos;s position on Rule 16@@ 2 clear : the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament would pre@@ fer a vote by ro@@ l@@ l call , for we believe that Europe &apos;s citizens have a right to know how Members of the European Parliament are voting on this key issue .
in our view , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in this House is inc@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of ad@@ her@@ ing to a coherent and uni@@ fied line .
most of the 14@@ 7 sig@@ na@@ tures come from this group , and I would like to thank the former Belgian Prime Minister , Mr D@@ e@@ ha@@ ene , for infor@@ ming the Members of this group in une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cal terms that while this solution may be acceptable from a legal perspective , politically it is completely unacceptable .
it is becoming clear that the point of order relates to the application of Rule 16@@ 2 on sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ots , in accordance with the request made .
Mr President , firstly , this is one Rule that I did not draft .
secondly , let me under@@ line - before you make your r@@ ul@@ ing - the signific@@ ance of the word &apos; may &apos; .
rule 16@@ 2 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure says that voting &apos; may &apos; also take place by sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot , if requested by at least one @-@ fif@@ th of the Members .
it does not say &apos; shall &apos; .
the previous paragraph says &apos; shall &apos; concerning voting on n@@ omin@@ ations of individuals .
there is a clear difference between the two cases of &apos; may &apos; and &apos; shall &apos; ...
Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t , we must respect the Rules of Procedure .
I realise that you are extremely know@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able on the subject , but I have not asked you for advice .
I take good note of your opinion and I will take it into account .
ladies and gentlemen , please only raise genuine points of order .
otherwise , this debate will go on fore@@ ver .
Mr President , without wis@@ hing to offer un@@ wanted advice , I should like to make a sugges@@ tion , namely , that the request made by a number of Members be put to the House .
Parliament would then be able to decide whether or not it is in favour of holding a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot .
you have made a proposal to organ@@ ise our work .
the Presidency takes good note of that , but our work is regula@@ ted by the Rules of Procedure and they provide us with sufficient guid@@ ance on how to proceed .
Mr President , I just wanted to say that according to my reason - if not to the Rules of Procedure - I am against the sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot and ask colleagues from my Group - or some of them at least - to with@@ draw their sig@@ na@@ tures .
ladies and gentlemen , this is not a debate on whether those who have signed have been right to do so or whether they should not sign .
I am only giving the floor for points of order and I would ask you to respect that .
opinions on whether it is good or bad to sign or not to sign , on whether Members should vote one way or another , may be very interesting , but they have no place at this point in the procedure .
accord@@ ingly , if a point of order tur@@ ns out not to be one , the President will cut off the speak@@ er .
- Mr President , I do not intend to take your job from you or to give you advice .
however , even if a request for a vote by ro@@ l@@ l call has been made , under Rule 16@@ 2 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure the request for a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot shall take priority over the request for a vote by ro@@ l@@ l call .
Mr President , all that I am asking is for you to implement the provisions of Rule 16@@ 2 ( 3 ) , under which one fif@@ th of Members of Parliament may call for a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot .
I should like to remind Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament , and you , Mr President , that the aim of this is to safeguard our ut@@ most priority , namely freedom of con@@ sci@@ ence and expression .
the debate , Mr President ...
Mr President , I invo@@ ke the same ar@@ ticle as Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z .
the right to a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot is a traditional minority right which I defend , although I make no sec@@ ret of the fact that I am voting against Turkey &apos;s accession .
it has become perfectly clear that these are not points of order , but rather explan@@ ations of the att@@ it@@ ud@@ es of each Member towards the issue we are dealing with and I therefore see no need or reason to continue giving the floor for points of order .
nevertheless , we must organ@@ ise our work and we must , of course , do so in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , which sometimes l@@ end themselves to interpre@@ tations that must be clari@@ fied , as in this case .
the Presidency has received three requests for sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ots presented in accordance with Rule 16@@ 2 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure , which says , and I quo@@ te - I will do so in Spanish and naturally it will have to be trans@@ la@@ ted : &apos; voting may also be by sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot if requested by at least one @-@ fif@@ th of the com@@ pon@@ ent Members of Parliament .
such requests must be made before voting beg@@ ins . &quot;
with regard to the application of this provision , in this case , having heard those Members who have spoken under the gu@@ ise of points of order and naturally having s@@ ought the opinion and the advice of the legal services of the House and the General Secre@@ tari@@ at , which I am obliged to do , I can tell you the following : firstly , that the competent services have confirmed to me that these requests have been endor@@ sed by a sufficient number of Members and that they have in fact been presented on time .
secondly , we have the issue , that some of you have raised , of the interpre@@ tation of whether or not we are obliged to hold a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot , since Rule 16@@ 2 ( 2 ) , which has been mentioned so often this morning , says that &apos; voting may also be by sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot &quot; rather than &apos; voting will also be . &quot;
there is , therefore , room for interpre@@ tation of what the Rules of Procedure say .
furthermore , the Court of F@@ ir@@ st In@@ stan@@ ce of the European Commun@@ ities issu@@ ed a judg@@ ment in October 2001 in which it also interpre@@ ted the term &apos; may &quot; or &apos; can &quot; as an obli@@ g@@ atory condition in relation to a Rule of Procedure similar to the one we are dealing with now .
in accordance with these preced@@ ents and regar@@ d@@ less - I would insist - of the opinions of any particular person on whether matters should be done one way or another , the Presidency believes that , since a request has been presented on time and correc@@ tly , we must proceed to a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot ...
... although this issue , for future occasions , must be considered by Parliament &apos;s committee responsible for issues relating to Rules of Procedure .
we shall probably have to clarify in the future whether or not the Presidency &apos;s interpre@@ tation is correct , but at this point in the procedure , the Presidency must take responsibility for the decision without having the opportunity to take the advice of the competent committees , and it is my feel@@ ing , having heard all the Members and the legal services , that according to a correct interpre@@ tation of the Rules of Procedure we must proceed to the sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot requested , and that is what we are going to do .
with regard to how the vote will be taken , I must inform the honourable Members that I have decided that we shall use the electronic procedure in accordance with Rule 16@@ 1 ( 1 ) and there is , therefore , no reason to desig@@ n@@ ate a coll@@ e@@ ge of tell@@ ers .
it shall be sec@@ ret , but electronic .
having said that , we shall begin the votes .
Mr President , I should like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 7@@ 1 , as it men@@ tions certain facts with which not everyone is fam@@ ili@@ ar .
on behalf of my group , I should like to suggest re@@ pla@@ cing the ph@@ r@@ ase &apos; the re @-@ opening to pil@@ gr@@ im@@ s of the Ar@@ men@@ ian Na@@ tional Ma@@ us@@ ole@@ um in nor@@ thern An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia &quot; - in which the word &apos; ma@@ us@@ ole@@ um &quot; is an in@@ acc@@ ura@@ te trans@@ lation - with the ph@@ r@@ ase &apos; the re @-@ opening to pil@@ gr@@ im@@ s of the ru@@ ined Ar@@ men@@ ian ch@@ ur@@ ches of A@@ n@@ i , ne@@ ar K@@ ars in E@@ as@@ tern An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia . &quot;
n@@ one of our Ar@@ men@@ ian friends were aware of this place or of its opening to pil@@ gr@@ im@@ s .
the same can be said for the second oral amendment I would like to propose .
there is doubt as to whether Turkish histor@@ i@@ ans are in fact keen to carry out research into the gen@@ oc@@ ide , and I therefore propose remo@@ ving the reference to &apos; Turkish histor@@ i@@ ans &quot; in the plu@@ ral , and merely including the name of the head of their scho@@ ol , or &apos; H@@ al@@ il Ber@@ k@@ ta@@ y , &quot; the Turkish histor@@ ian who has done a great deal to further our knowledge of the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide .
ladies and gentlemen , many of you have said that you were un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar with this name , and that the amendment was out of place , but you should now be aware that it is a reference to H@@ al@@ il Ber@@ k@@ ta@@ y .
the rest is to remain un@@ changed , as these were merely clari@@ fications .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , vehic@@ le the@@ ft is on the rise in Europe , as is a feel@@ ing of ins@@ ec@@ urity among our citizens .
Europol tell@@ s us that of the 1 million @-@ plu@@ s c@@ ars st@@ olen in 2002 , fe@@ wer than 39 % were rec@@ over@@ ed .
in Parliament we have adopted and recommend@@ ed various measures .
we did this as recently as March and I congratulate the Council for finally implementing some of them .
better late than never . the proposal submitted to us by the Netherlands is well inten@@ tioned but in the wrong form .
the text submitted to us should have fall@@ en under the scope of the first pillar and not the third .
the Commission up@@ held our arguments in this regard .
some people in this House felt that it should be rejected for this reason .
we saw it differ@@ ently in the C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Committee .
we have remo@@ ved from the text anything that should exclu@@ sively fall under the Community pillar and included anything that could be covered by the inter@@ governmental pillar .
Mr President , we have proved that Parliament has ac@@ ted in good fa@@ it@@ h and is sensitive to the growing problem of c@@ ar the@@ ft and the crimin@@ ality that goes with it .
we should like to give one message to the Council : it would be good if , in the future , the Council and the Member States show@@ ed greater respect for Parliament &apos;s pr@@ er@@ og@@ atives .
one last word to thank all those Members of this House who contribu@@ ted with proposals and advice , in particular the Members of the Transport Committee and Mr J@@ ar@@ di@@ m F@@ er@@ n@@ an@@ des and Mrs Wor@@ t@@ man@@ n @-@ K@@ o@@ ol .
Mr President , our oral Amendment No 28 is intended to provide better and more effective protection for the rights we intend to protect and to do so in a realistic manner , not through u@@ to@@ pian proposals .
for the sa@@ ke of realis@@ m , based on experience , what we are asking , Mr President , is that the expression &apos; in the applic@@ ant &apos;s own language &quot; be re@@ placed with the expression &apos; a language comprehen@@ sible to the applic@@ ant . &quot;
Mr President , in order not to be ti@@ res@@ ome , I will simply say that my arguments are the same as those I put forward in defence of oral Amendment No 28 .
- Mr President , it is with great ple@@ asure that I give an explanation of my vote on the report on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
I shall start by saying that I voted against Turkey join@@ ing the European Union , but I should like to explain how I arri@@ ved at that decision .
last week , on 9 December , I found myself in Re@@ g@@ gi@@ o C@@ al@@ ab@@ ria , where I had been invi@@ ted by the P@@ en@@ sioners &quot; Party official Car@@ l@@ o Ro@@ si@@ tani to give a lec@@ ture at the T@@ om@@ mas@@ o Gu@@ ll@@ i T@@ e@@ ac@@ her Tra@@ ining C@@ olle@@ ge .
I asked a clas@@ s of about 1@@ 20 g@@ ir@@ ls aged between 16 and 19 to vote for or against Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
the b@@ all@@ ot of these 1@@ 20 youn@@ g@@ s@@ ters gave the following result : 100 g@@ ir@@ ls out of 1@@ 20 voted against accession while the other 20 ab@@ sta@@ ined .
I have therefore will@@ ingly gone along with those young people &apos;s vote .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey .
this is a matter of principle for me .
the European Union , foun@@ ded in R@@ ome in 19@@ 5@@ 7 , has always defined itself in Christian and democratic terms , based on Greek ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y , R@@ oman law and Christian fa@@ it@@ h .
as a result of today &apos;s prof@@ oun@@ dly mis@@ guid@@ ed decision by the European Parliament , we are ab@@ an@@ don@@ ing this spirit of R@@ ome .
the former French President , G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing , is quite right : it would indeed be the end of the EU as we know it .
may G@@ od protect the W@@ est &apos;s Christian civil@@ isation .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report on Turkey and I believe we did good work today .
we have given encoura@@ g@@ ement to those in@@ side Turkey and indeed to those outside Turkey who have campa@@ ig@@ ned and worked hard for a sec@@ ular Turkish state , a Turkish state based on democracy and a Turkish state that res@@ pects human rights .
we have also sent a strong message to the 15 million Mus@@ lim@@ s who already live in@@ side the European Union that this is not an exclu@@ sive Christian c@@ lu@@ b .
so all in all I am very pleased with the work we have carried out this morning .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to remind all Members of this House , both those who voted for and those who voted against , that the vote was not on whether Turkey should be accepted into the European Union or not .
this may well be a good thing .
what Parliament has done is to vote in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey .
whether Turkey join@@ s the European Union or not will depen@@ d on the course of these negotiations and on their outcome .
it is my impression that there are still Members of the House who are not aware of this .
- Mr President , I am opposed to Parliament &apos;s decision to begin negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession , because Turkey is not Europe !
in addition , we are running the risk of one day seeing a fla@@ g f@@ lying over these institutions - the Turkish fla@@ g - which is still sta@@ ined with the blood of the Ar@@ men@@ ian people , whose hol@@ oc@@ a@@ ust is not recognised by Turkey .
we have bet@@ ra@@ yed the spirit of Le@@ pan@@ to , a thou@@ s@@ and @-@ year tradition of a Europe that is and wants to remain atta@@ ched to its Christian ro@@ ots .
Turkish society , moreover , is still closely ti@@ ed to the principles of Isla@@ mic fundamentalis@@ m , and that is a gra@@ ve danger of which Europe should be more aware .
we are therefore pro@@ ud to have voted against starting the procedures for Turkey to join Europe , and we consider that those European politicians who ir@@ respon@@ sibly supported that decision should be as@@ ha@@ med of themselves , because the decision goes against the wishes of the majority of the people .
we call for a referendum to be held in all the countries of the European Union so that the people can have their say , because the peoples of Europe are against Turkey &apos;s accession .
Mr President , in of 8 December , Mr E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an , the Turkish Prime Minister , stated that if the EU is not a Christian c@@ lu@@ b , then it should be possible for an Isla@@ mic country such as Turkey to join .
what this means is that Europe should ab@@ and@@ on its individu@@ ality , or a large propor@@ tion of it any@@ way , while Turkey is allowed to sta@@ y an Isla@@ mic c@@ lu@@ b .
a few days later , Mr E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an , in al@@ er@@ ted the European leaders to the fact that violence from Isla@@ mic extre@@ mis@@ ts could es@@ cal@@ ate if Europe re@@ jects Turkey as a candidate country .
since Mr E@@ r@@ do@@ g@@ an is himself from that back@@ ground , we can consider this as a do@@ w@@ n@@ right threat , as bla@@ ck@@ ma@@ il , pur@@ e and simple .
we in the European Parliament no longer even have the self @-@ respect to act against that kind of bla@@ ck@@ ma@@ il .
moreover , how will we in future reject appl@@ ications from Moro@@ cc@@ o , for example , if we include a non @-@ European country such as Turkey ?
the public is being taken for a r@@ ide ; we are told that Turkey is being assess@@ ed according to the Copenhagen criteria , but that does not appear to be the case .
it is not a problem that in Turkey , tor@@ ture is being carried out on a mas@@ sive scale , that Turkey has its tro@@ op@@ s occ@@ up@@ ying part of the territory of an existing Member State and even ref@@ uses to recognise that state .
I can only conclude that we in this House have become too pu@@ si@@ ll@@ an@@ im@@ ous to carry on protecting our own interests as Europeans .
Mr President , let me focus on the positive aspects first .
we have inten@@ si@@ fied our conf@@ ron@@ tation course on human rights issues - which is direc@@ ted against the Turkish Government , not the Turkish people - by calling for rights and freedoms for the K@@ ur@@ ds and for the gen@@ oc@@ ide per@@ pet@@ ra@@ ted against the Ar@@ men@@ ians to be acknowled@@ ged and properly examin@@ ed .
another positive point is that we have not deman@@ ded Turkey &apos;s accession , but merely the opening of accession negotiations , which I voted against .
given that the Members who are in favour of accession negotiations include many who are ultimately opposed to accession , we appear to be on the right tra@@ ck .
we were in the minority at first , but our course is now endor@@ sed by the larg@@ est group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and we just need another 40 Members to adopt a clear position over the coming years .
there will then be no majority in this House in favour of Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union when we finally take a binding vote on this issue .
that apart , it is a matter for the PPE @-@ DE Heads of Government , at the Brussels summit in two days &apos; time , to stop the on@@ ward sur@@ ge of the lem@@ min@@ gs , which ine@@ vi@@ tably ends in disaster .
.
our Europe is an open Europe , foun@@ ded on the European public culture der@@ iv@@ ed from our common values and standards .
this &apos; un@@ ity in diversity &quot; is both Europe &apos;s most important character@@ is@@ tic and its greatest ass@@ et .
the impl@@ ication of such a political project is that there are limits .
the Union &apos;s further enlargement should not stand in the way of its becoming even deep@@ er .
after all , Turkish membership threa@@ ten@@ s to turn the Union into a merely economic co@@ oper@@ ative which will no longer be able to carry out important sup@@ ran@@ ational responsibilities in a coordin@@ ated manner .
a Union de@@ vo@@ id of any streng@@ th and spirit , par@@ al@@ ys@@ ed by internal contradic@@ tions ; that is not the outcome for which many had worked and about which they had dre@@ am@@ ed .
there is no doubt that Turkey has made an important jour@@ ne@@ y over the past few years .
these reforms and in @-@ de@@ p@@ th economic cooperation must defin@@ i@@ tely be continued .
in this respect , a special partnership between the Union and Turkey seems to be the appropriate rou@@ te , in which , al@@ ong@@ side far @-@ reaching economic cooperation , conditions can also be agreed in the areas of the K@@ ur@@ ds , women &apos;s rights and human rights in general .
since this latter element is not provided for in the report , I shall be voting against the report and the resolution .
.
although the Commission &apos;s report was well @-@ foun@@ ded , its recommendations of 6 October no longer required Turkey to recognise the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide of 19@@ 15 .
this gen@@ oc@@ ide resul@@ ted in the death of over one million people , which was e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to ne@@ arly two thir@@ ds of the country &apos;s larg@@ est minority .
this crime , which was carried out with inten@@ t and which led to wid@@ es@@ pread and syste@@ matic destruction , was the first gen@@ oc@@ ide of the tw@@ en@@ tiet@@ h century , and yet even today the Turkish State continues to op@@ pose refer@@ ences to it .
the wor@@ st possible course of action now would be to remain sil@@ ent .
the Commission &apos;s sil@@ ence could lead one to think that this trag@@ edy does not concern it in any way , and that it is a problem for Tur@@ ks and Ar@@ men@@ ians alone .
this is something I find d@@ istu@@ r@@ b@@ ing , not for reasons of religi@@ on , history or community , but because this is a political issue which has direct be@@ aring on democracy and human rights .
this is an issue which goes back to the very foun@@ dations of the European Union , laid after the Sec@@ ond World W@@ ar when France and Germany aff@@ ir@@ med their desire to bring peace to Europe .
this meant that our continent &apos;s most tragic hours were overcome , even though the full extent of the ex@@ termin@@ ation of J@@ e@@ ws would not be fully acknowled@@ ged until later .
this is why the Ar@@ men@@ ian issue is crucial for a Europe seeking to become an area of freedom and anti @-@ tota@@ li@@ tari@@ an@@ ism where a modern and sec@@ ular citiz@@ en@@ ship f@@ lou@@ ris@@ hes .
.
I ab@@ sta@@ ined from voting on the European Commission &apos;s 2004 reg@@ ular report and recommendations on Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession for the following reasons .
I believe that the European Union &apos;s in@@ ability to for@@ mu@@ late , approve and construc@@ t a coherent political project is a major obsta@@ cle to the wel@@ coming of Turkey into the Community .
it appears to me to be ques@@ tion@@ able , if not ir@@ responsible , to pursue a policy of never @-@ ending enlargement at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and its social and tax harmonisation are far from a reality .
at present , the European Union is not in a position to make political proposals of genuine integration to a country the siz@@ e of Turkey .
I would note that our position is not based on arguments relating to ge@@ ograph@@ ical , histor@@ ical , religious or cultural aspects .
it is not Turkey &apos;s ability to meet a certain number of conditions which has caused me to hold such a view , but the European Union &apos;s in@@ ability to provide the necessary framework to create a common future .
. - O@@ n behalf of the C@@ S@@ U Members of the European Parliament , I would like to clarify our position in relation to the possible opening of accession negotiations with Turkey once more .
today &apos;s vote has shown that the &apos; pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership &apos; model is endor@@ sed by many of our fellow Members from all EU Member States and all political groups .
this refu@@ tes the arguments , in particular , of those who claim that the C@@ D@@ U and the C@@ S@@ U are is@@ ol@@ ated on this issue in Europe .
I hope that the European Council will also take this into account at its deliber@@ ations on F@@ rid@@ ay .
we continue to take the view that the European Union &apos;s record of success would be mas@@ sively je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed by Turkish accession .
anyone wan@@ ting Europe to de@@ gener@@ ate into a free @-@ trade area will achieve their objective through Turkey &apos;s accession .
if , on the other hand , we want a strong Europe with the capacity to act , the special relationship established by a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership is the appropriate means by which to fulfil this aim .
the European Council , at its meeting on F@@ rid@@ ay , must be min@@ d@@ ful of this responsibility .
.
I ab@@ sta@@ ined from voting on the European Commission &apos;s 2004 reg@@ ular report and recommendations regarding negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union for the following reasons .
I believe that the European Union &apos;s in@@ ability to for@@ mu@@ late , approve and construc@@ t a coherent political project is a major obsta@@ cle to the wel@@ coming of Turkey into the Community .

.
I will be voting in favour of opening negotiations with Turkey for membership of the European Union .
Turkey does not as yet meet the criteria for membership .
its record on human rights with respect to its K@@ ur@@ dis@@ h and As@@ sy@@ rian minorities is deep@@ ly fla@@ wed .
its record with respect to trade union rights is poor .
it has failed properly to come to terms with the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide .
yet n@@ one of these should be seen as bar@@ riers to starting a process that will enable the Commission and Parliament to press for their correc@@ tion .
a &apos; yes &apos; vote today will support the campa@@ ig@@ ns of all prog@@ res@@ sive forces in Turkey to sh@@ ed the last re@@ m@@ n@@ ants of Turkey &apos;s author@@ ita@@ rian past .
if together we can achieve these changes I will support Turkey join@@ ing the Union , as my Europe is based on shared values that are not limited to one particular set of religious values and beli@@ ef@@ s .
if we do not achieve this , I will vote &apos; no &apos; , even if the economic conditions have been met .
.
I voted in favour of opening the process of Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU .
this does not enta@@ il making a final decision on this process , which will take years to negoti@@ ate .
furthermore , I voted against partnership status , because that would mean that the EU has not hon@@ ou@@ red its promis@@ es .
I voted in favour , particularly in light of the tes@@ ti@@ mon@@ ies of numerous Turkish human rights def@@ end@@ ers , who have confirmed that there have been positive developments in Turkey .
those developments are not sufficient , of course ; there are still political pris@@ oners , there is still tor@@ ture in pris@@ ons and there remains much to do .
sto@@ pp@@ ing the process of opening negotiations at this time would have terri@@ ble consequences for the human rights situation in Turkey .
I voted in favour , although we have not had the opportunity for serious con@@ tem@@ pla@@ tion as to where Europe should extend , and because I do not accept the political and cultural borders of the &apos; Christian C@@ lu@@ b Europe , &quot; nor the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies of the &apos; clas@@ h of civil@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
I voted in favour , provided that Turkey recogn@@ ises , without delay , the EU Member State of Cyprus , and with@@ dra@@ ws , without delay , from the part of Cyprus that it occ@@ up@@ ies mili@@ tar@@ ily .
I voted in favour of acknowled@@ ging the gen@@ oc@@ ide of the Ar@@ men@@ ian people by Turkey , as I believe that this is essential for re@@ conciliation with its neighbours and with its history .
the June Lis@@ t does not view Turkey &apos;s ge@@ ograph@@ ical position or its Mus@@ li@@ m religi@@ on as obstacles to its membership of the EU .
we welcome the fact that Turkey is drawing closer to the EU .
we must not , however , close our e@@ yes to the fact that both Turkey and the EU must change before full EU membership is possible .
Turkey must acknowledge the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide .
it must give its minorities full human rights .
it must achieve a level of economic development such that its membership does not rele@@ ase ten@@ sions that may threa@@ ten the internal market .
the EU must also change .
the common agricultural policy must be ab@@ olis@@ hed , and structural policy must be revis@@ ed before Turkey , large and poor as it is , can be ab@@ sor@@ bed .
to ensure g@@ ras@@ s @-@ ro@@ ots support , membership negotiations should , moreover , only be embar@@ ked upon once the issue has been deb@@ ated in the Member States &quot; election campa@@ ig@@ ns up until 200@@ 8 .
finally , the issue of the EU &apos;s Constitution must be sol@@ ved before the EU adop@@ ts a position on the issue of negotiations concerning Turkish membership .
.
I voted against this report .
our fellow citizens are concerned about these future enlarg@@ ements , and above all about the continuing lack of respon@@ ses to the crucial question of where Europe &apos;s borders li@@ e .
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it has occu@@ pi@@ ed for 30 years , and it pun@@ is@@ hes anyone who ref@@ ers to the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide .
n@@ in@@ ety @-@ se@@ ven per cent of Turkey &apos;s territory is outside Europe , and Turkey therefore has no right to join the European Union .
Turkey &apos;s integration into the EU would be tan@@ tam@@ oun@@ t to rejec@@ ting a political Europe stra@@ i@@ gh@@ ta@@ way , before it has even come into being , and to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating the im@@ age of a Europe subject to bla@@ ck@@ ma@@ il and pressure .
would this be a sensible course of action ?
those in favour of Turkey &apos;s accession h@@ ide behind the Copenhagen criteria under the pre@@ text that Turkey could one day ad@@ here to them , yet this is a tric@@ k .
it is not enough to insist only on ad@@ her@@ ence to these criteria as an in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble condition to be met before any new accession , because this would mean that any country in the world which ad@@ her@@ ed to them could , in its turn , join the European Union .
this is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership put forward by France .
.
today this House has finally reached a decision on Turkey &apos;s membership of the European Union .
this was a vote eag@@ er@@ ly a@@ wa@@ ited by European citizens , who s@@ tru@@ gg@@ le to understand their governments &quot; att@@ it@@ ud@@ es on this issue .
I voted against the draft report by Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings , as it came to the conclusion that &apos; the European Council &#91; should &#93; open the negotiations with Turkey without un@@ due delay , &quot; and that &apos; the objective of the negotiations is Turkish EU membership . &quot;
the European project is a well @-@ defined one , the aim of which is to share a number of competences between neighbour@@ ing and similar countries in order to build a new political whole .
integra@@ ting Turkey into this whole would be problem@@ atic for a number of reasons .
firstly , Turkey is not part of the European continent in ge@@ ograph@@ ical terms , as over 90 % of its territory is in Asia , and 90 % of its borders are with A@@ sian countries .
secondly , throughout history Turkey has shared n@@ one of our values , with such values ensuring that Europe today is based on a foun@@ d@@ ation of common trad@@ itions kept ali@@ ve by all of us .
finally , I should like to advan@@ ce a w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ty argument which directly affec@@ ts our institutional structure ; if Turkey en@@ ters the European Union it will have the larg@@ est population of any Member State , which will mean ...
.
the European Parlia@@ mentary L@@ ab@@ our Party strongly wel@@ comes the clear recommendation in this resolution , that EU leaders should announ@@ ce the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey without delay .
we recognise the sens@@ iti@@ v@@ ities with regard to issues sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding Turkey &apos;s relations with Ar@@ men@@ ia , however these will be dealt with during the negotiations process .
the report does not in any way imp@@ ly that resolution of these issues is a pre@@ condition to opening talks .
we also regis@@ ter our opposition to any permanent safegu@@ ards affec@@ ting free movement of workers .
Turkey should receive equal , fair and proper treatment during the negotiations .
- A@@ s Cha@@ irman of the European Parliament &apos;s Del@@ e@@ gation on the countries of the South C@@ auc@@ as@@ us , I welcome the adoption by a large majority of the Eur@@ l@@ ings report on opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and would reiterate how crucial it is for the peoples of Europe and for the stability of an entire continent to open the do@@ ors of the European Union to this country .
I regret the fact that the European Union did not make the issue of lif@@ ting the b@@ loc@@ ka@@ de and opening the border with Turkey &apos;s neigh@@ bour , Ar@@ men@@ ia , part of the discussions on Turkey &apos;s possible accession from the out@@ set , and I regret that Turkey has not taken this historic opportunity to show go@@ od@@ will by opening its border with Ar@@ men@@ ia .
yet using the border issue and the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide as reasons to ref@@ use to open up to Turkey , as right @-@ wing French political parties in particular have done , is unacceptable .
they are wrong to b@@ ran@@ dis@@ h this argument so soon before the Council makes its decision on opening negotiations , and their only purpose in so doing is to h@@ ide their real reasons for rejec@@ ting Turkey &apos;s integration .
- Mor@@ e and more European nations , following the example of the French , Ger@@ man@@ s , Gre@@ e@@ ks and Austri@@ ans , are show@@ ing their opposition to Turkey , an A@@ sian country which is part of the Mus@@ li@@ m world , enter@@ ing Europe .
the leaders of the Europe of Brussels , in particular Mr C@@ hi@@ ra@@ c , are well aware of this .
that is why they are maintaining that opening the accession negotiations would not autom@@ ati@@ cally lead to Turkey &apos;s accession .
this as@@ ser@@ tion , repe@@ ated in Mr Eur@@ l@@ ings &quot; report , is an un@@ truth : since the first enlargement of 197@@ 2 , every negoti@@ ation process has been followed by the accession of the candidate country .
it will be the same for Turkey , especially as its Isla@@ mis@@ t leaders have war@@ ned us that they will not make any conc@@ es@@ sions .
if on 17 December , against the will of the people , the European Council decid@@ es to open accession negotiations with the Turkish Government , the referendum on the European Constitution will be France &apos;s last opportunity to avoid being s@@ w@@ allowed up in a union that is European in name alone , and in which Turkey , the most pop@@ ul@@ ous country , will play a pro@@ min@@ ent part .
- I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deep@@ er political integration and created a power@@ ful Europe and a social Europe .
with each enlargement the pros@@ pect of a feder@@ al Europe f@@ ad@@ es .
Turkey &apos;s entry will further d@@ ilu@@ te the European project , and it is not des@@ ira@@ ble for it to be integrated into the EU in its present form .
the issue that will ar@@ ise for everyone has nothing to do with either religi@@ on or ge@@ ograph@@ y : the European Union has to be a political project .
this project is now under threat because it is being limited to a free @-@ trade area with less and less regulation .
we need to over@@ ha@@ u@@ l the ar@@ ch@@ ite@@ c@@ ture of Europe and have a feder@@ al cor@@ e , then a Union of 27 countries and then a zone of enhan@@ ced cooperation with neighbour@@ ing countries such as Turkey , and also other countries like the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b countries , with which we enjo@@ y close lin@@ ks .
ap@@ prov@@ ing the opening of negotiations makes this a more dis@@ tant pros@@ pect and continues a policy of ongoing enlargement .
legitimate requirements are made of Turkey , but it goes without saying that if this country meet@@ s them it will be impossible to ref@@ use it entry .
before any possible accession negotiations we need to define the future sha@@ pe of Europe .
we should reject enlargement and begin a different kind of cooperation with Turkey .
.
as a Member of this House , I have bel@@ ong@@ ed to the parliamentary fri@@ end@@ ship group with Turkey for as long as it has exis@@ ted .
no one , therefore , can acc@@ use me of not being well @-@ dis@@ posed towards Turkey .
as things stand , however , I feel I am justified in asking whether all the conditions - especially as regards human rights - have genuinely been fulfi@@ lled .
I gla@@ dly acknowledge that on the issue of women &apos;s rights , for example , more reforms have been introduced since Turkey was granted the pros@@ pect of accession than in the dec@@ ad@@ es before .
nonetheless , they have largely taken place on paper ; the reality still la@@ gs behind .
I was recently conf@@ ron@@ ted with information alle@@ ging that ster@@ il@@ is@@ ations of K@@ ur@@ dis@@ h women have been carried out in Turkey .
when we signed an Association Agreement with Turkey in 19@@ 6@@ 3 , which offer@@ ed the pros@@ pect of membership , the European Union did not exist ; at that time , we were still the European Economic Community .
since a custom@@ s union with Turkey has exis@@ ted since 1996 , what we have now is very similar to an economic community in which any remain@@ ing trade bar@@ riers can be dis@@ man@@ t@@ led s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly .
from this perspective too , and because there is no question that Turkey must remain fully an@@ cho@@ red in European structures , the option of a ta@@ il@@ or @-@ made special status instead of the discrimin@@ atory membership deal proposed by the Commission would appear to be a more acc@@ es@@ sible and honourable path for Turkey , asi@@ de from the fact that there are justified doub@@ ts ...
. - I voted in favour of the report by Mr Ε@@ ur@@ l@@ ings on Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession to the European Union , because it is the product of compromise between the various political groups in the European Parliament .
however , I am in no way b@@ ound by the ph@@ r@@ ase in paragraph 38 concerning use of the Ann@@ an plan as a basis for efforts to sett@@ le the Cyprus question , in that this plan was rejected by 7@@ 6 % of Greek Cy@@ pri@@ ots and 6@@ 7 % of all Cy@@ pri@@ ots .
as Article 38 rightly says , a solution can be found on the basis of the principles upon which the EU is foun@@ ded .
I also have reser@@ vations about the ex@@ act content of paragraph 39 , which I consider to be in@@ compatible with the report by Mrs M@@ ech@@ ti@@ ld Ro@@ the , which the European Parliament voted in favour of about a month ago ( see : Ro@@ the report , Amendment No 2 , R@@ ec@@ ital 4@@ a ( new ) ( 4@@ a ) pa@@ ge 6 / 15 ) .
.
since the A@@ ta@@ t@@ ü@@ r@@ k re@@ v@@ olution in 19@@ 23 , Turkey has been a ty@@ pic@@ ally European country , al@@ be@@ it of the old @-@ fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ed , author@@ ita@@ rian kind , which we no longer want in Europe these days .
the ar@@ my &apos;s power is im@@ men@@ se ; there are political pris@@ oners ; parties and new@@ s@@ paper@@ s are often bann@@ ed and an elector@@ al th@@ res@@ hold of 10 % ke@@ ep@@ s even most legal parties outside of parliament .
K@@ ur@@ ds , Ar@@ men@@ ians and As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans are given the choice between lea@@ ving the country or adap@@ ting to the language , the culture and religi@@ on of the Turkish majority .
Turkey must change a great deal before we can welcome it , not only in its legislation but also in daily life .
after more than 40 years , it is now proposed to open negotiations shor@@ tly with a view to full membership of the EU .
that is also what the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin want .
a decision as to whether Turkey may join will be made not before , but during , the negotiations .
there is the risk that the Turkish Government may consider that after three or five years &quot; negotiations , Turkey deser@@ ves EU membership , without the problems of democracy , human rights and eth@@ nic minorities having been resolved by then , with the potential for conflicts and an even@@ tual ri@@ ft .
the Copenhagen criteria must not be re@@ placed by An@@ kar@@ a criteria .
.
I have voted for Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession despite having serious reser@@ vations .
I would like to emphasise that my reason for voting Turkey &apos;s progress towards accession is because it is a Mus@@ li@@ m country and will serve as an important br@@ id@@ ge between Europe and the Middle East in particular .
I have concerns , however , that Turkey still has a very large number of human rights ab@@ uses .
I also have concerns that a country with such a mas@@ sive number of people living in poverty will not be able to reach the levels ac@@ qui@@ red in the , and I fear that the emphasis has been on the market access to Turkey rather than the need for Turkey to con@@ form to the social and environmental standards in the EU .
I am not interested in seeing the enlargement of Europe simply in order to see a larg@@ er market .
an equal emphasis must be placed on social and environmental considerations .
. - The delegation has voted for the Eur@@ l@@ ings report on the opening of the accession procedure for Turkey , a procedure that will take several years .
the opening of the procedure une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally her@@ al@@ ds a change in the political course ste@@ ered by the Turkish Government , not only in respect of the Community and the Copenhagen conditions but especially concerning the resolution of the Ar@@ men@@ ian and the K@@ ur@@ dis@@ h questions .
the believes that the Council decision of 17 December should make it une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally clear that the opening of negotiations with Turkey requires the Turkish Government &apos;s recognition of the State of Cyprus , a full Member State of the European Union , and consequently the resolution of the Cy@@ pri@@ ot question , which means the with@@ dra@@ w@@ al of the 3@@ 5@@ .000 Turkish tro@@ op@@ s which , in occ@@ up@@ ying Cyprus , are occ@@ up@@ ying a territory of the European Union .
the will w@@ at@@ ch to ensure that the guarantees and conditions included in the report are compli@@ ed with , because a successful conclusion to Turkey &apos;s jour@@ ne@@ y towards accession will not be possible unless they are compli@@ ed with .
. - Turkey &apos;s possible accession to the European Union brings with it many benefits and a few risks .
the benefits are more political than economic since , as well as being a member of NATO , Turkey has signed a custom@@ s union treaty with the European Union that already per@@ m@@ its free trade .
its accession would not only fulfil the dre@@ am of millions of citizens of fully bel@@ ong@@ ing to the sec@@ ular w@@ estern world , but it would shi@@ ft the centre of gra@@ vity of political and economic influence towards the Mediterranean b@@ as@@ in , confir@@ ming Europe as a world power no longer closed in within its ge@@ opol@@ it@@ ical b@@ oun@@ d@@ aries .
on the other hand , the risks that should be taken into consideration are , first , the reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ o@@ od of seeing the b@@ ir@@ th of a Europe with its own common foreign policy , as well as the possible difficul@@ ty of making two di@@ ver@@ se religious and cultural id@@ ent@@ ities co@@ exist .
can it descri@@ be itself yet as a democratic state that res@@ pects its eth@@ nic minorities ?
secondly , it would have a negative effect on the alloc@@ ation of European funds to regions currently considered to be &apos; la@@ gg@@ ing behind in their development , &quot; such as S@@ ic@@ ily , at least in the short term .
lastly , Turkey should with@@ draw from that part of Cyprus under military occu@@ pation , and it goes without saying that it must dec@@ l@@ are its willingness to s@@ qu@@ are its account with history by acknowled@@ ging the er@@ ro@@ rs it has made over the last hun@@ d@@ red years ...
- I ab@@ sta@@ ined from the final vote on the Eur@@ l@@ ings report .
it would , firstly , be reasonable not to consider any further enlargement before first decid@@ ing where Europe &apos;s borders li@@ e .
pus@@ hing back their limits inde@@ fin@@ i@@ tely risks turning Europe into nothing more than a vas@@ t free @-@ trade area .
such a ren@@ oun@@ cement is an@@ a@@ them@@ a to convinced feder@@ alists .
secondly , experience shows that once negotiations have been open@@ ed , accession ine@@ vi@@ tably follows once the candidate country meet@@ s the conditions laid down , and in particular the Copenhagen criteria .
but although we might legitim@@ ately hope that Turkey will continue to build on the progress it has made , particularly on democracy and human rights , there is as yet no guarantee that Europe is prepared to provide the resources , not least the budgetary resources , to go ahead with such an enlargement in a mu@@ tually satisfactory way .
my abs@@ ten@@ tion is then a war@@ ning to the European Summit of 17 December : no more enlargement without deep@@ er integration !
we have to stop pres@@ enting the peoples of Europe with and ins@@ truc@@ ting them to rati@@ fy decisions taken in their abs@@ ence several years earlier by the Heads of State or Government .
.
this report up@@ da@@ tes Turkey &apos;s development as regards its even@@ tual accession to the EU , in common with the report by Mr O@@ os@@ tlan@@ der adopted on 1 April .
as I had the opportunity to wr@@ ite then , I feel that Turkey was perhaps has@@ ti@@ ly recognised by the Council as a candidate for accession .
in the same way , I believe that the Commission recently repe@@ ated the mis@@ take when it de@@ em@@ ed that the Copenhagen criteria have already been satisfied , while there are still situations such as those detailed in the motion for a resolution that are bla@@ tan@@ tly at vari@@ ance with this position .
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;s position that this must be an open @-@ en@@ ded process , without a pre@@ determined outcome , al@@ be@@ it a process that does point towards accession .
I also share his desire to see that , regar@@ d@@ less of the outcome , Turkey pres@@ ses ahead with and firmly establis@@ hes the welcome reforms that it has been car@@ rying out .
in so doing it will confirm its cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that res@@ pects human rights .
- I supported opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and I did so for one reason above all : I want a better world for tomorrow , character@@ ised by stability and security .
no one can see into the future , but I know one thing : shar@@ ing this area of peace and democracy on which our Union is foun@@ ded is a uni@@ que opportunity that we cannot allow to sli@@ p away .
yes , we should stand firm in the name of histor@@ ical truth , which is why I continue , as I have done in the past , to demand that the Turkish authorities acknowledge their part in the Ar@@ men@@ ian gen@@ oc@@ ide .
one truth and one history : we o@@ we it to that same history also to remember that for 50 years Turkey has played an essential role as a lo@@ y@@ al ally at the ga@@ tes of Europe .
standing firm means sen@@ ding out a strong message : the mar@@ ri@@ age will only take place if further considerable progress is made on respect for minorities and gender equality .
I am pleased that the European Parliament supported my amendment to Par@@ agrap@@ h 26 on z@@ ero toler@@ ance with regard to crimes of hon@@ our .
in conclusion , I would ask that the people have a say in the final decision : referendum or consul@@ tations ...
. many advantages could be ga@@ ined from Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union , above all an extension of the common market and a strengthening of transatlan@@ tic lin@@ ks .
yet both these goals can be achieved without Turkey join@@ ing the European Union .
the European Economic A@@ re@@ a is an excellent example of a pla@@ t@@ form for good economic cooperation with the EU .
it could also be useful to propose a reform of security policy to Turkey , as the country is one of Europe &apos;s major strategic partners in the field of security .
a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged partnership of this kind with Turkey would provide us with the chance of avoid@@ ing a crisis of agricultural policy and cohesion policy .
if we wish to avoid mi@@ gration @-@ related conflicts , we should not be instru@@ mental in a Mus@@ li@@ m country becoming the European Union &apos;s larg@@ est Member State in the ne@@ ar future .
it is estima@@ ted that Turkey will have a population of around 90 million in 20@@ 20 .
the development of closer relations with Turkey should also be kept more in propor@@ tion to Europe &apos;s policy of op@@ enn@@ ess towards Ukraine .
these are all good reasons why we cannot vote in favour of the Eur@@ l@@ ings report .
we consider it to be im@@ pr@@ ud@@ ent , as despite serious grounds for opposition to Turkey &apos;s membership in the EU it continues to support such a membership .
the ongoing discussion of Turkey &apos;s chan@@ ces of join@@ ing the European Union will fu@@ el increased res@@ ent@@ ment in Turkey .
.
I supported the Eur@@ l@@ ings report and should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work .
I will say this in public since we were unable to demonstrate our position in another way on account of the unfor@@ tun@@ ate sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot .
my vote in favour of opening negotiations certainly does not mean that I cannot wait for them to start .
my group rightly believes that it is actually too soon , and I share that view .
at the same time , though , we would like to remain realistic , because after all , the tra@@ in was put in motion in 1999 and in 2002 .
moreover , we expect that the European Council will give the negotiations the gre@@ en light .
what matters to us in the b@@ all@@ ot is that the Union should re@@ tain its credibility and that we send a clear message about the conditions under which these open @-@ en@@ ded negotiations are to proceed .
the conditions in the report are strict , but fair .
we support them wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly , and that is why I have voted in favour .
.
I voted in favour of the report before us because I feel that the initiatives concerned , which are intended to adopt a Council decision on vehic@@ le crime with cross @-@ border implications , addres@@ ses the concerns that we ought to have as regards combating crime .
furthermore , despite the fact that con@@ fer@@ ring direct access to S@@ I@@ S may appear to run counter to the rule that &apos; data may not be used for administrative purposes , &quot; the truth is that the necessary safegu@@ ards are in place to ensure that this cannot happen in this case .
.
vehic@@ le the@@ ft makes up a significant propor@@ tion of crime and has cross @-@ border implications for the EU , and as such is an issue requ@@ ir@@ ing urgent action .
one must also take into account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often than not only one element of broad@@ er criminal activity , en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing various types of crime s@@ pread across an enormous ge@@ ograph@@ ical area .
it is therefore crucial that the movement and regis@@ tra@@ tion process for vehicles from other Member States and , indeed , third countries is mon@@ ito@@ red extremely carefully .
the rapporteur was right to obser@@ ve that the new fe@@ a@@ ture of the Dutch proposal is that of national contact points .
I feel that it will be useful to monitor the effectiveness of their activities and perio@@ dic@@ ally to review the methods and practices adopted .
the Commission &apos;s White Paper on the subject , as proposed by the rapporteur , will accor@@ d this issue a broad@@ er scope .
.
it should be pointed out , however , that there is a long way to go on this issue , especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that res@@ pects the existing cultural diversity , where@@ by policies are put in place that promote small and medium @-@ sized farming , in contr@@ ast with the current measures in place , which , if they achieve their aims , will sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ e and pen@@ alise farmers with fe@@ wer resources .
the creation of M@@ R@@ L@@ s on pes@@ tic@@ ides in food for ...
.
I welcome this report and the objectives contained within it .
however , we must remember that having established regulations for maximum resid@@ ue levels of pes@@ tic@@ ides in food and feed of pl@@ ant and animal origin , the main priority must be that it is properly implemented and regula@@ ted .
consumers deser@@ ve to be protected and thorou@@ gh implementation can safe @-@ gu@@ ard their rights .
.
I wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly welcome this report , because I consider that rec@@ as@@ ting and stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ing Community legislation in this area fos@@ ters trade within the internal market and with third countries , and does no har@@ m from a Portuguese perspective .
.
the proposal before us seeks to rec@@ ast Community legislation on pes@@ tic@@ ides by re@@ pla@@ cing the four directives in force with one single regulation .
the proposal also seeks to safeguard certain key objectives , such as establishing a hom@@ og@@ en@@ ous level of consumer protection throughout the Community , by defin@@ ing the role of the European Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety Authority , and by increasing the trade in fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ff@@ s within the EU .
I believe that significant progress has been made between the first and second read@@ ings , namely the Council &apos;s adoption of both the amendments tabled by Parliament and the introduction of amendments to its initiative , which have certainly improved the Commission &apos;s original proposal .
I feel , however , that there remain aspects that could be clari@@ fied , such as the distinc@@ tion between resid@@ ues - in the context of maximum resid@@ ue limits ( M@@ R@@ L@@ s ) - and pes@@ tic@@ ides .
I agree with the rapporteur , however , that when M@@ R@@ L@@ s are exc@@ eeded , those responsible must be held to account and sub@@ groups that may consu@@ me more of a certain type of product must be fully protected .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that we have made our position clear to Russia .
like Turkey , Russia is a country which is only par@@ tly European and will never join the EU , but it is an extremely important part@@ ner .
however , precisely because it is an important part@@ ner , we must ste@@ ad@@ fas@@ tly op@@ pose the syste@@ matic dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of democracy and the rule of law in Russia and the continuing gen@@ oc@@ ide against the Chech@@ en people in a c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial war .
I therefore wish to send a clear message to President Pu@@ tin from this House : we regard Russia as an important part@@ ner , but the statement which he has made against Ukraine , its liber@@ ation movement and the liber@@ ation of Central and E@@ as@@ tern Europe is an attack on free Europe .
we are hop@@ ing for cooperation here , not for a contin@@ uation of this unacceptable conf@@ ron@@ tation course .
.
I voted in favour of this motion for a joint resolution because I feel that the question before us - relations between the EU and Russia , which is an important international pla@@ yer and the most important neigh@@ bour of many of the countries covered by our neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy - is cru@@ ci@@ ally important for the future of the area that we share throughout the European continent , and as regards certain concerns at world level .
nevertheless , I must point out that , in s@@ pite of the reser@@ vations that I have expressed , I welcome the concern at Russia &apos;s inter@@ ference in countries that were pre@@ viously part of its sp@@ here of influence .
.
the strategic rele@@ van@@ ce of relations between the EU and the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation is un@@ den@@ i@@ able , and the ongoing initiatives to promote and institution@@ alise those relations are to be welcomed .
indeed , common borders and interests comb@@ ine to create an enlarged area of understanding , given the mutual interest in maintaining permanent dialogue on the fields proposed for the four common sp@@ ac@@ es , the common economic space ; the common space of freedom , security and justice ; the common space of cooperation in the field of external security ; the common space of research , education and culture .
that is not to over@@ look the wor@@ rying sig@@ ns in the area of human rights and civil liber@@ ties that have come to light in Russia , as regards political processes and procedures and the question of Chechnya .
the same can also be said of M@@ os@@ co@@ w &apos;s disas@@ tro@@ us interven@@ tions , recently in Ukraine and pre@@ viously in Geor@@ gia and Belarus , which have done nothing to benefit the political processes of those countries .
I note and appreciate the desire shown by Russia to cel@@ eb@@ rate the 6@@ 0@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the Sec@@ ond World W@@ ar , but I completely reject the manner in which the vic@@ tory for democracy and freedom is compared with the criminal tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian sub@@ ju@@ gation to which all peoples to the e@@ ast of the ir@@ on cur@@ tain were sub@@ jec@@ ted .
.
the two Commission commun@@ ications on the common asylum policy are most welcome .
they are intended to raise the standard of application of the current directives in the EU , providing for the possibility of a review and to improve conditions for the vas@@ t majority of refugees within the region they are fle@@ eing .
I welcome these Commission proposals intended to improve the assessment process by adopting a single procedure , thereby simp@@ lif@@ ying the process for both the applic@@ ant and the administration .
improvements are to be introduced to training , in @-@ country assessment and the related information and judicial procedures .
I also welcome the additional measures proposed , which offer the means for managed , legal entry into the EU , not least if they help to reduce trafficking in human beings , along with the intention to develop high @-@ quality protection reg@@ imes in receiv@@ ing countries .
I cannot agree , however , with some of the proposals put forward by Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t in her report and shall , therefore , be voting against . one of the main reasons why I reject the report is that it plans to extend the scope of the Directive on minimum standards for procedures
. I supported , spoke in favour and voted in favour of J@@ ean Den@@ ise Lam@@ ber@@ t &apos;s report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin ( 2004 / 2@@ 12@@ 1 ( IN@@ I ) ) on A@@ sy@@ lu@@ m .
the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy .
however I have strong reser@@ vations about point 19 when it states &apos; Con@@ si@@ ders that a decisive common foreign and security policy commit@@ ting the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention ... &quot;
S@@ in@@ n F@@ é@@ in believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negoti@@ ation as an alternative to military intervention .
however we are w@@ ary of the mo@@ ves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermin@@ e national soverei@@ gn@@ ty .
the most appropriate vehic@@ le for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of the United Nations .
the EU should play a more pr@@ o @-@ active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context .
.
whilst we do not accept , and are in fact critical of , certain aspects of this E@@ P initiative report , such as its sup@@ ran@@ ational out@@ look and its support for the common foreign and security policy , we also appreciate its positive aspects .
we feel that , as part of the current policies pursu@@ ed at EU level , this resolution critic@@ ises very mil@@ dly , and does not condemn clearly , the impact of the current EU asylum policy .
it does , however , among other points , highlight this threat to &apos; the European humanitarian tradition &quot; and critic@@ ises what is ter@@ med the &apos; out@@ s@@ our@@ cing &quot; of the process of application by sen@@ ding applic@@ ants for refuge@@ e status to a third country , and condem@@ ns the l@@ eng@@ thy proc@@ essing of asylum claim@@ s .
the resolution contains a number of points that we welcome , such as its call for strict compliance with international standards , en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing the principle that refugees may not be ex@@ pe@@ lled ( allowing the asylum see@@ ker to enter the country in which the request was made ) ; the rejec@@ tion of any funding for de@@ ten@@ tion cam@@ ps or any other centre restric@@ ting asylum see@@ kers &quot; personal freedom ; and an end to the policy of re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ation and read@@ mission aimed at sen@@ ding immigrants back to their countries of origin , as our group had proposed .
hence our vote in favour .
the report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin is part of establishing the first stage of a common European asylum system , and the aim is to apply one and the same procedure to international protection in all the Member States .
the June Lis@@ t does not , however , wish to contribute to any For@@ t@@ ress Europe . an EU Member State must be able to conduct a gener@@ ous refuge@@ e policy if it wishes to do so .
we cannot therefore support the report .
- T@@ his report is a further step towards the adoption of a single asylum procedure .
cu@@ ri@@ ously , it does not apply sol@@ ely to political refugees , who should nevertheless be the only ones entitled to apply for asylum under the Gen@@ eva Convention .
it also applies to all of those who might benefit from &apos; subsidi@@ ary protection , &quot; that is those who cannot return home because of the general situation in their country of origin .
the future European asylum application procedure will therefore cover all those who wish to mi@@ gra@@ te .
it is true that in the bor@@ der@@ less Europe of Brussels there is a political tradition of syste@@ ma@@ tically fos@@ tering immigration .
moreover , Par@@ agrap@@ h 25 of the report states that we need , &apos; a common asylum procedure within the EU based upon high standards of deli@@ very . &quot;
this report on the rights of mi@@ grants makes no mention of illegal immigrants , however .
furthermore , the return policy is stric@@ tly defined : the ref@@ us@@ al to grant asylum has to be du@@ ly reason@@ ed in wr@@ iting in an &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ated document &quot; in the applic@@ ant &apos;s own language , and it is not possible to use char@@ ter f@@ li@@ ghts .
in addition , the report rules out the possibility of setting up de@@ ten@@ tion c@@ ent@@ res in tr@@ ansi@@ t countries .
.
I wish to congratulate Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t on her important and ti@@ mely report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin .
I endorse the report , in particular where it proposes , in addition to the current European common asylum policy , the creation of measures both to develop or@@ der@@ ly and better organised entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection and to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin .
the aim is therefore to protect , at an early stage , political asylum see@@ kers and refugees who , given the l@@ eng@@ thy proc@@ essing of asylum claim@@ s , especially in crisis situations , may res@@ or@@ t to illegal means of travel , which may undermin@@ e their personal security .
statistics show that in 2003 some 70 % of the world &apos;s refugees remain@@ ed in their region of origin .
it is therefore essential to offer greater protection of better quality in those regions , but to be clear that this is in addition to the EU &apos;s current responsibilities to offer protection under international agreements .
.
I welcome this report as it stres@@ ses the need for a high quality asylum procedure that acts ac@@ qui@@ es@@ cent and compatible with the Gen@@ eva Con@@ ven@@ tions in addition to other existing international legal instruments .
I am in agreement with this report where@@ by the speed and administrative efficiency are important in assess@@ ing any system but they cannot be the only criteria when people &apos;s fu@@ tures are at risk .
I commen@@ d the report for rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ing that although the intention to develop high quality protection reg@@ imes in con@@ jun@@ ction with receiv@@ ing countries is to be welcomed but should not become a means to enhan@@ ce border control with the inten@@ t of preventing people moving on or a way of ab@@ dic@@ ating our own protection responsibilities .
.
I supported , spoke in favour and voted in favour of J@@ ean Den@@ ise Lam@@ ber@@ t &apos;s report on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin ( 2004 / 2@@ 12@@ 1 ( IN@@ I ) ) on A@@ sy@@ lu@@ m .
the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of the report was positive and in line with my own party policy .
however I have strong reser@@ vations about point 19 when it states &apos; Con@@ si@@ ders that a decisive common foreign and security policy commit@@ ting the EU as a matter of priority to the resolution of long terms conflicts and conflict prevention .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ .@@ ... &apos;
S@@ in@@ n F@@ é@@ in believes that the EU through its member states must play a greater role in conflict prevention and resolution and in promoting dialogue and negoti@@ ation as an alternative to military intervention .
however we are w@@ ary of the mo@@ ves within the EU towards the development of a common foreign and security policy as this would undermin@@ e national soverei@@ gn@@ ty .
the most appropriate vehic@@ le for dealing with such issues is through member state cooperation and under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of the United Nations .
the EU should play a more pr@@ o @-@ active role on conflict resolution and prevention within this context .
.
my opinion of this report is based on the following main factors :
on the one hand , I am in favour of some of the essential issues raised , in particular where the report proposes to establish univers@@ al standards for applying existing directives , and advo@@ ca@@ tes improving conditions for the vas@@ t majority of refugees in the countries of origin .
on the other hand , I dis@@ agree on a key point : the application of asylum procedures to other situations of subsidi@@ ary protection .
in the end , I voted against the report in light of the vote on certain amendments that I considered fundamental .
.
the approach to issues relating to the gran@@ ting of asylum has s@@ w@@ un@@ g between two extre@@ me perspec@@ tives , neither of which has , in practice , proved an effective means of resol@@ ving the problem .
the truth is that neither the concept of For@@ t@@ ress Europe nor that of San@@ c@@ tu@@ ary Europe has much to do with reality .
they are both car@@ ic@@ a@@ tures , distor@@ tions of a complex issue that is in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally linked to people &apos;s rights and expectations and to the need to safeguard collective security and public order .
at a time when the area of freedom , security and justice is being consolid@@ ated , I feel that it is appropriate to address this issue and the role of countries of origin and of tr@@ ansi@@ t in the problem before us .
whilst I understand the gener@@ os@@ ity under@@ p@@ inning the rapporteur &apos;s proposal , I cannot vote in favour of it , because , as regards gran@@ ting refuge@@ e status , the proposal does not only deal with the cases of individuals - it wid@@ ens the scope to subsidi@@ ary protection , and this ra@@ ises doub@@ ts as to the appropri@@ a@@ ten@@ ess and propor@@ tion@@ ality of the proposal .
. - The Ε@@ U wants to remove by all possible means the victims of the intervention policy which it is following together with the USA in a series of countries .
anti @-@ asylum legislation , the in@@ human@@ e record nu@@ mb@@ ers of asylum requests ref@@ used and medi@@ a@@ e@@ val living conditions in immigration c@@ ent@@ res were not enough .
now it also as@@ pi@@ res to keep anyone seeking asylum , seeking international protection , outside the Ε@@ U .
only those who are o@@ be@@ di@@ ent and organised are accepted as necessary at the alta@@ r of the &apos; competitiveness &apos; of the European monopol@@ ies .
the proposed &apos; Community @-@ wide system of res@@ ett@@ l@@ ement &apos; is a man@@ t@@ le for public opinion to accept the creation of cam@@ ps to round up immigrants outside the Ε@@ U .
finally , the &apos; protected entry procedures &apos; promote non @-@ entry , in that asylum requests will be comple@@ ted in a country outside the Ε@@ U .
within the framework of the &apos; shar@@ ing of responsibilities &apos; between the Ε@@ U and third countries , the burden of keeping immigrants until the de@@ por@@ tation decision is form@@ ally received is being passed on to them .
the text is te@@ em@@ ing with refer@@ ences to human rights , ac@@ compan@@ ied by proposals and policies which viol@@ ate them .
co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve read@@ mission c@@ laus@@ es in agreements with third countries are advoc@@ ated .
there is not a word on combating the causes for the wa@@ ves of refugees .
a common foreign and security policy is advoc@@ ated which will pay greater attention to &apos; conflict prevention &apos; ; in other words , which will f@@ an the fla@@ mes of the fir@@ e ig@@ ni@@ ted by imperi@@ alism .
this report contains proposals and wor@@ dings that reflect a liber@@ al attitude towards drugs .
we are thus voting against the proposal .
we are opposed to drugs being classi@@ fied as &apos; so@@ ft &quot; or &apos; hard &quot; and to the fact that drugs described as &apos; so@@ ft &quot; are not regar@@ ded as add@@ ic@@ tive .
the &apos; alternative policy &quot; recommend@@ ed in the report involves a more liber@@ al policy towards drugs , emphas@@ ising har@@ m reduction measures against drug use , rather than preven@@ tive work .
we are opposed to a common EU drugs policy . such a policy would involve countries with a restric@@ tive drugs policy , such as Sweden , being forced to conduct a more len@@ i@@ ent and liber@@ al drugs policy .
it is up to each national Parliament in the EU to make decisions concerning their national drugs policies .
- D@@ ru@@ g consumption is on the increase throughout Europe .
around 7@@ .000 people di@@ e of over@@ d@@ os@@ es every year in the European Union , and three times as many di@@ e as an in@@ direct result of drug abuse ( su@@ ic@@ ide , violence , A@@ ID@@ S , road accidents , and so on ) .
it appears that Brussels wishes to tackle this s@@ cour@@ ge .
great , excep@@ t that what it is proposing in the fight against drugs is not to prevent young people from taking drugs or to give drug add@@ ic@@ ts the means to come cle@@ an , but to make drug add@@ ic@@ tion more hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic .
for example , it has tabled proposals for recovery ro@@ oms , ro@@ oms for in@@ jec@@ ting her@@ o@@ in under super@@ vision and need@@ le exchange programmes .
we cannot accept such a policy .
prevention is of course essential in the fight against drugs , but so is repres@@ sion .
we should increase the penal@@ ties for drug deal@@ ers and introduce court orders for me@@ dical follow @-@ up@@ s for users .
finally , we should not draw a distinc@@ tion between so@@ ft drugs and hard drugs , as neither are har@@ m@@ less .
moreover , this over @-@ simp@@ lis@@ tic classi@@ fication has led to a considerable increase in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is consumption .
we must not forget that there is scientific evidence lin@@ king the use of these drugs and mental health , with the oc@@ curr@@ ence of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia being between 30 % and 50 % higher in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is users .
.
I take the view that negotiations with Turkey should start as soon as Turkey comp@@ lies with the political Copenhagen criteria , for example in relation to the protection of human and women &apos;s rights , the combating of cor@@ ruption , the pun@@ is@@ hment of tor@@ ture and the out@@ la@@ wing of child labour .
Turkey has made im@@ pres@@ sive progress in these areas , but it is appar@@ ent from the reports by non @-@ governmental organisations that it has not yet achieved these objectives .
the negotiations will be commen@@ ced with a view to acqu@@ ir@@ ing Member State status , but if the conclusion seems appropriate that membership is not fe@@ asi@@ ble , other forms of cooperation are possible .
. this is a com@@ mend@@ able attempt to draw attention to the EU &apos;s increasing D@@ ru@@ g problem and find solutions using a scientific and practical approach .
steps to combat the drugs trade would threa@@ ten one of the most important sources of income for organised crime and terrorist organisations .
for example , according to the Europol report on organised crime , drugs production and trafficking continue to be the main activity pursu@@ ed by criminal groups in the EU .
no other field of organised crime is quite so pro@@ fi@@ table .
I welcome the view that a Community project should be laun@@ ched for the purpose of introducing alternative forms of de@@ ten@@ tion , so that drugs repres@@ sion ce@@ ases to focus exclu@@ sively on imp@@ ris@@ on@@ ment .
the anti @-@ drugs strategy should be regar@@ ded as a form of social intervention concentra@@ ting on the reasons for social un@@ rest with a view to preventing drugs use by re@@ fin@@ ing a strategy of repres@@ sion which is currently tar@@ ge@@ ted sol@@ ely at drug users .
.
the European Parlia@@ mentary L@@ ab@@ our Party voted for the Ca@@ ta@@ nia report on the EU drugs strategy because we believe it provides a comprehensive approach to tac@@ kl@@ ing the har@@ m done by particular drugs to individuals and to the spi@@ ral of crime , violence and trafficking caused by the trade in particular substances .
it addres@@ ses har@@ m reduction , add@@ ic@@ tion and crime .
on Amendment 2 concerning the issue of the distribution of particular substances under contro@@ lled circumstances , the E@@ P@@ L@@ P voted against both parts because we do not believe this amendment enhan@@ ces the report or is in line with the UK Government &apos;s drugs strategy , which the E@@ P@@ L@@ P fully supports .
.
the issue before us is the EU &apos;s anti @-@ drugs strategy that the Council decided to establish in June 2004 and that is set to be adopted at the next European Council .
this report goes against the gra@@ in of the EU &apos;s fundamental concep@@ ts , as it cho@@ os@@ es to take the view that the strategy currently being implemented is not be@@ aring fru@@ it , that in some cases it has viol@@ ated citizens &quot; rights and , accord@@ ingly , that a different path must be followed ; it even sugges@@ ts that some drugs should be dec@@ r@@ imin@@ alised .
furthermore - and this makes sense within the lo@@ gic of the report - it takes the view that the subsidiarity principle is not very important in this area .
this is not my understanding of what the anti @-@ drugs strategy ought to be . I therefore voted against .
.
the fact that this report was passed so n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly in the committee concerned shows that the rapporteur de@@ vi@@ ated from the European S@@ trate@@ gy against drugs , by proposing a solution that , to my mind , does not solve the problem , but rather exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates it .
it is nothing new in this House to see Members try to put liberalisation forward as a solution , to see the no@@ tion of damage lim@@ itation as the be @-@ all @-@ and @-@ end @-@ all and to speak the language of sur@@ ren@@ der when it comes to drug trafficking .
this practice already has a no@@ table history , with the common thre@@ ad being that it is up to the Member States to en@@ force it - at complete vari@@ ance with the subsidiarity principle , which must continue to apply to this issue - despite the need to coordin@@ ate the fight against drugs .
the s@@ la@@ ck@@ ness and dec@@ r@@ imin@@ alisation that have been proposed are well known ways of remo@@ ving responsibility from the public authorities and are a fal@@ se ally of those whose dri@@ ve and judg@@ ment have been sub@@ du@@ ed by the effects of drugs , and therefore constitute a deep@@ ly fla@@ wed message to give to the youn@@ g@@ est members of society .
it is ir@@ on@@ ic that the rapporteur ci@@ tes fundamental rights and claim@@ s to fight against an &apos; ide@@ ological approach &quot; to this subject , in order to justi@@ fy a highly ide@@ ological position that , stric@@ tly speaking , run@@ s counter to basic fundamental rights .
- O@@ n 16 and 17 December , the Council will decide on the new European Union An@@ ti @-@ D@@ ru@@ gs S@@ trate@@ gy for 2005 @-@ 20@@ 12 .
a political agreement has already been reached in the Council , with no transparency or democratic scru@@ tin@@ y by Parliament .
indeed the Council has been very re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to meet our repe@@ ated demands for information about the progress of negotiations , even though we were discussing the same issue in the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs .
today I voted in favour of Mr Ca@@ ta@@ nia &apos;s report , because the European Parliament has to show the Council what its vision of the new anti @-@ drugs strategy is for the years to come .
we note that the European strategy has achieved little to date , and at the same time , drug use has increased in Europe .
we therefore want to step up coordination and cooperation at European level so that Europe can bring added value to the fight against the s@@ cour@@ ge of drugs while respec@@ ting the principle of subsidiarity .
we must finally make the protection and health of drug users a priority .
we must therefore step up prevention , provide better care and enhan@@ ce health policy so as to avoid human tra@@ ge@@ dies and reduce exclusion .
. - The European Parliament recommendation has not taken account of the recent annual report of the European Mon@@ itoring C@@ en@@ tre for D@@ ru@@ gs and D@@ ru@@ g A@@ d@@ d@@ ition , which dem@@ olis@@ hes the so @-@ called Dutch exper@@ im@@ ent and the argument that c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is is alle@@ g@@ ed@@ ly har@@ m@@ less .
in the name of a non @-@ exis@@ tent realis@@ m , the recommendation distor@@ ts the nature of the problem from a social to a me@@ dical problem , something which results in sub@@ mission and de@@ fe@@ at@@ ism .
the rapporteur endeav@@ ours to achieve the general application of the Dutch exper@@ im@@ ent through the back do@@ or , adopting the dangerous approach of divid@@ ing drugs into so@@ ft and hard .
he uses the word &apos; consumers &apos; instead of victims / users and proposes the creation of official drug administration c@@ ent@@ res .
as a consequ@@ ence of this dangerous approach , all the proposals which d@@ et@@ rac@@ t from the primary concern - prevention - focus on damage lim@@ itation ( sub@@ stitu@@ tion programmes ) and look for solutions in the mechanisms and resources of the Ε@@ U .
the connection between drug trafficking and the funding of so @-@ called terrorism gives arguments to imperi@@ alist pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da and is becoming an ali@@ b@@ i before the people .
we do not demonstrate any toler@@ ance of the drug culture .
the reasons for drug add@@ ic@@ tion cannot be divid@@ ed into &apos; hard &apos; and &apos; so@@ ft &apos; .
preven@@ tive and ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic measures and measures to re@@ integra@@ te users are needed , together with a movement which will fight to over@@ turn the social causes and the bar@@ bar@@ ic policy of cap@@ ita@@ lis@@ m which lead@@ s to drugs .
that conclu@@ des the explan@@ ations of vote .
the sitting is suspen@@ ded .
Madam President , I would like to make a personal statement pursu@@ ant to the provisions of Rule 14@@ 5 .
in view of the fact that a Member of the European Parliament has been gro@@ ss@@ ly in@@ sul@@ ted , I have submitted a request to the President of the European Parliament to conduct an en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into information , which has been deliber@@ ately cir@@ cula@@ ted in my country , Lat@@ via , concerning my activities here at the European Parliament .
an employe@@ e at the Green Group sec@@ re@@ tari@@ at has s@@ pread this fal@@ se information .
he has vo@@ ic@@ ed the opinion in mass media pub@@ lic@@ ations that my activities ar@@ ou@@ sed such in@@ dign@@ ation amongst Members of the European Parliament that , in prote@@ st against me and my personal views , they left the Chamber .
this person described my accounts of my activities at the European Parliament as lies .
Madam President , n@@ one of this information is true .
I therefore request the lead@@ ership of the European Parliament to investi@@ g@@ ate this inc@@ ident and to re@@ ins@@ ta@@ te the truth about my European Parliament activities .
a Member of the European Parliament &apos;s job and duty is to work in the common interests of European democracy , truth and development .
every employe@@ e has these same du@@ ties regar@@ d@@ less of their political con@@ vic@@ tions .
s@@ pre@@ ading lies or allowing them to be s@@ pread not only fail@@ s to promote the principle of leg@@ ality , human rights and justice , but also dis@@ cre@@ d@@ its the European Parliament and its Members .
this cannot be per@@ mitted .
I request an investi@@ gation of these inc@@ idents .
thank you , Mr K@@ ris@@ to@@ v@@ s@@ k@@ is , for this personal statement .
the parliamentary services will investi@@ g@@ ate the matter you have raised and as@@ certain whether it is appropriate to laun@@ ch an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
- The next item is the report ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 6@@ 5 / 2004 ) by Mr Van Or@@ den on Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s progress towards accession ( COM ( 2004 ) 0@@ 6@@ 5@@ 7 - C@@ 6 @-@ 01@@ 50 / 2004 - 2004 / 2@@ 18@@ 3 ( IN@@ I ) ) .
. Madam President , it is almost n@@ ine years to the day since Bulgar@@ ia form@@ ally applied for membership of the European Union .
since then the country has under@@ gone tre@@ mend@@ ous political and economic changes : it bec@@ a@@ me a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
I see no significant obstacles to this and I trust that the European Council , when it meet@@ s at the end of this week , will not only endorse this view but also set a date early in the new year for sig@@ nature of the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty .
Bulgar@@ ia must be jud@@ ged on its own mer@@ its and its progress should not necess@@ arily be linked to that of any other candidate country .
that is why a separate A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty for Bulgar@@ ia may be necessary .
let us look at some of the changes that have taken place in Bulgar@@ ia .
on the one hand we can recognise that the accession criteria and dead@@ lines set by the European Commission have provided an external ca@@ tal@@ ys@@ t for change .
however , on the other hand , internal dyna@@ m@@ ics have gre@@ atly al@@ tered the political and social lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e in Bulgar@@ ia as it c@@ ast off its old man@@ t@@ le following the coll@@ ap@@ se of commun@@ ism in 199@@ 0 .
these changes are taking place not just because the European Union is ins@@ is@@ ting on them , but because they are good for Bulgar@@ ia and they are what the Bulgar@@ ians themselves want .
Bulgar@@ ia is now a fully functioning market economy and has been recognised as such since 2002 .
ma@@ cro@@ economic stability has been maintained , including adequate price stability and sustainable public finan@@ ces and external accounts .
to take just a cou@@ ple of key economic indic@@ ators , Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s G@@ DP gre@@ w by 6 per cent in the first quar@@ ter of 2004 , up from 4@@ .@@ 3 per cent in 2003 , and one of the highest rates among EU candid@@ ates and new Member States .
the unemployment rate has consisten@@ tly fall@@ en since 2002 : at 12 per cent it is still too high , but it is fall@@ ing .
foreign direct investment is at record levels this year .
enormous progress has also been made on priva@@ tis@@ ation : 80 per cent of the economy is now in the private sector .
I strongly support the ongoing reform of Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s public administration , with the adoption of amendments to the C@@ i@@ vil Ser@@ vice law .
improvements have also been made in the judicial system : there have been positive developments with regard to the rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment and ap@@ poin@@ tment of jud@@ ges .
however , more needs to be done , in particular in relation to pre @-@ trial procedures and the position of the Pro@@ secu@@ tor General .
however , it is not now just pla@@ in sa@@ il@@ ing .
there are still areas of concern that I have been highli@@ ghting since 1999 .
organised crime and cor@@ ruption are an obsta@@ cle to reform in Bulgar@@ ia , having kno@@ ck @-@ on effects in all sectors of the economy and society .
I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resources to be tar@@ ge@@ ted to bring about major improvements in the welfare of children and in chil@@ d@@ care institutions .
I have called for a well @-@ res@@ our@@ ced , single government agency , with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens .
the same strategic approach must be adopted for the integration of the Rom@@ a community into Bulgar@@ ian society .
Bulgar@@ ia , assis@@ ted by the European Commission , must make an even more determined effort to ex@@ pe@@ d@@ ite the integration of Rom@@ a into ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am society , particularly through edu@@ ca@@ tional and employment opportunities , improved living conditions and access to heal@@ th@@ care and family planning .
there is also another side to this problem : the Rom@@ a themselves must adap@@ t .
this point may be un@@ pop@@ ular in some cir@@ cles but it is the only way that real change will be brought about on the ground for the Rom@@ a .
over the past four years over EUR 1@@ 60 million of Community funds have been direc@@ ted at Rom@@ a issues .
however , change must happen from the in@@ side as well as on the part of government .
the European Union &apos;s enlargement to the e@@ ast and s@@ outh @-@ e@@ ast mar@@ ks a mom@@ ent@@ ous change in Europe .
we have finally put an end to the h@@ os@@ til@@ ities and the div@@ isions of the C@@ old W@@ ar .
history is being written as we speak - in Ukraine , for instance - and this morning Parliament gave its gre@@ en light to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey .
great changes are taking place on our continent .
we are in a time of trans@@ ition and we must all work hard to ensure that the ti@@ de of change shi@@ f@@ ts in the right direction .
within Europe this means ref@@ oc@@ using the nature and objectives of the European Union .
this means the EU doing less but doing it better .
I wish to thank colleagues across Parliament for their support and assistance in my work as rapporteur .
there will be an opportunity for a more comprehensive report on Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s accession early in the new year .
my report this time is deliber@@ ately conc@@ ise .
some amendments were included during the committee stage , but I do not feel that I can support any of the amendments now proposed .
finally , I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the p@@ light of Bulgar@@ ian n@@ ur@@ ses inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated in Li@@ by@@ a and now under threat of the death penalty .
I urge all Members to sign W@@ r@@ it@@ ten Dec@@ lar@@ ation No 6@@ 1 calling for their early rele@@ ase .
Bulgar@@ ia knows the challenges that li@@ e ahead .
on 17 December I trust the European Council will form@@ ally conclude Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s negotiations and set the date for sig@@ nature of the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty in s@@ pring 2005 .
this will be a great achiev@@ ement , but reform and change must continue both in Bulgar@@ ia and in the EU itself .
. Madam President , it is a great ple@@ asure to be able to inform you form@@ ally that on 13 December 2004 the General Affairs Council closed the negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia .
we will now start the last , very important phase before enter@@ ing the EU .
the remain@@ ing two years should be used to prepare thorou@@ gh@@ ly for membership .
the EU congratula@@ tes Bulgar@@ ia on this positive result , which has taken much effort and energy .
it is a new step towards a truly re@@ united Europe , based on mu@@ tually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law .
the negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia closed at the technical level in June 2004 .
this reflec@@ ts the progress that the Bulgar@@ ian Government has made in recent years , which resul@@ ted in strong confidence on the part of all those involved and the ability to assu@@ me all membership obligations by January 2007 .
still , as the Committee on Foreign Affairs also states clearly in its motion for an E@@ P resolution on Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s progress towards accession , we should closely monitor the progress which still has to be made by Bulgar@@ ia .
the commitments made in the Justice and Home Affairs c@@ hap@@ ter might need an amendment of the Constitution , which is a long and difficult process .
other important areas , as the Committee on Foreign Affairs states , are the quality of border management , the fight against cor@@ ruption , and the prevention of abuse of powers by State authorities against persons enter@@ ing or tr@@ an@@ sit@@ ing Bulgar@@ ia .
the new pen@@ al co@@ de still has to be approved .
administrative capacity in a number of areas , including the agencies involved with the use of pre @-@ accession funds , should improve .
both in Bulgar@@ ia and in Romania , improvements in the standard of living should be a priority .
the economic growth that Bulgar@@ ia and Romania have seen in recent years has had a positive effect on pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power , but the effects at g@@ ras@@ s @-@ ro@@ ots level , especially for the el@@ der@@ ly , have remain@@ ed limited .
there are at least two more years to go before accession .
an historic step will be made on 17 December when the negotiations regarding the fif@@ th enlargement have come to an end .
monitoring of the last part of the fif@@ th enlargement will continue until 2007 , in order to welcome the two new , long @-@ a@@ wa@@ ited members then ready to join the European Union .
as Mrs K@@ une@@ va said in October , she would like to publis@@ h the Mon@@ itoring Re@@ port on a big w@@ all in S@@ of@@ ia in order to keep the process going .
I think Bulgar@@ ia has made good progress , which gives us confidence for the numerous tasks still remain@@ ing .
the Council loo@@ ks forward to the fin@@ alisation of the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty with a view to its sig@@ nature in s@@ pring 2005 , after the Treaty has been submitted to the European Parliament .
.
Madam President , we have come a long way since Bulgar@@ ia applied for EU membership in 1995 and open@@ ed its negotiations in 2000 .
yesterday the EU fin@@ alised the accession negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia in the accession conference , with a view to accession on 1 January 2007 and with the sig@@ nature of the accession Treaty in si@@ ght in the s@@ pring of next year .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constan@@ t and balanced support for Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s amb@@ ition to acc@@ ed@@ e to the European Union and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Van Or@@ den , for the sound and even @-@ han@@ ded report he has produced .
in the past few years Bulgar@@ ia has made ste@@ ad@@ y progress in all areas in its prepar@@ ation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria .
important and necessary decisions have been taken in this respect .
four un@@ its of the K@@ o@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y nuclear power pl@@ ant are being closed on agreed da@@ tes for final dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing , show@@ ing Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s determination to respect commitments .
substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts .
overall , Bulgar@@ ia has consolid@@ ated and deep@@ ened the stability of its institutions .
contin@@ uation on its current reform path should enable the country to c@@ ope with competitive pres@@ su@@ res and market forces within the European Union .
we will , however , need to keep a close w@@ at@@ ch on some areas .
our intention now is to inten@@ si@@ fy our monitoring of the commitments that have been made and of continuing prepar@@ ations in general , in order to ensure that progress continues after the clos@@ ure of negotiations and that Bulgar@@ ia will be effectively ready for membership in 2007 .
in this regard , sol@@ id efforts remain necessary concerning the reform of the judic@@ i@@ ary , the fight against organised crime and the fight against cor@@ ruption .
Bulgar@@ ia has made progress in gradu@@ ally building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas .
as from November 2005 the Commission will issue ye@@ arly comprehensive monitoring reports for the Council and Parliament following the same meth@@ od@@ ology as was applied to the new Member States that join@@ ed the Union in May 2004 .
these reports will focus particularly on public administration , the judic@@ i@@ ary and the fight against cor@@ ruption , as well as the tra@@ ck record in economic reforms .
it is also necessary to take account of a longer period between comple@@ tion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous wa@@ ves of accession .
a specific safeguard was agreed , which allows the Commission to recommen@@ d to the Council to decide by unanim@@ ity , at any time , to post@@ p@@ one the date of accession by one year to January 200@@ 8 if there is clear evidence that Bulgar@@ ia is man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tly un@@ prepared .
let me conclude by saying that I share the conclusions of the report of your rapporteur , Mr Van Or@@ den , which are , by and large , in line with the 2004 reg@@ ular report .
the Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s progress towards accession .
Bulgar@@ ia is on tra@@ ck for accession on 1 January 2007 .
with the accession of Bulgar@@ ia and Romania , the fif@@ th round of EU enlargement will be concluded .
thus the B@@ lack Se@@ a will become a new coas@@ t@@ line for an enlarged and uni@@ fied Europe .
.
Madam President , as draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , I would like to begin by poin@@ ting out that the financial pre @-@ accession aid granted to Bulgar@@ ia during 2000 @-@ 2004 has amoun@@ ted to appro@@ xim@@ ately EUR 17@@ 8 million per year from the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E Programme , SA@@ P@@ A@@ R@@ D and the I@@ S@@ P@@ A instrument .
the Committee on Budgets also supports an additional su@@ m from the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E Programme of EUR 200 million for 2000 @-@ 2006 for the clos@@ ure of the K@@ o@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y nuclear power sta@@ tion .
it is also pleased that in S@@ pring 2004 a new funding framework was established for Bulgar@@ ia and that the Commission has adopted a consistent approach by restric@@ ting the aid package to a period of three years from the accession of Bulgar@@ ia in 2007 so that we can adap@@ t it to any future reforms of policies which may be necessary as a result of the new financial perspec@@ tives .
the Committee on Budgets stres@@ ses once again that financial aid will depen@@ d on the new financial perspec@@ tives , but also on the adap@@ tation of the annual Budget , in accordance with those financial perspec@@ tives .
. Madam President , un@@ like Turkey , Bulgar@@ ia is quite clearly a European country which has made tre@@ mend@@ ous progress .
I was in Bulgar@@ ia in 199@@ 0 , when the country first attemp@@ ted to hold free elections .
there was still some election @-@ ri@@ gg@@ ing , but the democracy movement was im@@ pres@@ sive .
in many ways , it was re@@ minis@@ cent of the current situation in Ukraine .
Bulgar@@ ia has succ@@ eeded , step by step , in over@@ coming these crisis situations , and must now be taken seriously as a very promis@@ ing candidate for accession to the European Union .
it has a rich culture and exer@@ ts a major sta@@ bil@@ ising influence over the entire Bal@@ kan pen@@ in@@ sul@@ a .
although there is still a great deal to do - especially on the rule of law , justice and administration , where further reforms are required - Bulgar@@ ia is by far the most advan@@ ced of all the candidate countries , unless , that is , we forget a country which we should never forget , namely C@@ roati@@ a .
I would like to take this opportunity to appeal also to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council to accept C@@ roati@@ a at the forthcoming summit without any pre@@ var@@ ication or special conditions , and to make mas@@ sive efforts to ensure that the negotiations with C@@ roati@@ a are open@@ ed without delay .
both these countries should become members of the European Union before the dec@@ ade is out , and Mr Van Or@@ den &apos;s excellent report makes a major contribution to this process .
one of Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s particular achiev@@ ements is the cross @-@ party cooperation established between Prime Minister Sa@@ x@@ e @-@ C@@ ob@@ ur@@ g @-@ Go@@ th@@ a and the Bulgar@@ ian President , which is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite enab@@ ling Bulgar@@ ia to bring its progress towards EU membership to a successful conclusion in the coming years .
Bulgar@@ ia enjo@@ ys democratic stability at domestic level and is remain@@ ing resolu@@ te despite the cris@@ es affec@@ ting a number of areas , including the economy .
I would like to say how gra@@ ti@@ fied I am by this development , and that Bulgar@@ ia is well on tra@@ ck .
I could su@@ m up my speech in a single word : &apos; yes &quot; to Bulgar@@ ia .
. I would like to congratulate Mr van Or@@ den on his out@@ standing report , which I believe is the fru@@ it of much hard work , and I would like to thank the Commission &apos;s excellent work done with regard to candidate countries .
techn@@ ically , Bulgar@@ ia has comple@@ ted all the accession negoti@@ ation c@@ hap@@ ters and is clearly head@@ ed towards becoming a full member of the European Union in January 2007 .
according to the report , Bulgar@@ ia continues to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and the measures taken to success@@ fully implement them have been effective .
however , this report also emphas@@ ises that there are still defic@@ i@@ encies that will ine@@ vi@@ tably have to be dealt with .
we believe that Bulgar@@ ia is on tra@@ ck for accession and will continue to make efforts to complete success@@ fully the reforms it committed itself to in the ne@@ ar future .
these mainly include judicial reform and further increased efforts to counter organised crime and cor@@ ruption .
the report wel@@ comes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights , as a result of which the so @-@ called legislation on anti @-@ discrimination was adopted on January 1 , 2004 .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of the legisla@@ ture &apos;s practical extension , as discrimination against Rom@@ any people remains wid@@ es@@ pread there .
the report acknowled@@ ges Bulgar@@ ia meeting the economic criteria and no@@ tes that it is a functioning market economy and at the time of accession will be able to c@@ ope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union .
the European Parliament and the Soci@@ alist Group will continue the monitoring system while ensuring that operations are run effici@@ ently and obligations are fulfi@@ lled .
based on Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s reform efforts and progress , the Soci@@ alist Group hop@@ es that Bulgar@@ ia will sign and rati@@ fy the accession treaty as soon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 2007 .
.
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , my group also views Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s progress towards accession as a success s@@ tory , al@@ be@@ it with a few necessary ca@@ ve@@ ats on points of detail .
we therefore believe that this House can vote in favour of Bulgar@@ ia accession to the European Union in 2007 with a clear con@@ sci@@ ence .
we support Mr Van Or@@ den &apos;s report and speaking personally , I would like to thank him and Mrs D@@ ob@@ ol@@ y@@ i from the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament for the good cooperation .
as Mr Van Or@@ den himself has said , he has deliber@@ ately kept the report brief .
I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments , some of which are very detailed , next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due .
Bulgar@@ ia is well on tra@@ ck to join the European Union in 2007 .
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight a fundamental problem , namely that of genuine compliance with the principle of mer@@ it .
the Commission and the Council have both stated that each candidate &apos;s accession should be based on individual mer@@ it .
however , this is in@@ compatible with a situation in which a candidate country which ful@@ f@@ ils the criteria is held back by the s@@ lower progress made by other countries .
the countries making s@@ wi@@ f@@ ter progress thus acc@@ ed@@ e too late while the candid@@ ates making s@@ lower progress join too early .
to put it simply , the good per@@ form@@ ers are being pen@@ alised while the la@@ gg@@ ards are being re@@ war@@ ded .
this situation must change .
the credibility of the Union as a whole is dama@@ ged if its practices conflict with the principle of mer@@ it .
Commissioner Verheugen am@@ ply demonstrated this with the &apos; big ban@@ g &apos; enlargement in May this year , which dama@@ ged the Union .
a better option would have been for well @-@ per@@ form@@ ing candid@@ ates , such as E@@ st@@ onia and Slo@@ ven@@ ia , to have been able to join much earlier .
for this reason alone , namely to preser@@ ve the European Union &apos;s credibility and not because there is any doubt about the European pros@@ pect of either of the two candid@@ ates , my group has always been in favour of separate accession tre@@ aties for Bulgar@@ ia and Romania .
Mr Wat@@ son re@@ aff@@ ir@@ med this position this morning in this Chamber .
I therefore urge the Commission and the Council , but also my fellow Members in this House , to ensure , during present and future enlargement ro@@ unds , that the principle of mer@@ it is not just proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed with p@@ om@@ p and cer@@ em@@ on@@ y , only to be ig@@ no@@ red in favour of package de@@ als , but is actually implemented in practice .
in this context , a gra@@ ti@@ fying sign is the Council &apos;s decision to adopt differ@@ enti@@ ated appro@@ ac@@ hes to Bulgar@@ ia and Romania in the c@@ hap@@ ters on competition and justice .
simp@@ lif@@ ying the mechanism to invo@@ ke the safeguard clause in the case of Romania will enhan@@ ce the credibility of the accession process and thus the credibility of the European Union itself .
on a more general note , I believe that we should be conduc@@ ting this debate not in Strasbourg , but in Brussels .
. Madam President , Bulgar@@ ia will become a Member State with many un@@ resolved issues .
old environmental problems , resul@@ ting from min@@ ing and nuclear waste , are still left un@@ resolved .
much damage is being done by construction work for new ro@@ ads through protected sc@@ en@@ ic areas and by the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the larg@@ est air@@ port .
these days , poor main@@ ten@@ ance , dec@@ ay and poverty are no@@ tic@@ e@@ able throughout Bulgar@@ ia .
the Rom@@ a people are still la@@ gg@@ ing behind and dis@@ advanta@@ ged .
EU funding for the benefit of projects for this group of people is divid@@ ed and spent in a con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous manner .
in the min@@ ds of many Bulgar@@ ians , the ne@@ ar@@ by Greek and R@@ oman coas@@ ts bel@@ ong , in fact , to Bulgar@@ ia , just as do the greater part of the Republic of Maced@@ onia and a few areas on the border with Ser@@ bia .
the fact that the Bulgar@@ ian elector@@ ate still has not made any ste@@ ad@@ y cho@@ ices is appar@@ ent from the rapid changes within the two main ri@@ vall@@ ing political parties , and , above all , from the fact that a new@@ com@@ er to the most recent general elections achieved almost the majority of the votes .
shor@@ tly after the surpris@@ ing election as Prime Minister of the country &apos;s former K@@ ing , the candidate of the Commun@@ ists &quot; success@@ ors was elected President .
this ins@@ tability has , however , produced one positive development in the form of greater involvement in political decision @-@ making of the Turkish minority , which was discrimin@@ ated against in the past .
un@@ like in Romania , the problems in Bulgar@@ ia are no b@@ ig@@ ger than those in a number of the present EU Member States .
that is why it is right to allow Bulgar@@ ia full EU membership from 2007 .
there is a strong histor@@ ical and l@@ ing@@ uis@@ tic b@@ ond between Bulgar@@ ia and the S@@ la@@ v@@ on@@ ic @-@ speaking part of Maced@@ onia .
in 18@@ 7@@ 8 , last @-@ minu@@ te W@@ estern European intervention preven@@ ted the two from un@@ iting .
it would be useful if the negotiations about Maced@@ onia &apos;s accession - for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has ap@@ pointed me as rapporteur - were to run par@@ all@@ el with C@@ roati@@ a , which also has its ro@@ ots in former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via , so that we can welcome the Bulgar@@ ians and Maced@@ on@@ ians to the European Union si@@ mul@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously .
- Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope Mr Pos@@ sel@@ t will p@@ raise me as well shor@@ tly .
I am not over@@ ly keen on the b@@ lack @-@ and @-@ wh@@ ite fil@@ m presented by the European Commission entitled &apos; Romania the bad and Bulgar@@ ia the good . &quot;
b@@ lack @-@ and @-@ wh@@ ite fil@@ ms are not pop@@ ular either in politics or in real life .
not everything is as bad in Romania and as good in Bulgar@@ ia as would appear from the pic@@ ture pain@@ ted by the European Commission &apos;s a@@ ma@@ te@@ ur ar@@ tis@@ ts .
it is true that Bulgar@@ ia has made progress and that it should join the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
at the same time , however , Bulgar@@ ia has not done many of the things it should have done .
I should like to refer to a number of specific points .
firstly , what use is there in Bulgar@@ ian legislation compl@@ ying with EU legislation , if implementation of this legislation continues to la@@ g behind ?
secondly , trade in human beings , in particular in women and children , is still a serious problem .
as a third point , the adoption system and its lack of transparency , as well as the situation in Bulgar@@ ian or@@ p@@ han@@ ages and special scho@@ ols , continue to be a cause for concern .
four@@ th@@ ly , there are also concerns with regard to the situation of ad@@ ul@@ ts in p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c h@@ os@@ pi@@ tal@@ s , and this is included in Parliament &apos;s motion for a resolution .
as a fif@@ th point , the continuing lack of reform of the judicial system , which la@@ gs a long way behind European standards , is an A@@ ch@@ ill@@ es &quot; he@@ el for S@@ of@@ ia .
the si@@ x@@ th point I should like to refer to is the wid@@ es@@ pread cor@@ ruption , which is a th@@ or@@ n in Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s side as it en@@ ters the EU , given that it affec@@ ts various areas and levels of government and is appar@@ ent at every turn .
during the past few weeks I have visi@@ ted Bulgar@@ ia tw@@ ice , and my remarks are by no means merely quo@@ tes from reports , but reflect what is pla@@ in for everyone to see .
the se@@ v@@ ent@@ h point is organised crime .
the Bulgar@@ ian Government is ac@@ ting like the cho@@ ir in a C@@ hin@@ ese oper@@ a , where the cho@@ ir s@@ ings &apos; let &apos;s run away , let &apos;s run away &quot; for three acts , but sta@@ ys in the same place the whole time .
the Bulgar@@ ian Government constantly repe@@ ats that it is taking measures to fight the ma@@ f@@ ia , but it would appear that it is mainly conduc@@ ting a war of words .
the ma@@ f@@ ia continues to be a serious problem .
at the same time , however , the EU also sometimes takes measures that the Bulgar@@ ian public fin@@ ds in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
for example , it recently deman@@ ded that a power pl@@ ant in K@@ o@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ j be sh@@ ut down , even though enormous amounts of Bulgar@@ ian tax@@ pay@@ ers &quot; money had been spent on modern@@ ising it in recent years .
in conclusion , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , despite these reser@@ vations we should welcome the fact that our European family is to be join@@ ed by a nation with a history d@@ ating back over 13@@ 00 years .
Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s history is longer than many of the present EU Member States .
I should like to b@@ id Bulgar@@ ia welcome to some@@ where it should have been for many years .
I am sure Bulgar@@ ia will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of hom@@ el@@ an@@ ds .
- Madam President , I should like by way of introduction to make the members of the European Parliament pri@@ v@@ y to the h@@ osta@@ ge @-@ taking in A@@ th@@ ens today , to the hi@@ j@@ ac@@ king of a b@@ us with inno@@ cent citizens on their way to work .
I mention this in order to highlight the need to for@@ mu@@ late an efficient policy at European level on ur@@ ban security .
now to the subject in hand .
Bulgar@@ ia made no@@ te@@ wor@@ thy progress in conver@@ ting to a pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic democracy and func@@ tional market economy in keeping with European ins@@ truc@@ tions at both political and economic level .
the integration of Bulgar@@ ia into the European Union in 2007 , in con@@ jun@@ ction with its recent ad@@ mission to Ν@@ Α@@ Τ@@ Ο , is a particularly positive development both for Bulgar@@ ia itself and for s@@ outh @-@ eas@@ tern Europe as a whole .
I trust that the case of Bulgar@@ ia will also set an example for the countries of the W@@ estern Balkans as they move towards Europe .
nonetheless , it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constan@@ t and con@@ sci@@ ous effort on the part of the Bulgar@@ ian authorities to adap@@ t pen@@ ding full integration .
further efforts should focus on sta@@ mp@@ ing out cor@@ ruption and effici@@ ently combating organised crime .
I should like at this point to call on the European Commission , within the framework of the Community policy on border regions with candidate countries , to draft a new study on the re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions which the integration of Bulgar@@ ia and Romania will have on the border regions of the Member States .
I would remind you in this context that the European Commission itself , in the person of the competent Commissioner , Mr Verheugen , found that regions such as nor@@ th @-@ eas@@ tern Greece , which border on two countries , face by far the most difficult situation at European level .
the policies and actions of the European Union to promote tr@@ ans @-@ national , tr@@ ans @-@ regional and cross @-@ border cooperation and to combat the re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinfor@@ ced .
si@@ mil@@ arly , special care must be taken when distribu@@ ting resources and preparing programmes for territor@@ ial cooperation in the new 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 program@@ ming period .
Madam President , it is the case that Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s capacity to comply with the Community has increased consider@@ ably and is continuing to do so .
nevertheless , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy wishes to stress that in the sectors of research and development , energy , industrial policy and tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ications policy an additional effort is required if we want the incorpor@@ ation of Bulgar@@ ia to be an historic success , since the accession date is now getting very close .
furthermore , in order correc@@ tly to ass@@ ess the progress made and thereby propose the changes still to be made , we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission , but also of the assess@@ ments of the different international bodies and other independent research c@@ ent@@ res , whose opinion may be of great assistance in analys@@ ing and evalu@@ ating Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s capacity in these areas , with a view to its incorpor@@ ation into the European Union .
in any event , our current views with regard to each of the sectors which are the responsibility of our committee are as follows : with regard to energy policy , Bulgar@@ ia - as has already been said - currently depen@@ ds on nuclear energy to cover its internal needs , but the reality is that its nuclear power sta@@ tions are techn@@ ically ob@@ sol@@ ete and the dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of some of them has been very expen@@ sive .
as has also been pointed out , it is now proposed to modern@@ ise un@@ its 5 and 6 of the K@@ o@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y power sta@@ tion , and additional funds will be required for this , since the European Union &apos;s contributions are clearly in@@ sufficient .
funds from international don@@ ors are required , though we are not seeing the government prior@@ it@@ ise this issue as it should do .
in the tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ications sector , the independence of the regulatory authority should be guaranteed , and it should have the power to resolve commercial dispu@@ tes and guarantee the principle of univers@@ ality , in accordance with Community legislation .
it is also necessary to re@@ for@@ mu@@ late industrial and business policy and improve the administrative capacity to facilitate the work of small and medium @-@ sized businesses , which are the true cre@@ ators of jobs and an extra@@ ordinary source of technolog@@ ical innovation .
with regard to the research sector , despite Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s participation in the S@@ i@@ x@@ th Fra@@ mework Programme , its presence has been very limited .
Madam President , this is essentially the content of the amendment our committee is pres@@ enting to the report we are deb@@ ating .
- Madam President , Minister , Commissioner , congratula@@ tions to the rapporteur and congratula@@ tions to Bulgar@@ ia as well .
it has closed all the c@@ hap@@ ters and is an example and an ins@@ pi@@ ration to all its neighbours .
I repeat , to all its neighbours .
it would be an even better example if it took just one more step in its relationship with its minorities and did the same for the other minorities living in Bulgar@@ ia as it has already done for the Turkish minority . &apos; the Balkans , that an@@ ci@@ ent moun@@ tain range , &quot; as the Bulgar@@ ian national an@@ them goes , and the word &apos; Balkans &quot; as a political problem does not apply in the case of Bulgar@@ ia .
Bulgar@@ ia already bel@@ ong@@ s to W@@ estern Europe and it is the W@@ estern Balkans that we will have to deal with in the future .
this is why I feel that it is important that when we are talking about Bulgar@@ ia , we should also pay some attention to Maced@@ onia , which has already submitted its application for membership of the European Union and that the European Union itself should also take another step forward .
the USA has recognised Maced@@ onia by the name that it ch@@ ose for itself .
we still continue to use the name F@@ Y@@ R@@ OM and it is high time we took another step forward because this would also be a great step towards the Europe@@ an@@ isation of this area .
in an h@@ our and a half &apos;s time , Commissioner , you will be meeting a delegation from Ser@@ bia and Mon@@ te@@ ne@@ gr@@ o .
this is the delegation &apos;s first visit to the European Parliament and I believe that the example of Bulgar@@ ia should be used as an ins@@ pi@@ ration for all its neighbours to do more for the future pros@@ pects and stability of this part of the world .
therefore it seems to me that we could all learn more from Bulgar@@ ia and that Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s princi@@ p@@ al neigh@@ bour could learn a lot .
I am talking about Turkey , a country we have supported today in saying &apos; yes &quot; to the start of negotiations .
Bulgar@@ ia is the last country on the road to Turkey and I believe that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to per@@ form in this respect , should support all of these countries so that they can participate fully both econom@@ ically and politically and bring about a further enlargement of the European Union .
-@@ Madam President , both the resolutions and opinions of the Commission and the Council giving the go @-@ ahead for the integration of Bulgar@@ ia and Romania in future years clearly set out the objectives of European capital , which are already being realis@@ ed , to anne@@ x these countries , pl@@ under their we@@ alth and their economy , explo@@ it their workers to an un@@ beli@@ e@@ va@@ ble degree and conver@@ t them to NATO sa@@ tell@@ ite@@ s , so that they can serve its ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive policy .
the resolutions record , to a degree , certain aspects of the w@@ ret@@ ched and in@@ human@@ e living conditions of the working cl@@ ass@@ es in these countries and the poor g@@ ras@@ s @-@ ro@@ ots cl@@ ass@@ es , but these are the result of the restor@@ ation of cap@@ ita@@ lis@@ m , which is ero@@ ding all the social rights achieved and , on the other hand , is concentra@@ ting we@@ alth in the hands of a new plu@@ to@@ c@@ racy and foreign monopol@@ ies .
there are in fact two Bulgar@@ i@@ as and two Roman@@ i@@ as : on the one hand , the countries of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y for the new plu@@ to@@ c@@ rats in Bulgar@@ ia and Romania and the fore@@ ig@@ ners who are li@@ ter@@ ally pl@@ under@@ ing these countries and , on the other , the countries of two pro@@ ud nations li@@ ter@@ ally being dra@@ g@@ ged into mis@@ er@@ y and hu@@ mili@@ ation .
the consequences of the integration process and of the hu@@ mili@@ ating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visi@@ ble .
you spoke to us of succ@@ esses .
so lis@@ ten to the succ@@ esses : in Bulgar@@ ia , the minimum w@@ age is EUR 6@@ 1 and in Romania it is EUR 6@@ 9 , compared with EUR 1.@@ 17@@ 3 in France and EUR 6@@ 0@@ 5 in Greece .
the rapid increase in impor@@ ts , in con@@ jun@@ ction with plu@@ m@@ met@@ ing exports , has resul@@ ted in increased defic@@ its .
pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power in Romania is 60 % of what it was in 198@@ 9 .
industry has been destro@@ yed and agricultural production is operating bel@@ ow pa@@ r .
the objective of the new direction proposed in the resolutions and the new measures is to create better conditions , an institutional framework and infrastruc@@ tures for the most un@@ accoun@@ table action by capital , the complete sell@@ ing off of public proper@@ ty and land and the abol@@ ition of any social rights achieved .
the workers in these countries , together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe , must fight against the policy of the European Union and , more importan@@ tly , against the new ten@@ sions expected in the area as a result of the serious ri@@ val@@ ry which is beginning to man@@ i@@ f@@ est itself .
Madam President , this debate is , actually , a to@@ ken of con@@ gra@@ tu@@ lation to Bulgar@@ ia , although it goes without saying that it still has many problems , and much remains to be dealt with .
a great deal , of course , still needs to be done in the field of human rights and human trafficking , but they are doing their level best , which was not ev@@ ident before .
it is for that reason that I believe that Bulgar@@ ia should be able to join the European Union in 2007 .
they bel@@ ong among us .
I would also like to see more attention given to a debate about Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s accession than to one about Turkey &apos;s .
after all , Bulgar@@ ia is a truly European country , stra@@ d@@ d@@ ling the old and new Europe , and deser@@ ves all our attention .
I can fores@@ ee some problems with regard to its accession .
while there are , of course , problems in Bulgar@@ ia itself , the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est may well be in the European Union .
the fact is that funding for its accession is not yet completely in place .
after 2007 , we will be talking about the financial perspective up to 20@@ 13 , and I am surpris@@ ed at the discussion that is being held in the Council and elsewhere , in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1 % of the gro@@ s@@ s domestic product .
if you look at all the fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ts that have been made , funding for Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s accession is no@@ where to be found .
I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission , which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1 % .
if , however , we look at the proposals for agriculture , for example , we no@@ tice that those do not include a budget for agriculture in Bulgar@@ ia , while the development of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side in Bulgar@@ ia will play a key role in the development of that country itself .
anyone who lo@@ ves the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , lo@@ ves the country itself and actually does something for the future of that country .
I am therefore interested to hear how the Council intends to fund this accession and how we can ensure in a correct and proper manner that Bulgar@@ ia becomes a truly European country in 2007 .
I should like to fin@@ ish off with another point .
in the respon@@ ses by the Con@@ feder@@ al Group of the United L@@ ef@@ t / Nor@@ di@@ c Green L@@ ef@@ t - which does , after all , comp@@ rise quite a few former Commun@@ ists - I was struc@@ k by the fact that people have some difficul@@ ty with the major political changes in Bulgar@@ ia .
to those people , I have this to say .
the Bulgar@@ ians have a better g@@ ras@@ p of politics than your group , and do you know why ?
they jud@@ ge politicians by their actions , which may lead to major shi@@ f@@ ts .
I am pleased to see that the Bulgar@@ ians , in terms of democratic thinking , are further advan@@ ced than many Members from the G@@ U@@ E / NG@@ L Group .
- Madam President , I should like , now that accession negotiations have been concluded with Bulgar@@ ia , for us to start by highli@@ ghting and wel@@ coming the huge efforts made by the Bulgar@@ ian people and the political forces in the country to pus@@ h ahead with changes and reforms and incorpor@@ ate the .
the accession of Bulgar@@ ia and Romania will close the cir@@ cle of enlargement open@@ ed with the ten new countries .
it is a development of strategic importance which uni@@ tes the Balkans and Europe and will contribute to peace , stability , cooperation and development in the area as a whole .
however , I should like to under@@ line a number of crucial points both to the Commission and to the Presidency .
during the next stage , Bulgar@@ ia will need to step up its efforts to apply the in four sectors which are of particular importance to the European Union and to Greece :
the first is the sector of environmental protection , nuclear safety , nuclear waste management and the quality of ri@@ ver water .
reac@@ tors 3 and 4 at the K@@ o@@ z@@ lo@@ du@@ y nuclear power sta@@ tion must close in 2006 , in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgar@@ ian authorities , and modern@@ isation of nuclear ins@@ ta@@ ll@@ ations with Community financing from the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E programme and from the European Bank for R@@ ec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion and Development must continue nor@@ m@@ ally .
in the sector of labour relations and labour law , additional reforms are needed for Bulgar@@ ia to approach European standards and over@@ turn social exclusion practices which affect Community - and especially Greek - under@@ ta@@ k@@ ings in border regions , where there is a serious problem with re@@ loc@@ ations .
furthermore , defic@@ its are recor@@ ded in the three sectors of combating organised crime , trafficking in human beings and contro@@ lling external borders and combating illegal immigration .
finally , I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedures and greater transparency in the sector of public proc@@ ure@@ ment and public works are needed , as is the safe@@ guar@@ ding of equal treatment of all Community under@@ ta@@ k@@ ings , including Greek under@@ ta@@ k@@ ings .
the European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for , with annual evaluation reports and safe@@ guar@@ ding c@@ laus@@ es , to monitor closely the efficient application of the and safeguard Community interests , even after the accession of Bulgar@@ ia on 1 January 2007 .
. Madam President , I appreciate the positive remarks from Members of Parliament with regard to the accession of Bulgar@@ ia .
Mr Pos@@ sel@@ t , Mr Ma@@ at , Mrs D@@ ob@@ ol@@ y@@ i and others were clear on that issue .
Members said that there are still a lot of concerns .
that is true .
that is precisely the reason why we have the framework , the procedure , with ex@@ tra monitoring and an ex@@ tra ben@@ ch@@ mark and , if necessary , an ex@@ tra san@@ ction , an ex@@ tra safeguard for an ex@@ tra year before the moment of accession .
with regard to the financial issue raised by Mr Ma@@ at and others , I do not think we need to be concerned .
the financial consequences of accession are already covered in the so @-@ called financial package for the years 2007 @-@ 0@@ 9 .
that is ir@@ respec@@ tive of the new financial perspective .
an important issue that was raised again today is the importance of having an individual approach to different countries .
you know the for@@ mal position - one treaty for Romania and Bulgar@@ ia .
it is important , and necessary , to differ@@ enti@@ ate .
that is precisely what we want to do in the wor@@ ding of the conclusions next Th@@ urs@@ day or F@@ rid@@ ay in the Council , concentra@@ ting on the different c@@ hap@@ ters .
if necessary we can differ@@ enti@@ ate at the moment of actual accession , because there is the possibility of post@@ pon@@ ing accession for a maximum of one year .
I thank the rapporteur , Mr Van Or@@ den , for his adequate and balanced report .
I really welcome its conclusions .
. Madam President , I promis@@ e to speak s@@ low@@ ly and un@@ h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed@@ ly .
I wish to say thank you for the per@@ tin@@ ent debate and those points of view expressed which , in the main , support the Commission &apos;s recommendations .
I will respond to just a cou@@ ple of the most central issues .
I will speak first about the cou@@ pl@@ ing of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia .
it is true that a joint A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty is being draf@@ ted for these countries . on the other hand , as Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï very clearly expla@@ ined , each is being treated according to a differ@@ enti@@ ated approach , especially now the process is in its last sta@@ ges and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assess@@ ed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfi@@ lled before these countries can acc@@ ed@@ e to the Union .
I would also like to emphasise that Bulgar@@ ia is not yet ready for membership either : much work is being asked of it , but , at the same time , Bulgar@@ ia has all the potential to fulfil its commitments to enable it to acc@@ ed@@ e to the Union on 1 January 2007 .
I will speak next about cor@@ ruption , which has at@@ trac@@ ted much attention in speec@@ hes .
that is quite right and I agree with those views expressed .
Bulgar@@ ia has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against cor@@ ruption .
it is particularly concerned with improving border controls , developing the work of the traffic police and the institutions in general , and coun@@ tering cor@@ ruption in Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s administration .
this is in fact the main focus of Su@@ b @-@ Programme 4 under the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years , in 2005 and 2006 .
thirdly and finally , I wish to talk about the status of minorities , and especially that of the Rom@@ a .
in Bulgar@@ ia , new legislation against discrimination has recently been passed and has ente@@ red into force there .
it took effect in January of this year and it is pres@@ ently being implemented in con@@ jun@@ ction with an anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory action programme to improve the status of minorities .
we are very closely monitoring this new legislation and the implementation of the action programme to support it .
I am also pleased that other European organisations , such as the Council of Europe , in the building next to ours , is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Rom@@ a .
we would all certainly have been present at the opening cer@@ em@@ on@@ y of the Council of Europe &apos;s Rom@@ a For@@ um at 12 noon today , but at the same time we were deb@@ ating , and you were voting on , the very important report on Turkey , so , unfortunately , we could not get there .
I wish to thank the European Parliament for its support and coun@@ se@@ l , and I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Van Or@@ den , and Bulgar@@ ia , which h@@ ope@@ fully will become an example to the entire Bal@@ kan region .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m .
the next item is the report ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 6@@ 1 / 2004 ) by Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on Romania &apos;s progress towards accession &#91; 2004 / 2@@ 18@@ 4 ( IN@@ I ) &#93; .
I should like to inv@@ ite Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i to take the floor , and to inform him that he may speak for five minu@@ tes .
- Mr President , the political context in which I am tab@@ ling this report has become cle@@ ar@@ er in recent weeks .
last week the Commission was able to close accession negotiations with Romania on the last two c@@ hap@@ ters , namely justice and home affairs , and competition .
moreover , legislative elections and then presid@@ ential elections have also been held in recent weeks , putting a different political party in power under conditions that have been recognised by all of the parties .
this information obviously does not change the ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y and general th@@ r@@ ust of the report .
I wanted to draft and sub@@ mit a balanced report to the House , that is to say a report that was both ri@@ goro@@ us and clear , because Romania &apos;s situation poses many problems . yet I also wanted it to be a fri@@ en@@ dly report , because we all want Romania and Bulgar@@ ia to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession .
on this basis , we are proposing that we both take note of Romania &apos;s progress towards accession and also remain aware of its limits and short@@ com@@ ings , and the extent of the work that remains to be done .
these two aspects , the limits and the progress , are actually set out for each of the areas in question .
they are presented first with regard to the political criteria , and it is there without any doubt that the main difficulties li@@ e .
there are limits to the progress made ; for example , the reform of the civil service does not go far enough , the use of emergency ordin@@ an@@ ces is not des@@ ira@@ ble and quite excessive , and as for legislative procedures , everyone knows that they are not perfec@@ t .
but over and above this limited progress , a number of problems , serious problems , remain as far as freedoms are concerned .
I am thinking firstly of the freedom of information and expression , which is den@@ ied to a great many journ@@ alists .
I am thinking of the judicial system , which despite initial improvements is un@@ ques@@ tion@@ ably in need of further attention .
I am thinking , of course , of cor@@ ruption , which is still en@@ dem@@ ic in Romania , even at high levels .
on all of these problems - freedom of expression , cor@@ ruption , the judicial and police systems - I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to be absolutely un@@ compromis@@ ing .
at the same time , we cannot ignor@@ e the fact that progress has un@@ doub@@ tedly been made .
the Commission has recognised that Romania satis@@ f@@ ies the Copenhagen political criteria ; the country has embar@@ ked on public administration reform , and constitutional reform is also under@@ way .
the judicial system , as I have said , is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection - requested by our own Parliament , inc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly - even though it is possible to go further .
overall then , I believe that Romania has lis@@ tened to the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament , in particular those that were made at the ins@@ ti@@ gation of the previous rapporteur , Mrs N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son .
we find the same problem with the economic criteria : there are limits to the progress made , ma@@ cro@@ economic stability is not yet guaranteed and poverty remains at quite excessive levels .
at the same time , we have seen progress in the fight against social exclusion , in the fight against poverty and in the adoption of legislation on social protection .
the third and final area is everything to do with the .
as I said at the out@@ set , negotiations on this are complete . moreover , I do not believe that it would be wise to re@@ open them , although I have read that the new@@ ly @-@ elected presid@@ ent intends to do so .
for my part , I think that the treaty should first be rati@@ fied and signed before it is rene@@ goti@@ ated .
we need , however , to implement the legislation that has been adopted , in particular that relating to the free movement of goods and capital , financial control , the environment , industrial production , regional policy and issues of justice and home affairs .
this assessment , which I hope is balanced , is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommen@@ ding , and they are as follows : as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty - I repeat , a joint treaty - being signed for Romania and Bulgar@@ ia at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007 .
clearly this is a political decision , but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close w@@ at@@ ch on developments through all of the follow @-@ up actions and other reports that we can table here .
a final word on the amendments tabled : we did a good job , in my opinion , in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which enab@@ led the report to be adopted by a very large majority .
the remain@@ ing amendments to the report fall into two categ@@ or@@ ies .
there are those that improve the substance of the report , in particular on social protection , human rights , the disab@@ led , the protection of children and young people , and recommendations on industrial policy , and I am obviously in favour of these .
then there are other amendments that call into question the existence of a joint accession treaty or which change the nature and balance of the report , which clearly I do not support .
this morning we made the historic decision to open negotiations with Turkey .
I believe that conclu@@ ding them with Romania and Bulgar@@ ia , and with Romania in particular , is , in contr@@ ast , a log@@ ical decision , and people would not understand if we did not do both of these things together .
. Mr President , it is a great ple@@ asure for me to be able to inform you here form@@ ally that on 14 December 2004 the General Affairs Council also closed the negotiations with Romania .
as I said when referring to Bulgar@@ ia , it is a new step towards a really re@@ united Europe based on mu@@ tually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law .
I will el@@ abor@@ ate briefly on the process of clos@@ ing the last challeng@@ ing c@@ hap@@ ters with Romania and focus on the monitoring system developed to ensure a proper start for Romania within the European Union .
the two remain@@ ing c@@ hap@@ ters , which have been regar@@ ded as the most difficult ones - competition policy , and justice and home affairs - were techn@@ ically closed by the General Affairs Council on 14 December 2004 .
I believe we have been able to find appropriate solutions for all the issues raised in those final weeks through close and constructive cooperation between the Commission and the Council .
however , clos@@ ing these two c@@ hap@@ ters means that the real work continues for the Roman@@ ians .
over the next two years Romania will have to make real and sustain@@ ed efforts in order to be truly ready for membership .
good inten@@ tions are not enough : these must be mat@@ ched by progress on the ground , in particular in the implementation of commitments .
the EU will of course continue to support the prepar@@ ations at all levels : the Commission will enhan@@ ce the monitoring of progress commitments undertaken in all areas of the .
we lear@@ ned from representatives of both governments that monitoring systems help@@ ed them very much in continuing , and even inten@@ si@@ fying , the reforms needed .
on competition policy , this c@@ hap@@ ter is at the cor@@ e of the internal market and European economic integration .
the proper en@@ for@@ cement of EU competition rules is a pre@@ condition for creating a reli@@ able business environment and requires appropriate administrative capacity .
this is a long @-@ term process .
it is for those reasons that competition dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine is also a key aspect of the Europe agreement .
other key aspects are legislative al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment and the institutional and administrative structures in Romania .
what needs to be done to bring all legislation , including secon@@ d@@ ary legislation , into line with the requirements in the areas of ant@@ it@@ r@@ ust and State aid , in particular in relation to fis@@ cal aid ?
the Roman@@ ian Com@@ pet@@ ition Council should be given the powers , resources and the well @-@ tra@@ ined staff it needs to fulfil its role .
this Council should prohi@@ bit any measures which would be in contradic@@ tion with the State aid and the Europe agreement .
let me turn to the ste@@ el sector , which is a sensitive sector across the EU .
Romania has asked for a pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ation of the so @-@ called &apos; gra@@ ce period &apos; under the Europe agreement for restruc@@ turing the ste@@ el industry .
again , we only agreed to this now it is clear that Romania will ab@@ ide by all the commitments and all the conditions set out in the EU &apos;s position .
these commitments include drawing up a national restruc@@ turing programme as well as an individual business plan , capacity reduction and dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of the ins@@ ta@@ ll@@ ations .
the European Union ex@@ pects Romania to respect all its commitments and take all the necessary measures within the dead@@ lines laid down in the EU &apos;s position .
in this context , I should rec@@ all the safegu@@ ards we have at our dispos@@ al .
in October 2005 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assess@@ ing Romania &apos;s progress in the area of competition policy .
any serious short@@ com@@ ings obser@@ ved in this report regarding Romania &apos;s obligations under the Europe agreement and / or the ful@@ fil@@ ment of the commitments can form the basis for a recommendation by the Commission to invo@@ ke safegu@@ ards , in particular the one post@@ pon@@ ing Romania &apos;s accession by one year .
here the Council can decide by a qualified majority .
on this understanding , I have come to the conclusion that this c@@ hap@@ ter does not require further negotiations .
let me say that it is now in Romania &apos;s hands to ensure that it meet@@ s all its commitments in this c@@ hap@@ ter , allowing Romania &apos;s smo@@ o@@ th integration into the European Union .
turning to justice and home affairs , this is a c@@ hap@@ ter which is both exten@@ sive and complex .
it is at the heart of our objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom , security and justice .
it has a direct be@@ aring on the lives of every EU citizen , and is therefore a key part of the which must be respected .
negotiations on this c@@ hap@@ ter have been long and detailed .
Romania has made a considerable number of firm commitments on all areas of the justice and home affairs .
there are several areas to which particular attention should be paid , such as implementation of the Schengen action plan ; ensuring a high level of control and sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance at the external borders of the Union ; implementing the reform of the judic@@ i@@ ary ; ste@@ pp@@ ing up the fight against cor@@ ruption to ensure that cor@@ ruption cases are dealt with in a s@@ wi@@ ft and transparent manner ; making considerable progress in fi@@ lling the large number of va@@ can@@ cies in the police forces ; as well as developing and implementing a coherent multi@@ annual anti @-@ crime strategy .
these issues have also been addressed in Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i &apos;s report on Romania .
the Union will closely monitor Romania &apos;s implementation of all its commitments related to justice and home affairs , right up to the moment of accession in order to meet EU standards .
this includes ad@@ her@@ ing to the planned legislative sch@@ edu@@ le and taking further measures to develop the institutional and administrative capacity of all Roman@@ ian law en@@ for@@ cement authorities and of the judic@@ i@@ ary .
we believe that this should be possible if the necessary political effort , as well as the required financial and human resources , are de@@ plo@@ yed to this end .
if , however , any serious short@@ com@@ ings are obser@@ ved in the ful@@ fil@@ ment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments lis@@ ted in the EU position , this can form the basis for invo@@ king the safeguard clause post@@ pon@@ ing Romania &apos;s accession by one year .
here again , the Council can decide by qualified majority .
the European Union will continue to monitor closely Romania &apos;s prepar@@ ations and achiev@@ ements , including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the and in particular the areas of justice and home affairs , competition and the environment .
to this end , the Commission will continue to sub@@ mit annual reports on Romania &apos;s progress towards accession , together with recommendations if appropriate .
I welcome the statement in the report by Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i that the European Parliament will monitor the developments in Romania as well and encourage the new Roman@@ ian Government to fulfil all the commitments made during the negotiations .
it is quite clear that the report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2004 has fulfi@@ lled its purpose as a wa@@ ke @-@ up call to the Roman@@ ian Government .
that is how the Roman@@ ian Government has perc@@ eiv@@ ed it ; and it has convinced it to inten@@ si@@ fy the accession strategy and policies .
I was delighted to learn that Parliament , in its latest report about Romania , could sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to the recommendations of the reg@@ ular report of the Commission .
since then - and I par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ ase the wor@@ ding of the Commission - we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgar@@ ia and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004 , on the basis of its own mer@@ its , with a view to sig@@ ning the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty as early as possible in 2005 , and we all expect Bulgar@@ ia and Romania to fulfil the economic and criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007 .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to thank Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i for tab@@ ling a report that is both balanced and in @-@ de@@ p@@ th .
the Commission has always warm@@ ly welcomed the European Parliament &apos;s constructive eng@@ ag@@ ement in the process of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union .
I should also like to thank the Council for its productive cooperation .
Mr President , your report of March 2004 was a real &apos; wa@@ ke @-@ up call &apos; for Romania .
being tou@@ gh and very deman@@ ding , it finally help@@ ed to bring about further progress in the accession negotiations .
it led , with the Commission &apos;s im@@ pe@@ tus , to a series of reforms , which were lis@@ ted in Romania &apos;s fam@@ ous &apos; T@@ o D@@ o Lis@@ t &apos; , under which the Roman@@ ian authorities put greater emphasis on improving political and economic governance .
as Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï said , the Union will now fin@@ alise the accession negotiations with Romania on F@@ rid@@ ay .
however , I under@@ line that conclu@@ ding the negotiations does not mean the end of the work .
on the contrary , the two @-@ year period to 2007 must be used by Romania to become a full @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged Member State : pl@@ enty of hard work , commitment and especially deli@@ very is needed .
we will carry out an enhan@@ ced monitoring of compliance with the commitments ente@@ red into and of ongoing prepar@@ ations in general .
for Romania and Bulgar@@ ia , we have agreed a new safeguard clause cover@@ ing the period between clos@@ ure of the negotiations and actual accession .
this clause provides for the post@@ pon@@ ement of accession by one year if there is clear evidence that Romania will be man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tly un@@ prepared to meet the requirements of membership .
the Member States could then acti@@ va@@ te the sus@@ pension clause by unanim@@ ity , on the basis of the Commission &apos;s recommendation .
let me also point out that in the c@@ hap@@ ter concerning competition and state aid@@ s , the Commission was not able to propose a prov@@ isi@@ onal clos@@ ure of negotiations .
however , the Council , due to earlier political commitments , ch@@ ose to close the negotiations by the end of 2004 .
moreover , in regard to justice and home affairs , the Council asked for more reas@@ suring en@@ for@@ cement mechanisms .
therefore , in close cooperation with the Netherlands presidency , the Commission worked out a proposal for a reinfor@@ ced monitoring mechanism linked to safeguard c@@ laus@@ es in these two areas : justice and home affairs , and competition and state aid@@ s .
in these areas , the sus@@ pension clause can be acti@@ va@@ ted by a qualified majority of the Member States , which gives it str@@ onger credibility than if it were only acti@@ va@@ ted by unanim@@ ity .
I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause .
should the monitoring by the Commission show that Romania is not properly prepared for membership , we should not hes@@ ita@@ te to recommen@@ d that the Council invo@@ ke this sus@@ pension clause .
to be absolutely clear : the aim of this clause is not to pen@@ alise Romania , but to protect Romania and the EU Member States from any negative effects that Romania &apos;s possible man@@ i@@ f@@ est un@@ prepar@@ ed@@ ness for membership might enta@@ il .
before clos@@ ing , let me briefly tou@@ ch upon the political situation in Romania .
I know that Parliament is concerned about alle@@ ged ir@@ reg@@ ul@@ ar@@ ities in the parliamentary and presid@@ ential elections that recently took place in Romania .
I am also aware of the assess@@ ments made by several Roman@@ ian NGOs .
however , I would like to rec@@ all that the O@@ S@@ C@@ E election assessment te@@ am stated that overall the administration of the Roman@@ ian elections &apos; seem@@ ed professional and effici@@ ently organised &apos; .
I also note that the O@@ S@@ C@@ E has assess@@ ed the overall conduct of the election as satisfactory in the second round .
moreover , both presid@@ ential candid@@ ates accepted the final results of the presid@@ ential elections .
I trust - and this is important for the European Union as well as for Romania - that the new presid@@ ent @-@ elec@@ t and the forthcoming government in for@@ mation will be determined to continue with the reforms that are needed for Romania to acc@@ ed@@ e to the European Union .
that is very much in the interest of Romania and Roman@@ ians .
let me conclude by saying that I endorse the conclusions of the report by your rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , which are , in general , in line with the 2004 Re@@ gu@@ la@@ r Re@@ port .
the Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of Romania &apos;s progress towards accession .
.
Mr President , the Committee on Budgets would like to point out that the financial pre @-@ accession aid granted to Romania in 2004 has amoun@@ ted to EUR 8@@ 25 million , which comes from the national P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E programme and the SA@@ P@@ A@@ R@@ D and I@@ S@@ P@@ A instruments .
I would also like to point out that the total v@@ olu@@ me of this aid is appro@@ xim@@ ately e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to 1.@@ 4 % of the country &apos;s G@@ DP .
as in the case of Bulgar@@ ia , the Committee on Budgets is pleased about the establishment in s@@ pring 2004 of the new funding framework for the accession of Romania .
it is also pleased that , as for Bulgar@@ ia , the Commission has proposed restric@@ ting this package of aid to a period of three years in order that it may be adap@@ ted to the future political needs ste@@ m@@ ming from the new financial perspec@@ tives that are going to be approved .
all of the financial aid will depen@@ d on these new financial perspec@@ tives , but from 200@@ 9 .
un@@ like what happened in the case of the report on Bulgar@@ ia , in this case the Committee on Budgets wishes to stress the need to make sustain@@ ed efforts to enhan@@ ce Romania &apos;s administrative capacity with regard to the essential fields of custom@@ s , V@@ A@@ T and statistics on gro@@ s@@ s domestic product .
this means having appropriate capacity to collec@@ t and control V@@ A@@ T and custom@@ s du@@ ties , and to cal@@ cula@@ te gro@@ s@@ s domestic product credi@@ bly , precisely and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ti@@ vely , in accordance with the S@@ EC 95 rules .
.
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , on the excellent work he has done on this report on Romania .
I would also like to thank him for his open attitude and his spirit of compromise .
Mr President , in the last two years , Romania has made very significant progress on its jour@@ ne@@ y towards integration with the European Union .
I naturally welcome this progress .
a decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday .
the clos@@ ure of these negotiations is expected to be confirmed at the European Council this week , but it is clear that the work is not over .
in fact , Romania has important work to do before the accession sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for 2007 can take place .
I am not only talking about the procedures necessary for full ratification of the Treaty ; it must also inten@@ si@@ fy its efforts in a series of essential areas .
to this end , it must carry out the reforms in the field of public administration , it must improve judicial administration and ensure that it is independent - a field in which it adopted an important legislative package a few months ago ; it must enhan@@ ce the fight against cor@@ ruption , a serious problem which continues to affect the country .
and efforts are also needed in the field of preser@@ ving the environment .
in short , the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow speci@@ f@@ ies in detail many areas in which the Roman@@ ian authorities must continue to make efforts .
Mr President , my position and the report essentially consis@@ ts of the following : on the one hand , an open and positive view of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union within the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale .
on the other hand , a deman@@ ding position in relation to the efforts Romania must make , which will require determination and per@@ sever@@ ance .
I believe that this is the clear tw@@ in message that the Roman@@ ian authorities now in office following the elections of recent days must receive .
through this report , the European Parliament is saying yes to the integration of Romania , but it will be monitoring that country &apos;s compliance with all of its commitments .
this Parliament must follow the efforts the Roman@@ ian authorities must make very closely .
we are also coun@@ ting on the information that the Commission must send out reg@@ ularly to us in this regard , as the Commissioner has pointed out .
finally , on this jour@@ ne@@ y Romania still has to make towards accession , it can coun@@ t on our vi@@ g@@ il@@ ance , but , of course , it can also coun@@ t on our assistance and our im@@ pe@@ tus .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and well balanced report .
the report men@@ tions both the positive and the negative aspects , the strong points and the wea@@ k points , which Romania will have to address .
on the positive side , the report clearly states that Romania meet@@ s the Copenhagen political criteria , that it has strength@@ ened the stability of its institutions that guarantee State democracy and human rights , and that the situation has improved in the field of protection of human and eth@@ nic rights , with regard to both the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian minority and the Rom@@ a minority .
on the positive side , Romania also ful@@ f@@ ils the criteri@@ on of a functioning market economy and , moreover , has implemented and is continuing to implement a programme of structural reforms .
if we look at the economic results , the economic statistics for Romania , we can see that the country has one of the strong@@ est growth rates in the whole of E@@ as@@ tern Europe .
naturally , Romania still has to make considerable efforts and make significant progress , however , before it can be accepted into the European Union .
both Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï and Mr R@@ eh@@ n have referred to certain aspects in detail .
I should like to mention a few of them : the areas of justice and internal affairs , like every@@ where in E@@ as@@ tern Europe , the fight against cor@@ ruption and against organised crime , and also border controls .
problems also remain in the fields of economic competition , of state support and , of course , of protecting the natural environment .
in s@@ pite of everything , however , I believe that Romania is well on the way .
it is up to Romania and Romania alone as to whether it will manage to elimin@@ ate all the wea@@ k points in the coming months .
if it does succeed , I am of the opinion that the treaty should be signed in 2005 so that Romania , along with Bulgar@@ ia , can be accepted into the European Union in 2007 .
. Mr President , it has been a ple@@ asure to work with Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i on this fine report .
indeed I enjo@@ yed and valu@@ ed his work in his earlier capacity as a minis@@ ter . it is just as much of a ple@@ asure to work with him as a rapporteur .
I thank Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i for this fine work .
I believe that President I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u - as he re@@ ti@@ res from his second and final term of office - and his government , as well as Prime Minister N@@ as@@ ta@@ se , have concluded their work on a high note .
they should be pro@@ ud of their successful achiev@@ ement of the enlargement process for Romania .
it is easy today to d@@ am@@ n Romania with fa@@ int p@@ raise , to say that she has done well but has a huge amount more to do .
that may indeed be true , but let us rec@@ all the low position from which she has come and has advan@@ ced so ra@@ pid@@ ly .
n@@ one of us would have dre@@ am@@ ed five years ago , when the Hel@@ sin@@ ki Council declar@@ ed Romania to be one of the &apos; reg@@ at@@ ta principle &apos; countries , that she could have comple@@ ted the c@@ hap@@ ters so ra@@ pid@@ ly and indeed so well .
all the c@@ hap@@ ters are closed .
of course , implementation must be high on the agenda of the new government and it will have to have very competent people to implement this matter .
they have to apply the properly and respect the dead@@ lines .
a great deal of capacity @-@ building has to happen .
administrative capacity is vital in applying the as well as ongoing training of staff .
however , let us remember what an enormous amount has been achieved .
one of the ways in which we could help is by trying to stop the bra@@ in dra@@ in .
Romania needs its young people very b@@ ad@@ ly .
we should do all we can to strengthen the position of higher education in Romania , to help the country offer jobs , training and wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s to young people .
it would be very easy , as Romania comes ever closer to the Union , for us to be a ma@@ gn@@ et for her young people to leave the country .
that would be a very great p@@ ity .
it is those young people who will assis@@ t Romania in implementing the correc@@ tly and improving the ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in .
I congratulate the Commission too for the very de@@ dic@@ ated work which colleagues and I have seen carried out over the last few years .
I have put forward one amendment , at which I would ask Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i and other colleagues to look carefully .
they have acknowled@@ ged that I have been concentra@@ ting in particular on the issue of children .
while I understood and respected Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i &apos;s support for Prime Minister R@@ aff@@ ar@@ in &apos;s request for an international com@@ mission to re @-@ examine certain sensitive cases on humanitarian grounds where there have been problems with in@@ ter @-@ country adoption , nonetheless , I wonder if colleagues might consider accep@@ ting my amendment to paragraph 17 .
Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i &apos;s report requests an international com@@ mission .
that is one outside the European Union .
my own amendment as@@ ks the Commission to take up this matter with the Roman@@ ian Government - which is right and proper - and also to report back to the government of Romania and - since I know that colleagues are concerned about this - to the European Parliament as well .
perhaps Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i and I could discuss this .
I am sure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let it be clear that this is not a debate between those in favour of Romania &apos;s accession to the European Union and those who op@@ pose it .
my group does not have any fundamental objec@@ tions to Romania &apos;s membership either , not even on 1 January 2007 .
this is a debate , however , between those who think that , excep@@ t for a few lo@@ ose ends , Romania is ready , and those , myself included , who think that it is not , and see that as a reason why we cannot give the go @-@ ahead right now .
I am , in all hon@@ es@@ ty , surpris@@ ed at the position of some groups .
the very same Members of this House who rightly atta@@ ched great importance to human rights during the vote and discussions about Turkey , a country that is on the very th@@ res@@ hold of negotiations , are , in the case of Romania , a country that is compl@@ et@@ ing them , prepared to over@@ look just about anything where the same Copenhagen criteria are concerned .
there are yet other Members in this House whose view of reality has , quite hon@@ es@@ tly , been somewhat cl@@ ou@@ ded by the fact that members of their parties are probably involved in re@@ prehen@@ sible affairs , or because they hope that , after the recent elections in Romania , everything will be very different over@@ night .
hope for improvement is fine , but we should not be na@@ i@@ ve .
the problems in Romania are im@@ men@@ se , so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that we cannot give them the gre@@ en light .
I will give you two examples .
over the past few years , there has been no improvement in the situation of journ@@ alists and the media in Romania ; indeed , it has changed for the worse .
the number of attacks on critical journ@@ alists has increased and the criticism le@@ ve@@ lled at them was often connec@@ ted to cases of cor@@ ruption .
all NGOs , all the organisations that we always p@@ raise so highly - Trans@@ par@@ ency International , the O@@ p@@ en Soci@@ ety In@@ stitu@@ te , the O@@ EC@@ D - all have one message : cor@@ ruption is still ri@@ f@@ e in Romania and should not be under@@ estima@@ ted .
of course , everyone here will state that cor@@ ruption is to be comb@@ ated , but how seriously can we take a party which has a majority in the Roman@@ ian parliament and a member of which - also a former minis@@ ter - had to step down a few years ago on account of cor@@ ruption , and is now vice @-@ chairman of that same party and a candidate for the sen@@ ate ?
in my view , this , together with Am@@ nes@@ ty International &apos;s reports about the truly ab@@ omin@@ able treatment of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c pati@@ ents , can only lead to one conclusion , namely that Romania should wait for a little longer .
that is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separate report next s@@ pring , for example , on the aspects which everyone , including the rapporteur , wor@@ ry about , namely freedom of the press , cor@@ ruption , independence of the judic@@ i@@ ary ?
the Commission does comp@@ ile a report on possible problems concerning competition , but ref@@ uses to de@@ vote a f@@ res@@ h report to human rights problems .
why should state support be a stu@@ mb@@ ling blo@@ ck and human rights not ?
to those who say - and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the presidency - that we still have the sus@@ pension clause at our dispos@@ al , which enab@@ les us to delay Romania &apos;s accession by one year , I should like to state clearly that this sus@@ pension clause can only be invo@@ ked if there is a unanim@@ ous vote in favour of it .
in other words , if one country in the Council ref@@ uses to cooperate , then it will not happen .
what about qualified majority ?
regretta@@ bly , that can only be applied to a number of specific areas , and freedom of the press is not one of them .
in my view , Parliament should not re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish its power by giving the go @-@ ahead now and , log@@ ically , doing the same thing in March .
Parliament must take itself seriously .
I would like to quo@@ te from a major Dutch new@@ s@@ paper : &apos; with fri@@ end@@ lin@@ ess that la@@ cks hon@@ es@@ ty , Europe may become big , but it is growth without substance , gre@@ at@@ ness without inn@@ er streng@@ th . &quot;
the streng@@ th of the European Union is to be found in principles that apply univers@@ ally , including to political all@@ ies .
. Mr President , Romania has a long tradition of author@@ ita@@ rian and un@@ democratic government , L@@ ef@@ t @-@ wing and Ri@@ ght @-@ wing alterna@@ tely .
this tradition goes hand in hand with an in@@ toler@@ ant attitude towards its eth@@ nic minorities - H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians , Rom@@ a and Ger@@ man@@ s .
a great deal of attention is always paid to major dam projects , enormous fac@@ tor@@ ies and mon@@ u@@ mental buil@@ dings , but not to va@@ grant children men@@ ac@@ ed by g@@ lu@@ e s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing or pro@@ stitu@@ tion , or to serious environmental pollution .
in Ro@@ sia Mon@@ tan@@ a , there is still the risk of a g@@ old ex@@ trac@@ tion project going ahead , which will use chem@@ ical substances capable of seriously pollu@@ ting the so@@ il and ri@@ ver water in the long term .
in the c@@ ities , the mon@@ u@@ mental fac@@ ad@@ es h@@ ide dec@@ ay , ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t and poverty .
freedom of the press and independence of the judic@@ i@@ ary do not meet European standards .
in neighbour@@ ing M@@ ol@@ da@@ via , which came under Russian rule in 19@@ 40 , there was initial support for re@@ uni@@ fication , but , as Romania has little to offer at the moment , that support has now eb@@ bed away .
at present , many Roman@@ ians look up to America and the doll@@ ar above all , and , to a less@@ er extent , to Turkey , which is regar@@ ded as a major economic part@@ ner and an example of a self @-@ assu@@ red country .
at international level , Romania is currently , like Turkey , a close ally of the United States , so much so that it is hin@@ der@@ ing cooperation with the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al Court in The H@@ ag@@ ue .
compla@@ ints about election fraud were lo@@ d@@ ged again recently .
I do not expect the car@@ eless interpre@@ tation of parliamentary democracy to dis@@ appear following last wee@@ ken@@ d &apos;s election of a presid@@ ent from the other side of the political spec@@ tru@@ m , who is also likely to determin@@ e the com@@ position of a new government .
this new government will probably take the view that the previous government was too me@@ ek in its negotiations with the European Union and that it had allowed itself to be hu@@ mili@@ ated .
in its previous com@@ position , this parliament was extremely critical about the possibility of Romania fulfi@@ lling in the short term the current EU criteria in terms of democracy , human rights and the environment .
that is why it seem@@ ed certain that Romania would be join@@ ing later than Bulgar@@ ia , together with C@@ roati@@ a at the very earli@@ est .
I am surpris@@ ed at the recent U @-@ turn within the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rejec@@ tion of a number of critical amendments .
the fear that Romania might be hu@@ mili@@ ated and the EU &apos;s amb@@ ition for spe@@ edy territor@@ ial ex@@ pan@@ sion now appear more im@@ per@@ ative than sol@@ ving problems .
the Con@@ feder@@ al Group of the European United L@@ ef@@ t / Nor@@ di@@ c Green L@@ ef@@ t would like to welcome Romania to the European Union as quickly as possible , provided that , as is the case with Turkey , solutions have been found to the problems in the areas of democracy , human rights and the environment , and this is still a huge obsta@@ cle at the moment .
. Mr President , as a former ship &apos;s cap@@ tain , the new@@ ly @-@ elected President of Romania , Tra@@ ian Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u , knows a thing or two about ch@@ opp@@ y waters , which gives him a considerable ed@@ ge , for the ship of state of his na@@ tive country , where he will be taking the hel@@ m , is currently facing rou@@ gh se@@ as .
moreover , Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u will be the first to ad@@ mit this fran@@ kly . in an inter@@ view with the of 26 November , Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u , who is at present the ma@@ y@@ or of Bu@@ char@@ est , gave this explanation of why he is s@@ tri@@ ving to turn his country round politically : &apos; the problem is cor@@ ruption which , in this country , has been el@@ e@@ va@@ ted to a form of government . &quot;
the report by Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i is just as clear about Bu@@ char@@ est &apos;s fail@@ ings as it makes its way to Brussels , and we sinc@@ er@@ ely appreciate the way in which he has done this , quite rightly trac@@ ing Romania &apos;s short@@ com@@ ings in terms of all the accession criteria , including the political conditions .
in the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country , I asked for attention to be paid to viol@@ ations of the freedom of the press .
unfortunately , this report men@@ tions these viol@@ ations again in Par@@ agrap@@ h 8 .
it is as pla@@ in as day that there is p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion against investi@@ ga@@ tive journ@@ alists , and that the government exer@@ ts pressure on finan@@ ci@@ ally wea@@ k media .
in his recent bo@@ o@@ k &apos; Th@@ re@@ a@@ tened journ@@ alists , be@@ a@@ ten journ@@ alists , &quot; the auth@@ or and journ@@ alist Mal@@ in B@@ ot confirmed this de@@ pres@@ sing im@@ age .
the bo@@ o@@ k is an ou@@ tri@@ ght indic@@ tment of the pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing press res@@ tra@@ int in Romania .
Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u and his political sy@@ mpa@@ th@@ is@@ ers therefore have their work cut out .
inc@@ id@@ enta@@ lly , in our regions , in W@@ estern Europe , we should take note of what Mal@@ in B@@ ot has to say about the du@@ b@@ ious role of W@@ estern publis@@ h@@ ers who have b@@ ought up many Roman@@ ian paper@@ s , and who , in his words , &apos; do not come to Romania to defend democracy , but simply to make money . &quot;
I hope that a new Roman@@ ian Government takes the European accession criteria entirely seriously from the word go .
in the final analysis , it is not fair to bla@@ me them for the commitments that have not been compli@@ ed with by the N@@ as@@ ta@@ se government .
this list is long and w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ty .
moreover , time goes on ; it is for@@ tun@@ ate , with the des@@ i@@ red accession date of 1 January 2007 in mind , that the in@@ coming President Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u realis@@ es this all too well .
that is why he deser@@ ves all our attention and support in this un@@ doub@@ tedly difficult period .
this House ex@@ pects the Commission to stric@@ tly en@@ force the security mechanism agreed upon with Bu@@ char@@ est .
to fin@@ ish off , I should like to draw Bu@@ char@@ est &apos;s attention to one paragraph in the M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i report : &apos; calls on it to speed up the res@@ t@@ itu@@ tion of proper@@ ty and adopt legislation on the res@@ t@@ itu@@ tion of ch@@ ur@@ ches . &quot;
at the same time , I would ask the Council and Commission to closely monitor the implementation of this long drawn @-@ out issue .
the Dutch Presidency has already made a ple@@ d@@ ge to that effect to its own parliament .
in a fine review in a German quality new@@ s@@ paper yesterday , I read a ra@@ z@@ or @-@ shar@@ p sa@@ ti@@ re on the political de@@ generation of Romania under post @-@ Commun@@ ist rule .
the auth@@ or ap@@ tly par@@ o@@ di@@ ed the t@@ it@@ le of Prime Minister N@@ as@@ ta@@ se &apos;s campaign document entitled : &apos; from Kar@@ l Mar@@ x to C@@ oc@@ a @-@ Col@@ a , &quot; claim@@ ing that a document entitled &apos; F@@ ro@@ m Kar@@ l Mar@@ x to A@@ l C@@ ap@@ one &quot; would be just as tru@@ th@@ ful .
we very much hope that Romania , under President Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u , will break this per@@ sis@@ tent political s@@ pel@@ l .
the surpris@@ ing outcome of the second round of the presid@@ ential elections appears to be an encouraging sign of this .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the New Italian Soci@@ alist Party wishes the in@@ coming President Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u all the best in his work .
the coun@@ t@@ less young Roman@@ ians who have supported him over recent months and are ju@@ bil@@ antly fi@@ lling the s@@ quar@@ es and stre@@ ets of Bu@@ char@@ est and the rest of the country are , regar@@ d@@ less of their political aff@@ ili@@ ations , p@@ inning on him their hop@@ es for change and for a different , new and better future .
Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u has a difficult and yet rather exc@@ iting task ahead of him : to ste@@ er his country on the new cour@@ ses of modern@@ isation , anti @-@ cor@@ ruption measures and full compliance with human and civil rights , as well as the permanent adoption of democratic structures .
we hope - or rather , we are sure - that the end of that jour@@ ne@@ y can only be the total integration of Romania into the political and soci@@ o@@ economic blo@@ c of the European Union .
while we note with satisfac@@ tion the goals that have been achieved , our task over the remain@@ ing two years will be to ensure that concrete , real and significant improvements are made in the many areas that still fall short of European standards .
I refer in particular to the qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive lea@@ p that is urg@@ ently needed in the field of human rights , especially with regard to the requests of the Rom@@ a minority , which often su@@ ff@@ ers discrimination with the ac@@ qui@@ es@@ c@@ ence of government authorities .
the Rom@@ a make up 2@@ .@@ 5 million citizens who live on the ed@@ ges of society in totally unacceptable conditions .
I also refer to the requests and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions of the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian minority , which consis@@ ts of 1.@@ 5 million people ; the treatment of the disab@@ led ; the sha@@ me@@ ful condition of the health infrastructure , especially those facil@@ ities h@@ ous@@ ing pati@@ ents with mental problems ; the viol@@ ent methods and actual p@@ hy@@ si@@ cal abuse prac@@ tis@@ ed by the forces of law and order ; a judicial system that fail@@ s to meet the criteria of efficiency and independence ; as well as media that are still not entirely free .
on vis@@ iting the country , I was struc@@ k and d@@ istu@@ r@@ bed by the many - too many - children wan@@ der@@ ing the stre@@ ets alone .
we must demand a concrete commitment from the government on this issue .
it is a legal and mor@@ al obligation , not an option .
everything possible has to be done , then , to ensure that every child in Romania , as in Europe and the rest of the world , has the right to a peaceful , happy chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od and the right to s@@ mil@@ e with hope for the future .
Mr President , I have been a Romania @-@ w@@ at@@ ch@@ er for five years now , ever since I took up the case of a L@@ on@@ d@@ on constitu@@ ent of min@@ e , P@@ rin@@ ce Car@@ ol M@@ ir@@ ce@@ a .
he demonstrated clearly to me that the Roman@@ ian Government , through its Pro@@ secu@@ tor General , had repe@@ a@@ tedly interven@@ ed on one side - alle@@ g@@ ed@@ ly under ins@@ truc@@ tions from President I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u - of the civil case against Car@@ ol &apos;s half bro@@ ther , e@@ x @-@ K@@ ing M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el of Romania .
I was therefore particularly delighted at seeing the independence of the Roman@@ ian justice system .
not only has Romania now ab@@ olis@@ hed the So@@ vi@@ et @-@ er@@ a right for the state to interven@@ e in civil cases , but recently , when the previous government tried to circum@@ v@@ ent the ro@@ y@@ al pal@@ ace &apos;s proper@@ ty claim dispu@@ te by a b@@ ill of compensation in the Parliament , the S@@ en@@ ate thre@@ w it out , c@@ iting the fact that it was before the Su@@ pre@@ me Court .
so , things are improving in terms of the independence of Romania &apos;s justice system .
clearly , Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s vic@@ tory in the presid@@ ential elections shows that Romania is also moving ra@@ pid@@ ly forward in reform terms .
the surpris@@ e result defin@@ i@@ tely s@@ cot@@ ched all the alle@@ gations that the election would be st@@ olen by che@@ ating by the authorities .
Romania is far from perfec@@ t and the fight against cor@@ ruption and organised crime will be priority number one for the new government .
more work needs to be done on minority rights , including the large Rom@@ a population and the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian population .
also let me make a ple@@ a against a ri@@ gi@@ d im@@ position of the mor@@ ator@@ ium against foreign child adop@@ tions , as many families from countries as di@@ ver@@ se as Italy and Israel have developed b@@ on@@ ds with children in or@@ p@@ han@@ ages .
it would be cru@@ el and in@@ human@@ e to termin@@ ate the process ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ arily at this late stage .
I welcome the Roman@@ ian Government &apos;s decision to establish an international committee to resolve this del@@ icate issue .
as V@@ ice @-@ President of the Ukraine Del@@ e@@ gation , I believe that out@@ standing dispu@@ tes such as the issue of territor@@ ial claim@@ s by Romania over tin@@ y S@@ na@@ ke Is@@ land in the B@@ lack Se@@ a , which is currently under Ukrain@@ ian control , need to be resolved before 2007 .
here , the ow@@ nership of the exclu@@ sive economic interest zone is essential , as oil is believ@@ ed to be present .
good relations with Ukraine , which is now establishing itself as a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged European democracy , are important for the future .
another issue is the border area of the Dan@@ u@@ be D@@ el@@ ta , where there are concerns that a Ukrain@@ ian @-@ buil@@ t na@@ vi@@ g@@ able chan@@ nel is up@@ setting the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding w@@ et@@ lands and hence also the uni@@ que local ha@@ b@@ ita@@ t for r@@ are b@@ ir@@ d species .
more dis@@ tant is the whole issue of co@@ operating with and sta@@ bil@@ ising M@@ ol@@ do@@ va and the Trans@@ n@@ is@@ tri@@ a question that goes with it .
inte@@ res@@ t@@ ingly , if Mr Y@@ us@@ ch@@ en@@ ko comes to power in K@@ i@@ e@@ v on 26 December , the days for the T@@ ir@@ as@@ po@@ l regime of Trans@@ n@@ is@@ tri@@ a are nu@@ mb@@ ered , hence the Rus@@ si@@ ans &apos; desire to den@@ y Mr Y@@ us@@ ch@@ en@@ ko vic@@ tory .
has any@@ body investi@@ g@@ ated whether the T@@ ir@@ as@@ po@@ l regime may also have had a role to play in the pois@@ on@@ ing of Mr Y@@ us@@ ch@@ en@@ ko ?
I believe Romania will be ready to join the European Union by 1 January 2007 with Bulgar@@ ia .
I welcome both as EU Member States , although I do not see the two as ch@@ ron@@ olog@@ ically cou@@ pl@@ ed autom@@ ati@@ cally .
lastly , of course , there are the safeguard c@@ laus@@ es which allow date sli@@ p@@ pa@@ ge if Romania fall@@ s short of its requirements under the ; but nevertheless I fully support the M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i report and look forward to Romania join@@ ing us in the 25 Member States by 2007 .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i on his very objective and well @-@ balanced report .
I fully agree with Mr R@@ eh@@ n and Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , who I feel have expressed very objective opinions .
Romania &apos;s accession is bene@@ fic@@ ial to H@@ un@@ g@@ ary for two reasons ; on the one hand , good neighbour@@ lin@@ ess , and on the other , the issue of the minority H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian community , with more than half a million H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians living in Romania .
that is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Romania to acc@@ ed@@ e in two years &quot; time .
ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the N@@ as@@ ta@@ se Government , which has done a great deal to bring about the historic re@@ conciliation between Romania and H@@ un@@ g@@ ary .
today we have a strategic partnership .
it is true that in all hon@@ es@@ ty much remains to be done , but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years .
I should like to stress three key issues that need to be resolved .
the first is genuine dec@@ entr@@ alisation , and a real de@@ vol@@ vement of power to the regions .
the next is the protection of the environment , as cle@@ an ri@@ vers are a cross @-@ border issue .
finally , there is the question of the minorities , the Rom@@ a and the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians .
I do not wish to make the implementation of different forms of autonom@@ y a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite to Romania &apos;s accession , but it would be help@@ ful to open negotiations with the new government , namely tri@@ part@@ ite negotiations between the Roman@@ ian Government , the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian parliamentary party and the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian Government , as was done in the case of South T@@ y@@ ro@@ l and the Å@@ land Is@@ lands in Fin@@ land .
the European Union off@@ ers help@@ ful preced@@ ents here .
it would therefore be des@@ ira@@ ble to start the negotiations , and I fully support Romania &apos;s accession without delay .
it is perhaps Romania that has the wor@@ st leg@@ acy of all the former commun@@ ist countries .
C@@ e@@ auc@@ es@@ c@@ u and his associ@@ ates destro@@ yed the country , ru@@ ined its economy , fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted its society and inti@@ mid@@ ated its citizens .
the last fif@@ teen years are far from being a success s@@ tory as the post@@ pon@@ ement of reforms w@@ as@@ ted several valuable years .
I therefore hope that the new@@ ly @-@ elected leaders , President and Government of Romania will set about facing the challenges before them with re@@ doub@@ led effort .
there are two tasks that I especially would like to mention .
the first one , where there are considerable defic@@ i@@ encies , is the social integration of the Roman@@ ian Rom@@ any minority comp@@ ris@@ ing of over two million people , who are in a very difficult situation .
the second one is giving a higher priority to environmental issues , since the state of the environment in Romania is far behind that of the other candidate countries .
regulations not only have to be adopted , but they have to be implemented as well .
let me remind you of the very dangerous min@@ ing project of Ro@@ sia Mon@@ tan@@ a , threa@@ tening us with sever@@ e environmental disaster .
the road that lead@@ s to the comple@@ tion of negotiations is long and ru@@ g@@ ged , and I congratulate Romania &apos;s lead@@ ership on their success .
from now on it should focus on adopting the .
I hope Romania will fulfil the obligations and will become a member state in 2007 .
this is in our interest and in Romania &apos;s interest .
I therefore think that Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s demand that two c@@ hap@@ ters should be re@@ open@@ ed for negotiations is highly ris@@ ky .
it je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ es Romania &apos;s accession in 2007 , and delay is not in the interest of either Romania , or the European Union .
Romania has made great sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ es in order to be able to work towards becoming a member of the Union .
I firmly believe that it is in our best interest that Romania join@@ s as soon as 2007 , and Romania must realise that several obligations simply must be fulfi@@ lled on the way .
this is why I find this to@@ pic so crucial and ask the Commissioner and the Commission to continu@@ ously monitor Romania &apos;s progress in this matter , as it is not only in our best interest but also in the interest of Roman@@ ian citizens .
Mr President , in the environmental sp@@ here , Romania at present la@@ gs very far behind in terms of what is required by EU legislation .
in s@@ pite of the fact that it has been given very long trans@@ itional perio@@ ds where important environmental regulations are concerned , it has not implemented different legislation .
where , in a number of areas , such legislation has in actual fact been en@@ ac@@ ted , it has been so on paper but not in practice .
last year , we sent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety to the D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of the Environment in Bu@@ char@@ est .
the delegation examin@@ ed quite a few of the more contro@@ versi@@ al projects , and our view was confirmed : the p@@ ace of reform in the environmental sp@@ here needs urg@@ ently to be ste@@ pped up .
there is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular e@@ ye on over the next few years .
it concerns Ro@@ sia Mon@@ tan@@ a , a proposal to construc@@ t Europe &apos;s larg@@ est g@@ old min@@ e in Romania .
it is a project that will have huge environmental re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions .
among other things , large qu@@ ant@@ ities of cy@@ an@@ ide will be used in this sensitive area .
the issue is that of whether Romania will comply with current EU legislation , for example the provisions govern@@ ing environmental impact assess@@ ments and the water directive .
the issue is also that of whether Romania will success@@ fully comply with the forthcoming new directive on waste from min@@ es and its environmental re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions .
I should like to call upon the Commission to examine the Ro@@ sia Mon@@ tan@@ a project particularly carefully to see if there really is successful compliance with the EU &apos;s environmental requirements , which I consider to be minimum standards and ones with which compliance is also being deman@@ ded by the local population in the area .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I join in with the many positive comments made to the rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , regarding the balance of his report .
while not ignor@@ ing any of the critical areas in the process of Romania &apos;s prepar@@ ation to join the European Union , the report shows a clear appreci@@ ation of the no@@ table efforts made and the results - al@@ be@@ it still parti@@ al - achieved by Romania in that process .
this morning , with great ap@@ l@@ om@@ b , this Parliament gave the gre@@ en light to the procedure for Turkey &apos;s prepar@@ ation to join the European Union .
I am in favour of Romania &apos;s accession for exactly the same reasons that have led me to express my strong h@@ os@@ til@@ ity to Turkey &apos;s entry .
Romania is Europe ; Romania has a civil and political society based on values which , despite their un@@ den@@ i@@ able hi@@ gh@@ s and lo@@ ws , have to be regar@@ ded as perfectly compar@@ able to the values on which the European Union is based .
certain areas in which basic measures are still needed certainly deser@@ ve encoura@@ g@@ ement and support .
they include the multi@@ annual anti @-@ crime strategy , the state aid issue ( a subject particularly close to the hear@@ ts of us liber@@ alists ) , the sensitive question of the return of proper@@ ty and ch@@ ur@@ ches , as well as the modern@@ isation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a society such as Europe &apos;s , which is character@@ ised by systems that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state .
I have just lis@@ tened to the speech by a spo@@ kes@@ man for a political party that voted for the accession of Turkey , who repe@@ ated the har@@ s@@ h remarks made by NGOs about respect for human rights in Romania .
I should like to have heard the same obser@@ vations made about Turkey as well : in that case they would have been decid@@ ed@@ ly more justified .
it is , however , absolutely necessary to call the Roman@@ ian authorities &quot; attention to the urgent question of illegal immigration .
one Member has referred to the children , who under@@ stand@@ ably had an em@@ o@@ tional effect on him during a visit to Romania .
I do not need to go to Romania , because you just need to dri@@ ve around the stre@@ ets of Tur@@ in , M@@ il@@ an , Gen@@ oa and R@@ ome to see Roman@@ ian children explo@@ ited by criminal organisations .
we have to put a stop to illegal immigration , and Romania has to defend its external borders and actively coll@@ abor@@ ate in sta@@ mp@@ ing out this activity , which does no credit to the civil@@ isation of E@@ u@@ gen I@@ on@@ es@@ c@@ u , M@@ ir@@ ce@@ a E@@ li@@ ade and the many other great w@@ ri@@ ters and thin@@ kers of a civil@@ isation that we feel is close to us and which we share .
Romania &apos;s citizens have a place in the European Union , there is no question about it .
one of the reasons why we mu@@ tually need each other is because through accession , the under@@ lying principles of the Union , dec@@ entr@@ alisation and local self @-@ government may help improve pros@@ pects for the future of the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian minority there , including one and a half million people .
the question is about fulfi@@ lling commitments : will Romania be able to adopt the that all Member States are obliged to fulfil ?
the Union seems to be more len@@ i@@ ent towards Romania than it was towards those countries that join@@ ed in May .
Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i &apos;s report critic@@ ally examin@@ es how Romania has met the criteria so far .
I would like to compl@@ im@@ ent him on his s@@ k@@ ill at compromise , as he included several of my proposed amendments into his report , making his arguments fir@@ mer .
the report examin@@ es areas of sever@@ e defic@@ it : the independence of judicial proceedings , the discrimin@@ atory legislation on election rights and the return of ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical goods .
let me take this even a step further and point out some of Romania &apos;s defic@@ i@@ encies in fulfi@@ lling the Copenhagen criteria , highli@@ ghted by the election @-@ related abuse on November 28 .
as a H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian dele@@ g@@ ate , I feel obli@@ g@@ ated to list the temporary exemp@@ tions in the field of environmental protection that Romania asked for .
H@@ un@@ gar@@ ians are ap@@ prehen@@ sive about these exemp@@ tions , as they would have a direct effect on the quality of water in H@@ un@@ g@@ ary and thus have requested that the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian Government re@@ open@@ ed c@@ hap@@ ters of environmental protection , which have just recently been closed .
it is exactly because of the un@@ certain@@ ties of such commitments that I would like to emphasise how important it is to monitor stric@@ tly the period between sig@@ ning the accession treaty and the actual time of accession .
if necessary , the processes of the two candidate countries should be separ@@ ated and they should receive individual per@@ for@@ man@@ ce @-@ based evaluation .
reg@@ ular progress chec@@ ks are very important , and Parliament must also take part in this process , so that by the time Romania join@@ s the Union , we can feel reas@@ su@@ red and conf@@ ident as to their prepar@@ ed@@ ness .
I bel@@ ong to those who most sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that our doub@@ ts will be sc@@ atte@@ red by Romania &apos;s positive per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in the ne@@ ar future .
Mr President , in my view , last S@@ un@@ day &apos;s presid@@ ential elections have indeed demonstrated that democracy in Romania is very vi@@ br@@ ant and is also working well .
this has not always been the case , and so we have every reason to be gra@@ ti@@ fied .
let us hope that the dyna@@ mic forces which have now been rele@@ ased will genuinely be chan@@ ne@@ lled into dri@@ ving forward the reforms and that the political process in Bu@@ char@@ est will not be ob@@ struc@@ ted .
all we can do is hope .
I was a member of the Del@@ e@@ gation to the EU @-@ Romania J@@ o@@ int Parlia@@ mentary Committee from 1999 to 2004 .
if we compar@@ e 1999 and today , the country has obviously made substantial progress .
no@@ t@@ with@@ standing all the criticism in specific areas , it must be said that the previous government under An@@ as@@ ta@@ se achieved a great deal for Romania .
major progress has genuinely been made in many areas .
however , we cannot ignor@@ e the fact that the Roman@@ ians still have a lot to do .
not enough has been done to achieve the standards that apply throughout the European Union .
I can only repeat what many of my fellow Members have said : an independent judic@@ i@@ ary - which means a judic@@ i@@ ary which is independent of the execu@@ tive and individual political forces - is in fact a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for Romania &apos;s cooperation within the EU .
there is still some ground to be made up here .
I also hope that cor@@ ruption can be comb@@ ated more effectively .
cor@@ ruption is ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y at the expen@@ se of Romania &apos;s citizens , and the new President has ple@@ d@@ ged major anti @-@ cor@@ ruption measures which will h@@ ope@@ fully target not only the &apos; small f@@ ry &apos; but also the big fish .
cor@@ ruption must be tac@@ kl@@ ed ir@@ respec@@ tive of position or status , for it is the@@ ft from the Roman@@ ian people .
in my view , it would be quite wrong for Romania or the EU to create new obstacles at this point in time .
the negotiations should be concluded , and I would like to thank Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , the rapporteur , for pres@@ enting such an excellent report .
2007 must be the date when we welcome Romania into the European family , and thus integra@@ te it into European standards as well .
Mr President , let me be clear .
I am very much in favour of Romania acc@@ eding , but all in good time and prefer@@ ably in accordance with the agreements made .
in order to complete the negotiations , it simply needs to fulfil the pres@@ cri@@ bed conditions and criteria , so it is quite beyond me why the Commission should , with a stra@@ ight face , claim that Romania meet@@ s the Copenhagen political criteria , while at the same time it reports exten@@ sively on the influence the execu@@ tive power exer@@ ts over the outcome of court cases and confir@@ ms that cor@@ ruption is still ri@@ f@@ e and discrimination - including that against the Rom@@ a - is still very much on the agenda .
it appears that this House &apos;s rapporteur , too , does not have any problem with sta@@ ting in the first paragraph of his report that Romania meet@@ s the political criteria , while going on , later on in the report - and rightly so - to express his concern about a few crucial points .
the rapporteur goes on to draw the conclusion - which I regard as im@@ prob@@ able - that a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations before the end of 2004 is both des@@ ira@@ ble and fe@@ asi@@ ble .
my common sense lead@@ s me to a completely different conclusion , namely that Romania has not gone that far yet and , consequently , negotiations cannot be concluded satisfac@@ tor@@ ily before the end of 2004 .
we have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose .
our Amendments Nos 6 and 25 are also important ; Amendment No 6 under@@ lines that the progress of all candidate countries is dependent on the assessment of their own mer@@ its and that it is for this reason that the use of individual accession agreements as a basis for the accession of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia is recommend@@ ed .
amendment No 25 does the necessary job of bringing paragraph 1 of the report back into line with reality .
I sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that we can coun@@ t on your support so that we can get through to the European Council before it is too late , because it has just been confirmed again that the Council has now comple@@ ted the for@@ mal negotiations with Romania .
it follows that this debate and tomorrow &apos;s vote are sta@@ ged per@@ for@@ man@@ ces , but , before the accession agreement is signed in the s@@ pring of 2005 , Parliament must give its express approval , and I do not see that as being by any means a .
I would see it as a good thing if this House were to speak out clearly about the pre@@ ma@@ ture and arti@@ fic@@ ial clos@@ ure of the negotiations with Romania , if it were to be able to put a stop to the considerable ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ar@@ in@@ ess in the enlargement process and if it were to keep to the agreements made .
the working method that we now see in the process with Romania will , so@@ on@@ er or later , result in the ero@@ sion of our community based on the rule of law and in the wea@@ ken@@ ing of the Union .
Mr President , the June Lis@@ t will welcome Romania and Bulgar@@ ia as Members of the European Union , just as we shall welcome Turkey , the countries of the W@@ estern Balkans and , in time , Ukraine and , h@@ ope@@ fully , Belarus .
at the same time , we wish to war@@ n of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term - poor and econom@@ ically un@@ developed countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving cor@@ ruption .
the EU is construc@@ ted for econom@@ ically developed countries with stable democra@@ cies and only moder@@ ate problems with cor@@ ruption .
the enlargement involving ten countries that has just been carried out and of which the June Lis@@ t was a sinc@@ ere suppor@@ ter is , already for its part , ca@@ using problems .
accep@@ ting poor countries such as Romania into an EU that continues to operate an ab@@ sur@@ d agricultural policy and a poor@@ ly managed structural policy and that is itself w@@ res@@ t@@ ling with difficulties in preventing waste and cor@@ ruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project .
it might also prove dangerous for Romania .
there would be a significant risk of a bra@@ in dra@@ in .
enter@@ ing the EU &apos;s agricultural system and being loc@@ ked ti@@ ghtly into an economic structure without a future would also be a big dis@@ advantage .
the election that has just taken place was , however , a big success for democracy in Romania , but both Romania and the EU countries have reasons to wait and see and not to pus@@ h for pre@@ ma@@ ture accession .
it may be in the interests of both parties not to r@@ us@@ h into full membership .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , for giving us a balanced report , which points out the advan@@ ces made by Romania in recent years .
Bar@@ on@@ ess N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son of W@@ inter@@ bour@@ ne did well to rec@@ all the position from which Romania started and the reasons that have made progress so difficult for that country .
even so , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i has also pointed out the lim@@ ita@@ tions and short@@ com@@ ings that character@@ ise Romania &apos;s situation today .
some Members from countries that join@@ ed the European Union on 1 May this year have called for greater sever@@ ity .
I should like them to r@@ ere@@ ad what was said in this Chamber before their countries join@@ ed , when we were looking at how far they had prog@@ res@@ sed on their path towards join@@ ing the Union .
in all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ o@@ od they still had considerable short@@ com@@ ings at that stage but , even so , it was thought appropriate that they should be allowed to join at the agreed time .
in the case of Romania , we also have a safeguard clause , which was not provided in the other cases .
I therefore believe it is only fair to give that country the chance to do its ut@@ most over the next two years so that it can be ready when the time comes to actually join our Union .
there is no doubt that there are to@@ pic@@ s about which our fellow citizens are concerned , the most important of which is the ina@@ dequ@@ acy of the fight against organised crime .
if we were to ask people in the stre@@ ets of our countries to say how af@@ ra@@ id they often felt of criminal gan@@ gs , we would surely be inc@@ lined to encourage the Roman@@ ian Government to do more in that direction .
as Mr Le@@ inen rightly rec@@ all@@ ed , the fight against cor@@ ruption is wid@@ es@@ pread in the countries join@@ ing our Union .
I should also like to tou@@ ch on the to@@ pic of children .
this is a subject that I have addressed exten@@ sively in recent years , together with Bar@@ on@@ ess N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son .
child protection issues need to be placed at the heart of our thinking .
I believe , however , that the proposal put forward by the rapporteur of having an international com@@ mission is a good solution .
if we want to prevent those children from spending their ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence and y@@ outh on the stre@@ ets of our c@@ ities or sh@@ ut up in institutions , we have to take into account the do@@ z@@ ens of families that have already made contact with them and would lo@@ ve to be able to give them affec@@ tion .
let us therefore welcome Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i &apos;s sugges@@ tion to that effect .
lastly , Mr President , we need to consider the importance of stability .
we shall see whether the outcome of the recent elections in Bu@@ char@@ est will lead to political stability .
I believe that that is what we all wish for , because only with stability can there be any hope of seeing Romania ready to meet its commitments .
ladies and gentlemen , I started my care@@ er as a te@@ ac@@ her of modern languages , and when I was mar@@ king ex@@ am@@ s or hom@@ e@@ work I realis@@ ed that I would become increasingly har@@ s@@ h as I w@@ ent on , and that I would be much tou@@ gh@@ er on the last paper@@ s than I had been on the first - to such a point that I would take another look at the first ones to make sure that I had been suffici@@ ently fair .
lis@@ tening to this debate and hear@@ ing what some Members have to say , and also rec@@ all@@ ing this morning &apos;s debate , I wonder whether we are not experienc@@ ing something similar here , because it seems to me that we are becoming increasingly har@@ s@@ h with each enlargement .
is this to say that there are no problems ?
of course not .
I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they li@@ e , and said that considerable improvements are essential .
ladies and gentlemen , I am fair@@ ly well acqu@@ ain@@ ted with Romania and have had the opportunity on several occasions to urge those in positions of authority from all political sides to speed up work on implementing the reforms and trans@@ pos@@ ing the necessary legislation and regulation .
like the majority of the members of my group , I will be voting in favour of the recommendations in the M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i report .
I will be doing so not only because of my feel@@ ings for Romania , where I have many excellent friends , but also because , having visi@@ ted the country as long ago as February 199@@ 0 and seen f@@ res@@ h evidence of the violence of the end of the previous year , I can fully appreciate how far it has already come .
we o@@ we our friends understanding and fri@@ end@@ ship , but not wea@@ k or almost in@@ different ind@@ ul@@ g@@ ence .
this has always been my attitude towards Romania , and it remains my attitude today .
my positive attitude remains fundamenta@@ lly an attitude of vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant fri@@ end@@ ship .
I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that more hon@@ es@@ ty is called for .
I am most grateful to Mr L@@ agen@@ di@@ j@@ k for his demand in this respect , even though we have arri@@ ved at different conclusions for Turkey .
he is absolutely right : we must demand hon@@ es@@ ty in relation to Romania as well .
in my view , this obviously means that we must dis@@ pen@@ se with a few of our do@@ g@@ mas .
the first is that dead@@ lines which have been mo@@ o@@ ted at some point in the past are now regar@@ ded as more sa@@ c@@ red than the progress made or the re@@ alities of the situation .
let me be b@@ l@@ un@@ t . we will not do ourselves any fav@@ ours if we ab@@ ide by 1 January 2007 as a date for Romania &apos;s accession .
secondly - and Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I am direc@@ ting these remarks specifically to you , as we had the ple@@ asure of discussing the budget , among other things , with you - we are talking about a period for which we still have no budget , as we have yet to adopt a new Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive to cover the period from 1 January 2007 .
if you cl@@ ing to your second do@@ g@@ ma , namely the fig@@ ure of 1 % , we will be unable to c@@ ope with this financial burden .
we cannot ar@@ gue that Europe is continu@@ ally ex@@ pan@@ ding and its agenda is becoming longer , while money is becoming increasingly ti@@ ght .
please be hon@@ est and make it clear that there is no funding .
we need to negoti@@ ate the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive first , and then we will see whether everything ad@@ ds up .
thirdly - and again , let me be b@@ l@@ un@@ t - I have heard every speak@@ er talk about the problems which we still have to overcome , not us , that is , but Romania , namely cor@@ ruption , democracy and the rule of law .
just what do we mean when we talk about membership of the European Union ?
is this not the pre@@ condition , as we lear@@ ned today at noon ?
according to the majority of Members of this House , this is not the pre@@ condition for the opening of negotiations .
I take a different view .
ultimately , however , before we are han@@ ded an accession treaty - and we have been told that this will be available within the next six months - everything has to be in place .
we are dec@@ eiv@@ ing ourselves if we proceed on the basis that monitoring processes and c@@ laus@@ es which are buil@@ t in but will never come into force because they require unanim@@ ity in the Council are enough to justi@@ fy our confidence and conv@@ in@@ ce us that everything will work out just fine .
that is why I am appe@@ al@@ ing to you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , in relation to the draf@@ ting of the presidency conclusions on F@@ rid@@ ay .
I realise that you have a problem in that you have little to show for your presidency .
however , no one is re@@ pro@@ ac@@ hing you : during the six months in which you held the presidency , Europe was operating bel@@ ow pa@@ r .
we had the European elections , and then it took some time for the Commission to be ap@@ pointed and confirmed in office .
no one can bla@@ me the presidency for this .
however , you are responsible for ensuring that we do not dec@@ eive ourselves every six months .
that means that we should not claim , in Council documents , that significant progress has been made and improvements have yet again been achieved when this is not the case .
I therefore appeal to you to be hon@@ est when you draw up the presidency conclusions on F@@ rid@@ ay .
I appeal to the House as well : let us take an hon@@ est vote on this issue tomorrow .
Mr President , we like to talk about a Europe of values .
how does this f@@ it with the decision to ad@@ mit Romania to the European Union in just two years time unless by some chance there should be a de@@ fer@@ ral of just 12 months , which har@@ dly seems likely given that we have heard today that the Council has over@@ rid@@ den the Commission &apos;s concerns in clos@@ ing c@@ hap@@ ters , a de@@ pl@@ or@@ able example of over principle of which the Dutch presidency should be as@@ ha@@ med .
one of my colleagues said that we are being too sever@@ e on Romania .
how so@@ ft does she want us to be ?
on the Commission &apos;s own ad@@ mission , Romania su@@ ff@@ ers from serious and wid@@ es@@ pread cor@@ ruption ; it has a judic@@ i@@ ary which is neither efficient nor independent ; it does not pos@@ s@@ ess genuine media freedom ; it cannot implement the at local and regional level ; it fail@@ s to prevent money la@@ under@@ ing ; it per@@ m@@ its the ill @-@ treatment of pris@@ oners in cus@@ to@@ dy ; it fail@@ s to en@@ force laws against child and sexual trafficking .
yet this is a country appar@@ ently now so close to meeting EU values that we are putting it on a certain course to accession .
it is not surpris@@ ing that the EU may stand acc@@ used of being unable to say &apos; no &apos; to anyone when it s@@ ets its si@@ ghts so low .
the Commissioner says , and I quo@@ te from his recent parliamentary answer : &apos; it seems likely that Romania &apos;s future progress will be acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated by its accession to the EU &apos; .
however , neither he nor any of us know whether that will prove true .
so far we have been lu@@ ck@@ y : membership of the European Union has ten@@ ded to make bad appl@@ es wh@@ oles@@ ome but perhaps we will reach the point where the bad appl@@ es inf@@ ec@@ t the rest .
you only have to look at Li@@ thu@@ ania , ne@@ ar the top of the world le@@ ag@@ ue for cor@@ ruption , or to the United Kingdom , loc@@ king up people without charge or trial , to realise that Europe can very easi@@ ly allow its values to be bet@@ ra@@ yed from within .
we do not have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with existing Member States that qui@@ et@@ ly reject the principles of good governance .
perhaps the Commissioner can take a lead in building such a mechanism .
I wish the new Roman@@ ian Government well .
the results of last S@@ un@@ day &apos;s election give hope for reform , although the result was no thanks either to the Commission or the Council , both of which played right into the hands of the former c@@ yn@@ ical government .
Romania &apos;s problems run de@@ ep .
once applic@@ ants are allowed through the EU do@@ or , the Commission is de@@ pri@@ ved of its best weapons to secure change .
instead of using the opportunity to apply maximum pressure to gain reform , we seem determined to set it on a con@@ ve@@ y@@ or bel@@ t to autom@@ atic accession .
Romania should join the European Union , but it should do when it meet@@ s the values of the EU .
it would be a gra@@ ve mis@@ take to set a date for accession now .
- Mr President , ma@@ y@@ be Bulgar@@ ia and Romania are being wr@@ ong@@ ed by our deb@@ ating Turkey &apos;s accession pros@@ pects over the last few days in the European Parliament - and shall also be doing so in the European Union , at the European Council , in a few days &apos; time .
I believe that fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ts on the subject of Turkey are over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing both the expression and the w@@ ei@@ ghting of our political word .
I should like to start by referring to a top@@ ical matter , the fin@@ alisation yesterday of the results of the elections in Romania .
the new President has been na@@ med and the results of the election have been accepted by his fellow candidate , putting an end to any dispu@@ tes relating to the elector@@ al process .
nonetheless , the new President will have to achieve the strong bac@@ king of parliament if he is to hon@@ our immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union .
given the almost balanced presence of the main political forces in the Roman@@ ian parliament , cooperation amongst everyone and serious joint efforts will be needed for the successful contin@@ uation of European integration .
ladies and gentlemen , by my reading , Romania has made significant progress , especially in such a short space of time , in coming into line with political and economic accession criteria .
nonetheless , we should not over@@ look the need for further ra@@ dical reform , foc@@ using on the efficient combating of cor@@ ruption and changes in the public administration and in the judicial system , in the aim of sec@@ uring truly independent justice .
in addition , further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls , asylum and immigration policy and more d@@ ras@@ tic action to combat organised crime and cor@@ ruption .
at economic level , it is considered necessary , , to safeguard ma@@ cr@@ o @-@ economic stability , ra@@ tion@@ alise the role of the state in the economy and introduce efficient regional and rural development policies and policies for greater regional integration and cooperation with the countries of s@@ outh @-@ eas@@ tern Europe .
my personal app@@ ra@@ is@@ al is that , with the support of the European Commission and with the pre@@ condition , of course , of more inten@@ se effort , it is fe@@ asi@@ ble that Romania will be able to comply more fully with the criteria and the values and principles of the Union and sign an accession agreement at the same time as Bulgar@@ ia .
Mr President , firstly I wish to thank my colleague , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , for an excellent report , and one that takes account of different points of view .
candidate countries must be treated equally and fair@@ ly .
Romania must fulfil the conditions imposed on it , just as the others did when they acc@@ ed@@ ed to the Union .
we are not s@@ tri@@ ving for perfec@@ tion here : n@@ one of the present Member States of the Union is perfec@@ t .
problems have been mentioned here today relating to Romania &apos;s home affairs and issues of justice .
Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u , w@@ inn@@ er of the Roman@@ ian presid@@ ential elections , promis@@ ed the Roman@@ ians in his vic@@ tory speech an un@@ su@@ ll@@ ied administration and an independent civil service .
this promis@@ e must be taken seriously and must be fulfi@@ lled .
we have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms .
I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting human rights in the future .
attention should not just be paid to the vi@@ ability of public administration : human rights issues are at least as important , if not more so .
trafficking in human beings is something for which there must be z@@ ero toler@@ ance , both in Romania and elsewhere in Europe .
unfortunately , even the credibility of the present Member States su@@ ff@@ ers on this issue .
we cannot establish a mar@@ gin of toler@@ ance for trafficking in human beings : it has to be completely prohi@@ bi@@ ted .
Romania also needs support in its implementation of the new law on child protection .
finally , I wish to express my thanks to Commissioner R@@ eh@@ n , as he has promis@@ ed to keep Parliament very well informed .
in my opinion , that is a very important point .
Romania should be ready for membership , but the current Member States should also be ready to accept Romania as a member , and dialogue between the Commission and Parliament can only further that endeav@@ our .
- Mr President , the Roman@@ ian people have just voted a different political party into power for the second time since the re@@ v@@ olution .
does this not prove that democracy is working in this country , which has suffer@@ ed under both dicta@@ tor@@ ship and commun@@ ism ?
that is why Romania cannot be compared to other countries , because the after @-@ effects of this tw@@ of@@ old op@@ pression are still being felt .
it will take several more gener@@ ations before the ins@@ an@@ e decisions of a dicta@@ tor and a sec@@ ret police , the , ce@@ ase to affect how people be@@ have .
our report does not mention the issue of the , which nevertheless pres@@ ents a significant problem in terms of human resources .
in fact , Romania has not yet emer@@ ged from this difficult period .
Mr President , have we considered that the young people who were bor@@ n after the dicta@@ tor@@ ship have not yet reached the age of majority ?
where is this nation to find un@@ tain@@ ted , independent staff , who have not been close to the dicta@@ tor , who have not bel@@ ong@@ ed to the commun@@ ist or been part of the to f@@ ill pos@@ ts in these administra@@ tions and thus ensure that they are independent , which is what we require ?
the progress made towards accession to the European Union should be considered from two different vie@@ w@@ points : the desire of the political cl@@ ass@@ es for change and the ability to achieve it in practice .
the proposal to delay Romania &apos;s accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficul@@ ty , and I actually find it extremely ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
it is only 15 years since the re@@ v@@ olution in Romania , which could just as easi@@ ly have led to a civil war .
we must therefore hope that President Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u succ@@ eed@@ s in form@@ ing a co@@ al@@ ition that has the national interest at heart , rather than the prof@@ ile of the different political parties .
although President I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u and President Con@@ stan@@ tin@@ es@@ c@@ u , a one @-@ time member of this European People &apos;s Party , have not managed to put in place all of the necessary reforms , we must nevertheless acknowledge that they have brought rela@@ tive institutional stability to the country .
let us then , rather than playing the scho@@ ol@@ mas@@ ter , have some respect for the efforts already made and acc@@ ura@@ tely ass@@ ess what remains to be done .
Mr President , 2007 will in any case be a great year for Romania because in 2007 a Roman@@ ian c@@ ity , S@@ i@@ bi@@ u , will share the t@@ it@@ le of European C@@ ap@@ ital of C@@ ul@@ ture with Luxemb@@ our@@ g .
this proposal was made by the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Government , and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Ministers and the Commission .
the rich mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural and mul@@ ti@@ e@@ th@@ nic Roman@@ ian her@@ ita@@ ge will certainly en@@ rich the culture of Europe , and Romania should also be seen from the point of view of its cultural ric@@ hes and the potential of its population , which has been b@@ ad@@ ly br@@ u@@ ised by the ma@@ d@@ ness of a dicta@@ tor and the dama@@ ging effects of a tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian ide@@ ology .
Mr President , this morning I voted in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey .
I am also in favour of Romania &apos;s accession , and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality .
I believe that our rapporteur has drawn the right conclusions in his report , and I am grateful to him .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i for his excellent report .
with the accession of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia , the fif@@ th round of enlargement will have been implemented , creating a larg@@ er , democratic Europe , which will take its place on the world political stage as a place of great promis@@ e and prof@@ ound concerns , dist@@ ing@@ uis@@ hed by being the Europe of citiz@@ en@@ ship .
Europe is thus not just a free @-@ market and free trade area with a single currency , but above all it has the ability and desire to peace@@ fully export the model consis@@ ting of the rule of law , protection of minorities and human rights , sustainable development , as well as an economy and finan@@ ces that are efficient and designed to promote cohesion .
that is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Treaty and the Nice Charter aff@@ ir@@ m .
we therefore welcome the succ@@ esses and ste@@ ad@@ y improvement that Romania has achieved in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the various fields , as Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i has indicated , emphas@@ ising , , its respect for its minorities , both H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian and Rom@@ a .
Romania must , however , make rapid progress to fulfil all the accession commitments , especially in the area of the Community .
structural measures are not enough to combat poverty .
cor@@ ruption also needs to be f@@ ought through preven@@ tive measures and all laws need to be en@@ forced .
lastly , we feel that the improvement of legislation on child protection and international adop@@ tions is a positive step .
regarding the latter area , I would call on the Roman@@ ian authorities to find an immediate solution to the problem of adop@@ tions h@@ it by dela@@ ys , which are de@@ pri@@ ving children of the families to which they are entitled .
in the name of that univers@@ al right , which is one of the strong points of the Constitutional Treaty , and in addition to the creation of an international com@@ mission to start work stra@@ ight away , I call on the new@@ ly @-@ elected Roman@@ ian authorities not to waste preci@@ ous time and , for Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas , to give those children the par@@ ents that already lo@@ ve them and with whom they can build a better future in a peaceful Europe .
.
Mr President , I will be brief .
I have heard many positive remarks , most of which I agree with .
of course , there were also many concerns expressed , many of which I also agree with .
there were some critical remarks , with which I do not agree , from Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er , Mr L@@ agen@@ di@@ j@@ k and others , that Romania is not ready to close the negotiations .
I emphasise that we , as a presidency and as a Council , base our position on the assessment of the European Commission .
Romania is not ready for accession , which is why we feel it is important to have two more years to achieve the whole framework for the negotiations , as we discussed before , with ex@@ tra guarantees and ex@@ tra safegu@@ ards .
in response to Mr L@@ agen@@ di@@ j@@ k &apos;s remarks , we do not need unanim@@ ity in the Council for using this ex@@ tra safeguard clause - the possibility of post@@ pon@@ ing the accession for a maximum of a year .
no , precisely in the area of justice and home affairs which he men@@ tions - as many members did - and also in the sensitive area of competition , we only need a qualified majority for using the ex@@ tra safeguard clause .
the rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , Mr M@@ ei@@ j@@ er and others made some remarks about sig@@ n@@ als from Romania that the presid@@ ent @-@ elec@@ t wants to rene@@ goti@@ ate the results .
the presid@@ ent @-@ elec@@ t seems to have no@@ tic@@ ed critical remarks about the idea of re@@ opening some c@@ hap@@ ters .
we lear@@ ned from Bu@@ char@@ est that Mr Bas@@ es@@ c@@ u is emphas@@ ising the efforts to be made before January 2007 , which leave no room for re@@ opening the final results of the negotiations .
in a short reply to Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er about the financial consequences of accession , I repeat what I said about Bulgar@@ ia .
the financial consequences are already ar@@ ran@@ ged in the financial package for 2007 @-@ 200@@ 9 , ir@@ respec@@ tive of the new financial perspective .
let me conclude with my compl@@ im@@ ents to Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i .
his report addres@@ ses all the important areas in a constructive and even @-@ han@@ ded way .
.
Mr President , I wish to join the President @-@ in @-@ office of the Council in thanking Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i , and I would like to make one or two comments and reply to those questions that have been raised in this debate .
firstly , Mr T@@ ab@@ aj@@ di said he appreci@@ ated the Commission &apos;s objec@@ ti@@ vity and im@@ parti@@ ality .
I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in future this should be a guid@@ ing principle in all enlargement policy .
my view is that after last year &apos;s major s@@ et@@ back we shall now be proceed@@ ing gradu@@ ally and ste@@ ad@@ ily in terms of the enlargement of the European area of peace and democracy .
our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradu@@ al , ste@@ ad@@ y , careful and thorou@@ gh .
in this regard , I understand in general the views expressed by Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er .
it is a p@@ ity he did not have time to hear my reply .
as Mr F@@ er@@ b@@ er deman@@ ded hon@@ es@@ ty of the EU , that is to say ourselves , I agree that we should ass@@ ess the effects of all decisions taken on enlargement and that we need to ad@@ here to the criteria .
it is for that very reason that we have proposed a safeguard clause in the c@@ hap@@ ters relating to justice and home affairs and competition .
this safeguard clause may be adopted by qualified majority , which makes it credi@@ ble , and it will encourage Romania to work and s@@ tri@@ ve to achieve results .
several speakers have also quite rightly given attention to the challenges that li@@ e ahead for Romania , including improving the environment and the status of minorities as well as promoting the fight against cor@@ ruption and crime .
these are areas we continu@@ ally monitor and will return to in detail when the Mon@@ itoring Re@@ port comes out next autu@@ m@@ n .
it is then that we shall evalu@@ ate the progress that has been made over the months to come .
Romania &apos;s new government will have a g@@ ol@@ den opportunity to demonstrate that it can genuinely fulfil its commitments and reform the country &apos;s society and institutions .
Mr D@@ avi@@ es and Mrs J@@ ä@@ ä@@ tte@@ en@@ m@@ ä@@ ki pointed out that the current Member States also have much to do to develop the rule of law .
one can only agree with this .
these issues , however , do not fall within the competence of the Commissioner for En@@ larg@@ ement . rather , it would be better to address these problems via the inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ement procedure or present a case using the ma@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y of the European Court of Human Rights .
in conclusion , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i . I agree with the view expressed by both him and Mr S@@ z@@ ent @-@ I@@ v@@ á@@ n@@ y that it is in the interests of both the European Union and Romania that Romania is ready by 2007 .
this in the first instance depen@@ ds on Romania &apos;s willingness and ability to reform the country and its society .
the Commission , for its part , will give all the support it can to ensure that Romania strength@@ ens its efforts so as to pre @-@ emp@@ t the use of the safeguard c@@ laus@@ es referred to just now .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m. tomorrow .
the next item is questions to the Council ( B@@ 6 @-@ 01@@ 36 / 2004 ) .
we shall consider a number of questions .
I should first like to clarify the following : according to our Rules of Procedure , when a Member who is sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to ask a question cannot be here , he or she must personally request a re@@ pla@@ cement to speak on his or her behalf .
accord@@ ingly , the B@@ ure@@ au cannot accept re@@ pla@@ c@@ ements by third parties , such as political group sec@@ re@@ ta@@ ries @-@ general .
the requests for re@@ pla@@ cement by the Members who asked Ques@@ tions Nos 4 and 7 , Mr A@@ yl@@ ward and Mr R@@ y@@ an , are therefore not accepted , and if at the time of the questions concerned those Members are not here , the questions will be de@@ em@@ ed to have lap@@ sed .
before you answer the first question , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , I should in any case like to remind the House what Mr V@@ id@@ al @-@ Qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ s told us this morning - that this sitting must fin@@ ish today at 6@@ .30 p.m. , due to commitments that the Council &apos;s representative cannot post@@ p@@ one .
many businesses from the new Member States which im@@ port alu@@ min@@ ium from Russia and the C@@ I@@ S have appe@@ al@@ ed to their MEPs for action be taken to dro@@ p or reduce the 6 % duty , given that the economic situation in this b@@ ran@@ ch of Pol@@ ish industry has de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated signific@@ antly as a result , with higher production costs and higher product prices , leading to a fall in the competitiveness of Pol@@ ish companies in the har@@ s@@ h environment of the European market .
the option of bu@@ ying duty @-@ free alu@@ min@@ ium from countries which have appropriate agreements with the European Union is un@@ pro@@ fi@@ table for small and medium @-@ sized companies .
will the Council take urgent action to protect Pol@@ ish businesses threa@@ tened with clos@@ ure ?
the Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer it gave to question H @-@ 03@@ 9@@ 9 / 0@@ 4 , by R@@ ys@@ z@@ ard C@@ z@@ ar@@ nec@@ ki , during Ques@@ tion T@@ ime on 17 November 2004 , in which it suggested that the honourable Member should put his question to the Commission .
- Mr President , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , I should like to inform you that I put my question to the European Commission , but regretta@@ bly I did not receive a satisfactory answer .
with your per@@ mission , I should like to make known my dis@@ satisfac@@ tion at the al@@ arm@@ ing mu@@ d@@ dle that exists with regard to this issue , as well as the bureauc@@ ratic h@@ ur@@ d@@ les , which may well be inten@@ tional .
it is no easy task to identi@@ fy exactly which body is competent to take decisions regarding alu@@ min@@ ium impor@@ ts from Russia and the countries bel@@ ong@@ ing to the Com@@ mon@@ we@@ alth of In@@ dependent States .
Pol@@ and has repe@@ a@@ tedly applied to the European Commission for these custom@@ s du@@ ties to be reduced , yet unfortunately its appl@@ ications have been rejected without ad@@ duc@@ ing any clear or material reasons .
this is why , Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , I am appe@@ al@@ ing to you and asking you to take action on this issue , so as to help both Pol@@ ish ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ s and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ s from other countries .
. this issue , I repeat , is really the exclu@@ sive competence of the Commission , so I cannot answer the question .
on 29 October 2004 , the P@@ yr@@ en@@ é@@ es @-@ Mediterranean Euro@@ region was established , comp@@ ris@@ ing Ca@@ tal@@ onia , Ara@@ g@@ on , the Bal@@ ear@@ ic Is@@ lands , M@@ id@@ i @-@ P@@ yr@@ en@@ é@@ es and Lan@@ gu@@ ed@@ o@@ c @-@ R@@ ous@@ si@@ ll@@ on , as an area of in@@ ter @-@ regional cooperation on rail@@ way infrastructure , a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics , log@@ is@@ tics , innovation and research , and with the stated intention of opening its do@@ ors to new regions .
the Euro@@ region does not have , nor will it have , any political content whatever , since this is al@@ i@@ en to the very concept of the new legal entity created , whose efforts are direc@@ ted towards the kind of cooperation described above .
what role will the European Union acknowledge this Euro@@ region as having , and more specifically , what involvement will the EU give it in join@@ ing up Community policies ? what management and monitoring powers will the EU grant it with regard to Community funding already granted and to be granted to the regional promotion and development of the P@@ yr@@ en@@ é@@ es @-@ Mediterranean Euro@@ region ?
. the Council rec@@ all@@ s that Council Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 60 / 1999 , la@@ ying down general provisions on the structural funds , s@@ ets out the Community initiatives as one of the instruments of regional policy within the framework of the structural funds .
in the current program@@ ming period of 2000 @-@ 2006 there are four Community initiatives .
one of them is Inter@@ re@@ g .
this cover@@ s cross @-@ border trans@@ national and inter@@ regional cooperation intended to encourage a harmon@@ ious , balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Community area .
Inter@@ re@@ g I@@ II has three sec@@ tions dealing respec@@ tively with cross @-@ border cooperation : the promotion of integrated regional development between bor@@ der@@ ing regions ; cross @-@ national cooperation , contribu@@ ting to an integrated and harmon@@ ious territory across the European Union ; and inter@@ regional cooperation to improve the policies and tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es of inter@@ regional economic development .
therefore , the P@@ yr@@ ene@@ es / Mediterranean Euro@@ region could benefit from the support of this Community initiative , subject to the procedures established by the Commission .
the Council also rec@@ all@@ s that the Commission has proposed the creation of an instrument called &apos; European group@@ ings of cross @-@ border cooperation &apos; .
this would be given a legal person@@ ality to overcome the obstacles hin@@ der@@ ing cross @-@ border cooperation .
this proposal is currently being examin@@ ed by the prepar@@ atory bodies within the Council and also has to be considered by the European Parliament within the framework of the codecision procedure .
I would like to point out that there are more than a hun@@ d@@ red Euro@@ regions in Europe and that , in fact , through the im@@ pe@@ tus of IN@@ T@@ E@@ R@@ R@@ E@@ G , the Community initiative which is right now going also to become an objective , they are of particular interest .
I would like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council whether he believes that Euro@@ regions such as the P@@ yr@@ ene@@ es @-@ Mediterranean are fundamental , both in terms of promoting the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance of the borders which represent bar@@ riers to economic and social development , and in terms of giving substance to the principle of territor@@ ial cohesion , which is now en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the European Constitution , which has been signed by the 25 representatives of the Govern@@ ments of the Member States , and which therefore deser@@ ves every possible support from the Union ?
Mr President , we have , on occasions , received compla@@ ints from the European regions that it is the Govern@@ ments of the States that distribu@@ te the C@@ oh@@ es@@ ion Funds and also the regional element of the Structural Funds , and on occasions those regions of the same political c@@ ol@@ our as the Government of the State receive fav@@ ourable treatment .
Mr Bar@@ ni@@ er , then Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy , announced to us an instrument which the regions could access directly without having to go through the Govern@@ ments of the States .
I do not know whether the initiative on European cross @-@ border cooperation group@@ ings , which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament , is the instrument Mr Bar@@ ni@@ er was referring to .
would the Council agree that the regions should have the possibility of acc@@ essing the funds directly without having to go through the Govern@@ ments of the States ?
. I tried to be comprehensive in my initial remarks , but I will add that Member States and regional and local authorities have experienc@@ ed major difficulties in car@@ rying out manag@@ ing actions of cross @-@ border cooperation , trans@@ national cooperation and inter@@ regional cooperation within the framework of differ@@ ing national laws and procedures .
that calls for appropriate measures at EU / Community level in order to reduce the difficulties .
harmon@@ ious development of the entire Community territory and reinfor@@ ced economic , social and territor@@ ial cohesion imp@@ ly enhan@@ ced cross @-@ border cooperation and the adoption of measures to improve the implementation conditions for cross @-@ border cooperation .
. in reply to the honourable Member the Council stres@@ ses that it has not al@@ tered its position following the US decision to recognise the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v Republic of Maced@@ onia under its constitutional name .
at the first meeting of the Sta@@ bil@@ isation and Association Council between the EU and the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v Republic of Maced@@ onia of September 2004 , the Council noted that the differences over the name of the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v Republic of Maced@@ onia per@@ sis@@ ted and encoura@@ ged the se@@ ar@@ ch for a mu@@ tually acceptable solution , within the framework of United Nations Security Council Res@@ olu@@ tions 8@@ 17 / 9@@ 3 and 8@@ 45 / 9@@ 3 , by Greece and the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v Republic of Maced@@ onia .
indeed , in a joint press statement of the EU @-@ W@@ estern Balkans For@@ um of November 2004 , the foreign ministers of both the EU and the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ v Republic of Maced@@ onia rec@@ all@@ ed the need for all partici@@ pan@@ ts to agree on finding mu@@ tually acceptable solutions and conclu@@ ding agreements on out@@ standing issues with neighbour@@ ing countries .
- Minister , allow me to respond with a suppl@@ ementary question : does the Council consider that this long @-@ out@@ standing issue of the name might create problems in the des@@ ira@@ ble further of this country towards the European institutions ?
what further action does the Council intend to take in order to per@@ su@@ ade the government of the F@@ Y@@ R@@ OM to maintain during talks in New Yor@@ k a more constructive stand in the negotiations to find a mu@@ tually acceptable solution ?
. that is more or less another question and I have nothing to add to what I have just said .
as the auth@@ or is not present , Ques@@ tion No 4 lap@@ ses .
could the Council indic@@ ate what efforts the European Union will make in the coming months to lob@@ by the American A@@ d@@ ministra@@ tion so that it comp@@ lies fully with the political obligations of the Kyoto Protocol ?
can the Council indic@@ ate clearly what international efforts will be undertaken by the European Union to ensure that all countries in the world comply with the clear and une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cal commitments of the Kyoto Protocol ?
if the European Union is to become more competitive , access to new technologies must be available to all communities in Europe .
the European Union is committed to implementing what is called the ID@@ A@@ B@@ C Programme , which is designed to promote the use of the Internet in public and government services .
this is part of the p@@ an @-@ European e@@ Government Ser@@ vic@@ es In@@ iti@@ ative .
can the European Council indic@@ ate what progress has been made in implementing this programme , which is such a central com@@ pon@@ ent to improving the availa@@ bility of information technologies in Europe ?
the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the implementation of the ID@@ A@@ B@@ C Programme fall@@ s within the re@@ mit of the Commission , which is assis@@ ted in this by the p@@ an @-@ European e@@ Government Ser@@ vic@@ es Committee .
the Council would also like to remind the honourable Member that the ID@@ A@@ B@@ C Programme decision will only enter into force on 1 January 2005 and thus the implementation of the programme as such has not yet started .
the Council invi@@ tes the honourable Member to refer this matter to the Commission for more details regarding the prepar@@ ation of the programme .
the Council is aware of two studies laun@@ ched by the Commission under the ID@@ A Programme .
one study aims to establish the needs and benefits to businesses and citizens of p@@ an @-@ European e@@ Government Ser@@ vic@@ es in order to reinfor@@ ce a properly ori@@ ented approach to the deli@@ very of a p@@ an @-@ European service .
the second one aims to identi@@ fy future infrastructure services needed to support the p@@ an @-@ European e@@ Government Ser@@ vic@@ es .
l@@ ike@@ wise , in the prepar@@ ation of the ID@@ A@@ B@@ C Programme , the Council also acknowled@@ ges the organisation of by Commission of a conference due to take place in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2005 , which will focus on the requirements for p@@ an @-@ European e@@ Government Ser@@ vic@@ es for citizens and businesses and on the factors needed to implement them .
I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his response .
the reason I put the question to him was because when this was orig@@ in@@ ally discussed as a programme , it came from the Council , and the Netherlands Government was one of the governments , together with the Irish Government , the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Government and the Italian Government , which were putting it forward as a proposal that should be pus@@ hed at Commission level .
following on from what you have said and what you know that the Commission is under@@ taking , are there any particular initiatives that the presidency wants to see carried forward from its presidency to the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to ensure that the role of this programme is fully implemented ?
. apart from these major actions , the ID@@ A Uni@@ t is preparing to laun@@ ch the programme fully during the first half of 2005 .
to that end , anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted activities are being analys@@ ed and for@@ ma@@ ts for work programme ent@@ ries , project implementation plans , et@@ c@@ . are being developed .
can the European Council indic@@ ate what measures have been taken to improve maritime safety and security in Europe since the Erika disaster , and can it clearly indic@@ ate what measures it is seeking to implement so as to improve maritime safety and security in the next few years ?
. as the Council has repe@@ a@@ tedly said , safety and security li@@ e at the heart of the European Union maritime policy .
measures to improve them , as well as to protect the mar@@ ine environment , represent the b@@ ul@@ k of legislation adopted in this area in the five years since the disaster .
in its response to this and other similar inc@@ idents , the Council has consisten@@ tly supported a du@@ al approach : on the one hand , incorpor@@ ating the provisions of international conven@@ tions into Community law and thus ensuring stric@@ ter compliance with the highest global standards and , on the other hand , adopting specific Community provisions wh@@ er@@ ever I@@ M@@ O standards are la@@ cking or in@@ sufficient .
in this way a comprehensive body of maritime safety legislation has been buil@@ t up and is continuing to ex@@ p@@ and .
amongst the specific measures adopted in the inter@@ medi@@ ate after@@ ma@@ th of the disaster , were firstly those under the Erika I package aimed at enhan@@ ced port state control to combat sub@@ standard ship@@ p@@ ing ; stric@@ ter monitoring of the classi@@ fication companies use to conduct safety chec@@ ks on ships ; and the acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated p@@ has@@ ing @-@ out of single @-@ h@@ ul@@ l oil tan@@ kers .
secondly , there were those under the Erika II package aimed at the establishment of a Community ves@@ se@@ l traffic monitoring and information system and the creation of a European Mar@@ itime S@@ af@@ ety Agency whose main role is to monitor the effectiveness of the EU maritime safety rules in general .
other measures include those designed to improve the safety of ships other than oil tan@@ kers , such as passeng@@ er vessels , to ensure a minimum level of se@@ af@@ ar@@ ers &apos; training and to reduce pollution from ships .
for improving security in the wa@@ ke of a number of terrorist ou@@ tra@@ ges , a regulation on enhan@@ cing ship and port facil@@ ities security was adopted earlier this year , incorpor@@ ating the S@@ O@@ L@@ A@@ S I@@ S@@ P@@ S measures into EU legislation and ex@@ pan@@ ding them to include domestic traffic .
currently under consideration by the Council are measures to implement the I@@ M@@ O International S@@ af@@ ety Man@@ ag@@ ement Co@@ de within the Community , so penal@@ ties can be imposed for certain pollution off@@ ences and port security enhan@@ ced .
finally , looking ahead , a new package of maritime safety measures is expected to be submitted for examin@@ ation by the Council in s@@ pring 2005 .
I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his reply .
could he give as@@ sur@@ an@@ ces therefore that in the future , depen@@ ding on the financial perspec@@ tives , there will be provision for maritime safety measures from the Union in the coming years ?
- Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the proposal for a directive to impose sanctions for mar@@ ine pollution remain@@ ed pen@@ ding during the Dutch Presidency because certain countries expressed dis@@ agreement , including Greece .
I am aware of the fact that Greece proposed certain amendments in order to accept this directive .
can the Council descri@@ be to us the content of these amendments which were tabled by the Greek Government ?
. the last question was a more or less new question .
this first question is also on another issue .
we will be having many discussions on the financial perspec@@ tives and this is one of the many issues we will discuss .
as you know , the Council has not decided anything on the new financial perspec@@ tives .
we have only taken an over@@ view of the so @-@ called building b@@ loc@@ ks and these building b@@ loc@@ ks reflect the different positions of the Member States to the Commission &apos;s proposals .
as the auth@@ or is not present , Ques@@ tion No 7 lap@@ ses .
can the Council indic@@ ate what funds have been dis@@ bur@@ sed by the European Union with a view to hal@@ ting the cul@@ ti@@ vation of drugs in Afghanistan for the year 2004 and what funds the European Council en@@ vis@@ ages that it will dis@@ bur@@ se in this specific policy area over the next two years ?
following the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on A@@ d@@ ministra@@ tive and Legal Co@@ operation for Consumer Pro@@ te@@ ction , does the Council have any plans to coordin@@ ate progress on Member State cooperation on sta@@ mp@@ ing out cross @-@ border fraud and ro@@ gue tra@@ ders operating dis@@ hon@@ est pri@@ z@@ e dra@@ ws , mis@@ leading market@@ ing and similar cross @-@ border crime ?
. Mr President , the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the en@@ for@@ cement of consumer protection laws - the so @-@ called Regulation on Consumer Pro@@ te@@ ction Co@@ operation - does not , as such , have any be@@ aring on law en@@ for@@ cement cooperation between Member States .
Member States &apos; police and judicial authorities are already actively co@@ operating in the fight against all types of crime .
the Council has adopted various instruments on cross @-@ border cooperation in the fight against crime , no@@ tably in the context of mutual recognition and en@@ for@@ cement .
these instruments , in principle , have a general scope and are not limited to specific types of crime .
that answer ill@@ ustra@@ tes why I asked the question .
this kind of crime affec@@ ts citizens from across the European Union ; it is an acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating form of crime .
Members in this House will know of people who have been sc@@ am@@ med , very often v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able European citizens - the el@@ der@@ ly , for instance .
will the presidency recognise that there are certain forms of crime which are naturally cross @-@ border issues ?
for example , I represent L@@ on@@ d@@ on , where much of this crime takes place , but people are being sc@@ am@@ med across the EU .
I should like to ask the Council to take seriously a form of crime that is not being dealt with across borders .
there is too little cooperation between Member States on this kind of growing crime and we know that our European citizens expect us , as parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans , to question you on how effective you can be in sol@@ ving this kind of cross @-@ border issue .
I want to reinfor@@ ce the points just made by my colleague .
as an ME@@ P I receive many let@@ ters from concerned constitu@@ ents who have been de@@ fra@@ ud@@ ed by people operating in other Member States of the European Union , particularly through fraud through fa@@ x ma@@ ch@@ ines , sen@@ ding fal@@ se contracts and fal@@ sel@@ y announ@@ cing pri@@ z@@ e @-@ draw w@@ inn@@ ers .
a lot of these are based in Luxemb@@ our@@ g , which will hold the next presidency of the EU .
fran@@ kly it brings the EU into dis@@ re@@ pu@@ te when we are told that there is nothing that can be done about this situation .
if citizens are to gain any advantage from EU cooperation , it should be precisely in tac@@ kl@@ ing these sor@@ ts of problems .
. we understand the problem and I take note of your remarks .
unfortunately I have nothing to add to what I said before .
in D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r , hun@@ dre@@ ds of people are d@@ ying each day from hun@@ ger , disease and continued violence , which shows no sig@@ ns of ab@@ ating .
70 000 people have already lost their lives and hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of lives are still at risk .
inno@@ cent civil@@ ians continue to be atta@@ c@@ ked and the number of dis@@ placed people is growing as people fle@@ e the violence .
the civil@@ ians live in constan@@ t fear of attack and rely on humanitarian assistance for food , water and means of sur@@ vi@@ val .
the ongoing violence and ins@@ ec@@ urity is seriously ha@@ m@@ per@@ ing the humanitarian effort , preventing access to many areas , thus au@@ g@@ men@@ ting the suffering and further ris@@ king the lives of these inno@@ cent people .
in light of the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this situation , what is being done by the Council to ensure that this crisis is placed and remains high on the agenda of the EU ?
what is the Council doing to ensure that the S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese Government is he@@ eding international law and the agreements signed with UN agencies ?
. from its out@@ set , at the beginning of the year , the D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r crisis has been one of the absolu@@ te priorities on the EU agenda .
throughout the year the European Union has been at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t of international efforts to contain and resolve the conflict in D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r , to stop the mas@@ sive human rights viol@@ ations taking place there and to prevent an already very serious humanitarian situation from de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating further .
Member States and the Community have contribu@@ ted to the humanitarian reli@@ ef efforts with more than EUR 3@@ 25 million .
the Union has also strongly supported the African Union &apos;s leading role in addres@@ sing the crisis .
the EU has thus played a key role in support of an A@@ U @-@ led ce@@ ase@@ fir@@ e monitoring mission and is now actively supporting the de@@ plo@@ yment of the ex@@ pan@@ ded mission .
almost 60 per cent of the total cost of the ex@@ pan@@ ded A@@ U mission is finan@@ ced by a contribution of some EUR 80 million from the peace fac@@ ility , and several Member States are providing additional financial and log@@ is@@ tical support for the mission as well as pl@@ ann@@ ers and military obser@@ vers .
the Council has repe@@ a@@ tedly , most recently on the occasion of its meeting on 22 November , confirmed its read@@ in@@ ess to continue to provide support for the de@@ plo@@ yment of the mission in terms of financing , log@@ is@@ tics and material , as well as person@@ nel if requested .
the Council considers that the de@@ plo@@ yment of the ex@@ pan@@ ded A@@ U mission in D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r , together with the EU @-@ led negotiations between the parties to find a political solution for D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r , off@@ ers an opportunity for a comprehensive solution to the D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r conflict .
in par@@ all@@ el to these efforts , the EU has contribu@@ ted to the pressure from the international community on all parties to guarantee free and un@@ cond@@ itional access for humanitarian aid and to ensure the security of the civil@@ ian population .
the Council is closely monitoring compliance by all parties with the demands expressed by the EU and the rest of the international community and the commitments it has undertaken with the UN .
to this end , the EU coll@@ abor@@ ates closely with the UN Secretary @-@ General &apos;s S@@ peci@@ al Re@@ pres@@ enta@@ tive for the S@@ ud@@ an and actively takes part in the work of the J@@ o@@ int I@@ m@@ pl@@ em@@ entation M@@ ec@@ han@@ ism that evalu@@ ates the implementation of the joint com@@ mu@@ ni@@ qu@@ é which consis@@ ts of the commitments of both the S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese Government and the United Nations .
in line with Res@@ olu@@ tions 15@@ 5@@ 6 and 15@@ 6@@ 4 of the UN Security Council , the Council has also on several occasions reite@@ ra@@ ted its willingness to take appropriate measures , including sanctions , if no progress is achieved on the commitments made by the S@@ ud@@ an@@ ese Government .
Mr President , I thank you for your out@@ line of the situation in the S@@ ud@@ an .
just today we have had ne@@ ws from the reli@@ ef agencies operating out of Ireland that the situation is worse , not better .
I should like to ask you to indic@@ ate when we might actually implement sanctions , as opposed to just threa@@ tening them .
over half a million people are now in di@@ re circumstances in the S@@ ud@@ an .
it may have gone from the head@@ lines , but the problem is still there .
. I agree .
as you may know , last Mon@@ day the Council also discussed the situation in S@@ ud@@ an and we are seriously concerned about the de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation of the security and humanitarian situation in D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r .
the Council therefore called on all parties to ab@@ ide in full by their commitments .
we also encoura@@ ged them to conclude the negotiations between the Government of S@@ ud@@ an and the S@@ P@@ L@@ M@@ A before the end of the year .
the Council will continue to monitor the situation in D@@ ar@@ fu@@ r and will consider taking appropriate measures , which could include sanctions in accordance with UN Security Council Res@@ olu@@ tions 15@@ 5@@ 6 and 15@@ 6@@ 5 if no tan@@ gible progress is achieved in this respect .
hence the situation is and remains high on the agenda of the European Union .
a tragic event recently took place in Sweden when a truc@@ k @-@ dri@@ ver who had just left the fer@@ ry in T@@ re@@ ll@@ e@@ bor@@ g sever@@ ely under the influence of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l dro@@ ve against the f@@ low of traffic and five people in two on@@ coming vehicles were ki@@ lled .
different appro@@ ac@@ hes to al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and different blood @-@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ l level limits in different European countries make it more difficult to deal with d@@ rin@@ k @-@ dri@@ vers and to prosecu@@ te them , especially in the case of cross @-@ border traffic .
in 2001 , on a proposal from the Commission , the Council decided to recommen@@ d that all Member States introduce a maximum blood @-@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ l level of 0@@ .@@ 2 pro@@ mi@@ lle for professional dri@@ vers .
the recommendation was adopted instead of a directive on a common up@@ per limit for dri@@ vers .
which countries have introduced that up@@ per limit to date ?
is the Council of Ministers re @-@ evalu@@ ating its recommendation and what is the outcome of the follow @-@ up at Community level provided for in that recommendation ?
up until now , the Council has not been informed of the outcome of such an evaluation .
that being so , the Council under@@ lines that these conclusions do not call specifically for the introduction of a maximum per@@ mitted blood @-@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ l content of 0@@ .@@ 2 m@@ g for professional dri@@ vers .
furthermore , the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that it does not have any information on how many Member States have introduced the a@@ fore@@ mentioned B@@ A@@ C levels so far .
however , the Council would like to draw the honourable Member &apos;s attention to the Commission recommendation of 6 April 2004 on en@@ for@@ cement in the field of road safety , which , in R@@ ec@@ om@@ mend@@ ation 6 , calls for an inten@@ si@@ fied application of ran@@ dom bre@@ ath tes@@ ting with an al@@ co@@ ho@@ l s@@ cre@@ ening de@@ vice as a leading principle for sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance of d@@ rin@@ k dri@@ ving .
the Council wants to ensure the honourable Member of its strong and ongoing commitment to improving road safety and to tac@@ kl@@ ing all potential sources of road accident fa@@ tal@@ ities .
in this context it ref@@ ers to the Council conclusions on road safety from June and December last year , both of which expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly refer to stric@@ ter en@@ for@@ cement , in particular se@@ at@@ bel@@ t use , spe@@ eding and d@@ rin@@ k dri@@ ving .
in the light of this ongoing commitment the Council had an exchange of views during its meeting on 9 and 10 December 2004 and adopted the Council conclusions on road safety , in which it agreed on the need to focus road safety policies in four important areas , namely en@@ for@@ cement and best practices , vehic@@ le safety , improving safety on European ro@@ ads and funding road safety .
in this context the Council under@@ lined that , with regard to road safety en@@ for@@ cement , priority should be given , no@@ tably , to dri@@ ver behaviour that causes high accident risks or could have sever@@ e consequences such as dri@@ ving under the influence of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
Mr President , I wish to thank the Council for its answer , but I am clearly un@@ happy to hear that the issue is fall@@ ing into a b@@ lack h@@ ole between the Commission and the Council .
there is every opportunity in this case for the Council to take the initiative .
we know that appro@@ xim@@ ately 10@@ .000 people di@@ e on the ro@@ ads each year because of dri@@ ving under the influence of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
we also know that commercial dri@@ ving is an important area when it comes to getting to g@@ ri@@ ps with d@@ rin@@ k @-@ dri@@ ving .
that is why this recommendation is important , and I see no reasons why the Member States should not take these initiatives .
the conclusions also include a paragraph about follow @-@ up , which would per@@ mit further discussions about enab@@ ling al@@ co@@ ho@@ l s@@ cre@@ ening de@@ vic@@ es to be introduced into c@@ ars .
this is a technical in@@ vention with which industry too works .
I should like to hear whether discussions are being conduc@@ ted in the Council about the possibility of introducing al@@ co@@ ho@@ l s@@ cre@@ ening de@@ vic@@ es into vehicles .
. I am sor@@ ry my answer did not satis@@ fy the honourable Member .
I thought I had expla@@ ined the many actions and things we , as a Council , have done to show our commitment to this issue .
we have to put our for@@ mal position into effect , as well as the for@@ mal position of the Council towards individual Member States .
as I tried to explain before , the matter is now in the hands of the Commission and we a@@ wait its evaluation and proposals .
the EU &apos;s as@@ pi@@ ration to trans@@ form itself into the most competitive economy in the world ( Lisbon Agenda ) calls for a significant increase in funding for European research policy .
research spending is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitu@@ tes investment in its sur@@ vi@@ val in a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely competitive international environment .
however , the declar@@ ed intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to re@@ conc@@ ile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact ( S@@ DP ) , which prohi@@ b@@ its Member States &apos; public expenditure from over@@ sho@@ o@@ ting a budget defic@@ it of 3 % of G@@ DP .
if the Member States are to have an inc@@ en@@ tive to set asi@@ de 1 % of G@@ DP for public funding of research policy , that perc@@ enta@@ ge should not be included in cal@@ cula@@ ting the c@@ eil@@ ing of 3 % of G@@ DP laid down by the S@@ DP .
does the Council agree that public spending on research constitu@@ tes top priority strategic expenditure for the EU and , as such , can justi@@ fi@@ ably be exclu@@ ded from the criteria under the Pact ?
the argument that such a decision will pa@@ ve the way for a h@@ ost of other excep@@ tions ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . military spending ) is not ten@@ able since the strengthening of research is an established European strategic goal which has no an@@ alo@@ gy with any other national or European objectives
. the Council no@@ tes that increasing overall expenditure on research is indeed a central element in the Lisbon strategy and one of the ke@@ ys to making the EU more competitive in the global economy .
the Council and Member States have repe@@ a@@ tedly committed themselves to achieving average research and development expenditure of 3 % of G@@ DP by 2010 .
the recent K@@ o@@ k report once again highli@@ ghted the need to make good the under @-@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in relation to this target .
no@@ t@@ with@@ standing this general statement , the Council does not share the honourable Member &apos;s view that it is the Stability and Growth Pact which is preventing Member States from achieving the Lisbon objective .
perhaps more fundamenta@@ lly , the Stability and Growth Pact should be used as a too@@ l to encourage national expenditure on individual budget com@@ pon@@ ents over and above others .
firstly , it is clearly possible to fund research while respec@@ ting the Pact .
this is a very important point that lead@@ s on to the second point that the Pact is not the factor lim@@ iting investment in research .
research funding is rather a matter of national priorities .
thirdly , I would note that the level of R &#91; am@@ p &#93; D expenditure is not sol@@ ely dependent on public finance .
the target cover@@ s priva@@ tely @-@ fun@@ ded R &#91; am@@ p &#93; D as well , which can be encoura@@ ged by a number of means in addition to public expenditure .
the key to reaching the 3 % target is the two thir@@ ds of R &#91; am@@ p &#93; D spending that should be priva@@ tely fun@@ ded , not the one third that should come from public funds .
finally , I would like to rec@@ all that the Pact is a framework for the management of budgetary policies at global level , with a view to ensuring the sustain@@ ability of public finan@@ ces over the longer term .
all expenditure has to be paid for , even if in the longer run we would hope that investment would have positive re@@ tur@@ ns .
when the E@@ co@@ fin Council discussed the Pact on 16 November 2004 and this precise issue was raised , there was a broad majority of Member States against pur@@ sing the possibility suggested by the Member and exclu@@ ding certain categ@@ or@@ ies of expenditure from defic@@ it cal@@ cula@@ tions .
in the an@@ al@@ y@@ tical assessment of the reasons for an excessive defic@@ it , the Council will always take into account the type of expenditure and the likely long @-@ term impact .
but the Council does not share the honourable Member &apos;s assessment regarding the exclusion of R &#91; am@@ p &#93; D expenditure from defic@@ it cal@@ cula@@ tions .
- Mr President , I might have agreed with everything Mr N@@ ic@@ ol@@ a@@ ï said if I did not believe that we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless research makes a great deal of progress .
thus , if the reply concerned any other subject , I would agree with you .
however , I regret that I must dis@@ agree because research is the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of Lisbon .
. only two EU Member States have already reached the Lisbon goal of 3 % of G@@ DP spent on R &#91; am@@ p &#93; D - Fin@@ land and Sweden .
they have achieved this by running budgetary sur@@ pl@@ uses .
it is clearly possible to fund research while respec@@ ting the Pact .
that is an important point .
second , even Germany and France with their well @-@ known budgetary problems have already achieved rates of 2@@ .@@ 5 % and 2@@ .@@ 2 % respec@@ tively .
again , it appears that the Pact is not the factor lim@@ iting investment in research .
it would appear to be a matter of national priorities .
that brings us to the end of Ques@@ tion T@@ ime .
we are also coming the end of the Dutch Presidency .
I believe that this is the last time that you will be with us for questions to the Council , Mr N@@ ik@@ ol@@ a@@ ï , and I should like to offer you my best wishes and thanks for your work with Parliament during your Presidency .
I wish you every success at the end of this period , particularly during the next few days , which , I have no doubt , will be extremely deman@@ ding .
questions Nos 12 to 31 will be answ@@ ered in wr@@ iting .
firstly , I must inform you that , following the invi@@ tations for the pres@@ entation of the candid@@ a@@ tures for the post of European Ombudsman , the dead@@ line for which was 30 September of this year , four candid@@ a@@ tures have been presented , of which two will be put forward , namely , those of Mr N@@ ik@@ i@@ fo@@ ro@@ s Di@@ aman@@ dou@@ ro@@ s and Mr G@@ i@@ us@@ ep@@ pe For@@ tu@@ na@@ to .
the candid@@ ates appe@@ ared before the competent committee on 29 November and the election will take place on 11 January next year , according to the procedure laid down in our Rules of Procedure .
the next item is the debate on the report by Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t on the proposal for a Council regulation amen@@ ding Regulation ( EC ) No 9@@ 7@@ 6 / 1999 la@@ ying down the requirements for the implementation of Community operations , other than those of development cooperation , which , within the framework of Community cooperation policy , contribute to the general objective of developing and consolid@@ ating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respec@@ ting human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at my hear@@ ing before the European Parliament some weeks ago , I spoke out in favour of developing the clos@@ est possible working relations between the Commission and the European Parliament on human rights and democ@@ rat@@ isation .
I would like to ren@@ ew this voluntary commitment wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly today .
the European Parliament is an extremely important part@@ ner for the Commission in this area of work , and so I am keen to follow in the fo@@ ot@@ steps of my pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or , Mr Patten , in pursu@@ ing a comprehensive and reg@@ ular dialogue with you on shared issues and concerns .
the purpose of today &apos;s decision is to safeguard the legal basis for the continued existence of the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights beyond the end of the year .
this nec@@ es@@ si@@ ta@@ tes what I hope will be Parliament &apos;s positive vote on the Commission &apos;s l@@ ong@@ standing proposal to extend Regulation ( EC ) No 9@@ 7@@ 6 / 1999 for a further two years .
there are just two weeks to go before the Regulation ex@@ pi@@ res , creating the risk that no funding will be available for projects and programmes under the European In@@ iti@@ ative in the coming year .
it will only be possible for the Council to adopt a positive decision before the Regulation ex@@ pi@@ res if the European Parliament votes in favour of the draft resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs today .
in my view , this is in everyone &apos;s en@@ li@@ gh@@ tened interest ; it is also in the political interests of the three institutions involved in the legislative process , and , above all , it is in the practical interests of those whom the projects supported by the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights are intended to benefit , namely civil soci@@ eties and citizens in numerous countries around the world .
the European In@@ iti@@ ative is a well @-@ functioning instrument : this is bor@@ ne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribu@@ te to the In@@ iti@@ ative and its valuable work .
it is wid@@ ely regar@@ ded as a successful instrument which provides direct support for civil society in many third countries where human rights viol@@ ations and , above all , a lack of democratic development are en@@ dem@@ ic .
the In@@ iti@@ ative supports numerous innova@@ tive and relevant projects , such as the abol@@ ition of the death penalty , tor@@ ture prevention and re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation of tor@@ ture victims , the advan@@ cement of the rights of women - an issue which is especially de@@ ar to me - as well as campa@@ ig@@ ning for the rights and interests of children , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and other mar@@ g@@ in@@ alised groups , and strengthening international law .
this foc@@ uses , for example , on the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al Court .
it also aims to fos@@ ter freedom of expression and promote democratic development through election obser@@ vation mis@@ sions .
I believe that the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights is a vi@@ br@@ ant expression of our shared values and , above all , the European Union &apos;s id@@ entity in the world .
I agree with the House , Mr President , that the In@@ iti@@ ative must be effective and well @-@ managed .
the Commission will therefore scru@@ tin@@ ise with attention and interest all the proposals put forward by this House which aim to achieve greater efficiency , the simp@@ li@@ fication of procedures and the effective use of resources .
to this end , let me give you my as@@ sur@@ an@@ ces that a mean@@ ing@@ ful , open and , above all , reg@@ ular dialogue will take place between Parliament and the Commission .
I believe that this dialogue will offer us the opportunity for joint discussion of the political and objective priorities of the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights .
after all , Parliament &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s priorities are largely id@@ en@@ tical ; they include , for example , the need to support the European Union &apos;s N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy via the In@@ iti@@ ative or to reinfor@@ ce democratic development in a number of countries .
it is therefore important , in my view - and this applies both to my own and the working level - for us to focus on the same priorities , examine the needs ar@@ ising in our N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy together , and set the best possible priorities on a joint basis .
as parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans , you have ac@@ qui@@ red particular exper@@ t@@ ise which I would like to draw on .
your support for the democracy movement in Ukraine or the forthcoming EU E@@ lec@@ tion O@@ b@@ ser@@ ver M@@ is@@ sion to Palestin@@ e , the W@@ est Bank and G@@ az@@ a are elo@@ qu@@ ent examples , and all I can say is that I believe we will work well together here .
let me conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by expres@@ sing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the mod@@ alities for this further dialogue as s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly as possible in order to develop genuinely fru@@ it@@ ful cooperation in this field in everyone &apos;s interest .
I look forward to our positive cooperation , and I gla@@ dly put my services at your dispos@@ al .
. Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for her opening remarks .
I am very pleased to see in the Chamber Mrs M@@ organ@@ tin@@ i , the chairman of the Committee on Development , Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre , the chairman of the Su@@ b@@ committee on Human Rights , the sha@@ dow rapporteur and my co @-@ rapporteur on the Committee on Development , Mr F@@ er@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z Mar@@ t@@ í@@ n .
there were two regulations , one of which has already been adopted by this House .
the one we are dealing with now is that cover@@ ing third countries .
t@@ wel@@ ve years ago I was rapporteur and , as Mr Patten has described me , &apos; fa@@ ther &apos; of the European initiative for democracy and human rights , which proved to be instru@@ mental in helping the trans@@ itional e@@ x @-@ So@@ vi@@ et blo@@ c countries .
it was considered by many as the European Union &apos;s fla@@ g@@ ship scheme for democracy promotion .
it gave mean@@ ing to the pre@@ am@@ ble to the Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t Treaty concerning the EU &apos;s foreign policy priorities .
in its initial phase it was ad@@ minis@@ tered by a small foun@@ d@@ ation based in Brussels , with both the European Parliament and the Commission playing an active role in the alloc@@ ation and super@@ vision of projects .
at its he@@ ight in 1997 , the initiative was financing and ad@@ minis@@ ter@@ ing around 1 200 projects .
in 1999 I visi@@ ted some of them in Bel@@ gra@@ de , including key pr@@ o @-@ democracy media , such as R@@ a@@ di@@ o B@@ 9@@ 2 .
the same year the initiative was taken in @-@ house by the Commission .
I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureauc@@ ratic and safe and that the European Parliament , as the only democra@@ tically elected institution , should once again play a greater role .
although the initiative currently has a budget of some EUR 13@@ 7 million , it la@@ cks visi@@ bility and effectiveness .
I am all the more convinced of this following meetings on the ground and discussions with more than 30 organisations .
most recently , I spoke to the Association of Belar@@ u@@ sian J@@ our@@ n@@ alists - currently here to receive the S@@ ak@@ har@@ o@@ v P@@ ri@@ z@@ e - as well as the E@@ ura@@ sia Direc@@ tor of a US pr@@ o @-@ democracy agency .
they were not even aware of the existence of the European democracy initiative .
this is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective .
an important point to make is that un@@ like rou@@ tin@@ e EU assistance , the European initiative does not require the h@@ ost government &apos;s con@@ sent .
in a country such as Belarus , not to speak of T@@ un@@ isia or Iran , in which operating through government ch@@ ann@@ els is difficult and often impossible , this cannot be under@@ estima@@ ted .
in a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003 , J@@ avi@@ er Solana out@@ lined the importance and sens@@ iti@@ vity of Europe &apos;s new neighbour@@ ho@@ od .
the resul@@ ting policy invi@@ tes our neighbours to the e@@ ast and s@@ outh to share in the peace , stability and prosperity that we enjo@@ y in the European Union .
it aims to create a &apos; ring of friends &apos; around the borders of the new enlarged European Union .
sa@@ dly , the only visi@@ bility of the EU &apos;s democracy activities in the new neighbour@@ ho@@ od seems to be short obser@@ vation mis@@ sions by Members of the European Parliament , such as those undertaken recently in Ukraine .
I believe that all significant elections in the new neighbour@@ ho@@ od should be the subject of full EU obser@@ vation mis@@ sions .
there is a feel@@ ing in Brussels that democracy cannot be ex@@ ported and that change must come from within .
however , the United States Na@@ tional En@@ do@@ w@@ ment for Democ@@ racy has shown since 198@@ 2 that the two can be comb@@ ined .
it oper@@ ates as an independent exper@@ t agency , using NGOs on the ground , and is much respected for its programmes and meth@@ od@@ ology .
as well as the United States activities , the W@@ es@@ t@@ min@@ s@@ ter F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation , for example , or the German and other NGOs have higher visi@@ bility and much less bureauc@@ racy than the European initiative .
I recently put together a document deta@@ il@@ ing the European Parliament &apos;s pr@@ o @-@ democracy activities , both within the EU and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
as Members , we participate in a my@@ ri@@ ad of inter@@ parliamentary dele@@ gations , consultation committees and infor@@ mal groups .
valuable work is being done , but the work is fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted .
