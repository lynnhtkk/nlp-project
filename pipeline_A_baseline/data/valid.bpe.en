the same can be said about the European initiative .
to my mind , our involvement should be coordin@@ ated in a democracy centre , based in this House , man@@ da@@ ted to act as a research uni@@ t , an over@@ si@@ ght body on all the EU &apos;s pr@@ o @-@ democracy activities .
to take an example , the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e of the State D@@ e@@ part@@ ment &apos;s B@@ ure@@ au for Democ@@ racy , Human Rights and L@@ ab@@ or bo@@ as@@ ts that the United States has over@@ seen the trans@@ ition of 8@@ 7 countries to democratic states .
is this a statis@@ tic that the EU wishes to leave in the hands of the United States alone ?
last wee@@ ken@@ d &apos;s G@@ 8 Conference in R@@ ab@@ at - and I am delighted that the Commissioner was present - co @-@ finan@@ ced by the European Union , further developed plans for the For@@ um for the F@@ u@@ ture , first introduced at the Se@@ a Is@@ land Summit in June 2004 , to promote democracy in the Middle East and North Africa .
despite the financial contribution of the European Union to such an important event , it is the Americ@@ ans rather than the European Union who are leading this activity .
we recognise that the United States programme essentially ec@@ ho@@ es the principles of the Barcelona process and now the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy .
in 2005 , the United Kingdom will take over the presidency of both the G@@ 8 and the European Union .
I sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that there will be a greater focus on the 2@@ 50 million Ara@@ bs who want democracy , as ill@@ ustra@@ ted by the 2002 United Nations Development Re@@ port , as well as the man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tly fail@@ ing countries to our e@@ ast .

Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human rights .
you will always be welcome .
Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t has gone over this Regulation , a regulation that clearly demonstra@@ tes all our vir@@ tu@@ es - our many vir@@ tu@@ es - and also many of our problems .
it is a mo@@ des@@ t regulation in terms of its budget , but very ambitious in terms of its objectives ; we all agree on the need to approve it but , nevertheless , we have spent a year and a half - perhaps much more - dealing with proc@@ ed@@ ural and bureauc@@ ratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue , which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation .
it has been a very complex process .
at the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this , by means of co @-@ decision , relating to third countries .
and now we are appro@@ ac@@ hing the entry into force of the necessary extension , which beg@@ ins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006 .
the Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valu@@ ed by Parliament .
what we have reite@@ ra@@ ted now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood .
Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding , as the Commissioner has pointed out , for peace mis@@ sions and mis@@ sions of elector@@ al obser@@ vers .
furthermore , it would like the Commission to present , on an annual basis or at inter@@ val@@ s it considers appropriate , an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project .
I sus@@ pect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co @-@ decision , with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report , has been modi@@ fied unila@@ ter@@ ally .
I hope that this will now be correc@@ ted , on the basis of the application of the Regulation , which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument , as this one is , for promoting democracy and human rights .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , promoting democracy and human rights in the world should be one of the priorities of the EU &apos;s external relations .
we feel em@@ pow@@ ered by our own , wid@@ ely @-@ held understanding of the concept of the human ra@@ ce and of every human being , and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a fre@@ er world , a world that can be fa@@ ire@@ r , a world capable of building justice in freedom and , consequently , a more peaceful and saf@@ er world .
by firmly commit@@ ting ourselves to the European initiative on democracy and human rights , we are promoting democracy , peace , the human ra@@ ce and security , all at the same time .
we must never lose si@@ ght of this , as we fine @-@ tun@@ e the instruments that we establish and as we ad@@ minis@@ ter the resources that we alloc@@ ate directly to this action area .
after a number of years &quot; experience , I should like to make some obser@@ vations .
firstly , Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field .
the amendments that have been proposed to the regulation will address this question suffici@@ ently , provided , of course , the Commission accep@@ ts them in the right spirit and makes a broad and exten@@ sive interpre@@ tation of the new guidelines , thereby taking relations with Parliament to a more open and closer level .
this is what we are calling for .
it is also necessary , however , to express our opinion on other issues that concern us more .
firstly , are we going to d@@ ilu@@ te these instruments into more and more areas , more lines and more them@@ es , or are we first going to set out a clear strategy , and then concentra@@ te on a guid@@ elin@@ e that dri@@ ves us forward and on fundamental priorities ?
I believe that the latter is the right way .
the concept of human rights is increasingly broad and also sometimes more va@@ gue .
there is also the te@@ mp@@ tation to use those instruments for anything and everything .
this to my mind would be the wrong way ; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of sc@@ ant resources , or to the du@@ pl@@ ication of instruments .
there are many other instruments for policies on cooperation and development with third countries , but these instruments of the European initiative for democracy and human rights are highly political and should be foc@@ used primarily on promoting democracy and that fundamental nu@@ cle@@ us of ci@@ vi@@ c and political rights , freedom of con@@ sci@@ ence and religi@@ on , freedom of expression and debate , the separ@@ ation of powers and the rule of law , freedom of organisation and activity of political parties and civil society , the opportunity to hold free and fair elections and the vi@@ tal@@ ity of open and plu@@ ral soci@@ eties .
to conclude , we must also ask ourselves if we are going to take the path of increasing bureauc@@ racy and offici@@ al@@ dom in car@@ rying out these policies , or will we be able to make those instruments more ag@@ ile ?
this , more than anything , is what I ask of the Commission ; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ ro@@ us , most d@@ aring and most inc@@ isi@@ ve lines of action .
bureauc@@ racy and offici@@ al@@ dom would lead to those instruments being totally un@@ used for one simple and in@@ tu@@ itive reason .
we cannot rely on dicta@@ tors to encourage and promote democracy in their countries .
we must therefore be more ag@@ ile and must know how to take our help to exactly where it is needed , exactly where it is la@@ cking and exactly where it will make a difference .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to welcome the Commissioner on behalf of our group .
let me come stra@@ ight to the point .
this evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years .
our group has no objec@@ tion in principle .
during the recent months of dialogue with the Commission , however , we have placed some political conditions on our ass@@ ent : that is to say , we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to com@@ mit to a struc@@ tu@@ red dialogue with Parliament .
it is not a question of our claim@@ ing management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliament &apos;s re@@ mit , but rather of claim@@ ing the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and , more generally , of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights .
we ask to be able to carry out an evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succ@@ eeded in advan@@ cing democracy in real terms .
in other words , Commissioner , this Parliament is asking to be involved in defin@@ ing the guidelines for our actions and in jud@@ ging the effectiveness of the results we obtain .
in recent years , many questions have remain@@ ed un@@ answ@@ ered and a great deal of information either has not arri@@ ved or has been sup@@ pli@@ ed in a highly sum@@ mar@@ ised form .
we do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme , which projects have been concluded , where they were carried out or with what concrete results - because in some countries the funds have been fro@@ z@@ en - or indeed what is being done to un@@ fre@@ e@@ z@@ e the funds .
we do not want to break the sa@@ c@@ red rules of com@@ it@@ ology , but it is a question of finding a for a relationship that is not just based on a ver@@ b@@ al expression of good will .
Commissioner , we appreciate your offer of coll@@ abor@@ ation , and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpre@@ ted as an act of trust .
it is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regar@@ ded , as it often is , as a no@@ tary who is called in to form@@ ally approve the accounts but who has to con@@ fine himself to that alone .
that is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions .
in this regard , we believe that this programme should be stre@@ am@@ lined and spe@@ ed@@ ed up as much as possible .
greater responsibilities should be given to local non @-@ governmental organisations on the ground , and more emphasis should be placed on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ projects and on certain campa@@ ig@@ ns that in the past have made some head@@ way in the difficult area of democracy in some countries .
we have to work a little har@@ der on democracy , as we have ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted it up to now while foc@@ using our operations on the area of human rights .
naturally , it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue , for which , Commissioner , Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote .
we hope , however , that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue - not just a form@@ ality but a dialogue of substance - to ass@@ ess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , perhaps we should start with the very ti@@ mely question posed quite rightly by Mr F@@ a@@ va regarding the dialogue between our institutions .
it is a rec@@ ur@@ ring them@@ e , which by the way makes this late sitting at this late se@@ as@@ on of the year wor@@ th@@ while .
on this subject , Commissioner , we have heard you say and we have read - and you also said in your hear@@ ing - that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can descri@@ be as they see f@@ it , but which I in any case understood to be reg@@ ular , relevant , open and pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ed , or , in short , struc@@ tu@@ red .
this proposal , the offer of dialogue , is clearly one that Parliament will ju@@ m@@ p at , because , as you know , the Members of this House are eag@@ er to have the opportunity to eng@@ age in in @-@ de@@ p@@ th discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about program@@ ming .
ladies and gentlemen , the b@@ all is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal em@@ an@@ ate from our ran@@ ks , from our committees and groups , in short from our Parliament , so that this dialogue can get under@@ way very quickly , because it is urg@@ ently needed , with a group of Members who are well @-@ mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted and have some exper@@ t@@ ise on this issue , and there is no shor@@ ta@@ ge of such people in this institution .
let us return to the initiative .
I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might under@@ take on democracy and human rights .
it has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our dispos@@ al to support , against the will of governments that are often au@@ to@@ c@@ ratic or dicta@@ tor@@ ial , civil society , acti@@ vis@@ ts and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely compl@@ icated .
it is the only instrument that enab@@ les us to act in this way , and it is extremely preci@@ ous .
in addition , I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perc@@ eiv@@ ed on the ground as being neu@@ tra@@ l , that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a b@@ id to domin@@ ate or take over and is not perc@@ eiv@@ ed as doing so , contrary to the claim@@ s made when American agencies work on the ground , with such claim@@ s very often heard in M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b , in any case .
it is a very preci@@ ous ass@@ et , made possible by the quality of the European Union &apos;s intervention .
of course there is still room for improvement .
one of the issues , and we all know of many examples , is that some NGOs cannot , for one reason or another , be supported under this initiative .
the governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic mo@@ v@@ ements develop in their mid@@ st are not la@@ cking in resources or imag@@ ination .
we have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply bann@@ ed from receiv@@ ing the grant by a political dec@@ re@@ e or by direct c@@ ensure .
all of the decisions have been taken , but these NGOs are preven@@ ted from benef@@ iting from the funds granted to them .
we have other examples of associ@@ ations which quite simply do not leg@@ ally exist .
in such cases we have to res@@ or@@ t to sub@@ ter@@ fu@@ ge , and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ing@@ en@@ ious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals .
I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007 .
and there , as other Members have rightly done , I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this preci@@ ous ass@@ et , that we can always improve , is able to end@@ ure beyond 2006 .
that is what is at sta@@ ke in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to welcome the Commissioner and I particularly appreciate the fact that she is a w@@ oman .
I fully agree with the need to extend the implementing arrangements relating to human rights , development and democracy .
I congratulate Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t and I especially share the opinion of Mr F@@ er@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z Mar@@ t@@ í@@ n - in line with the vote I c@@ ast in committee - particularly on the amendment specifically calling on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the program@@ ming and to report back to Parliament on the implementation .
I have , however , in the words of Mrs F@@ er@@ r@@ ero @-@ W@@ al@@ d@@ ner , se@@ iz@@ ed upon the Commission &apos;s willingness to coll@@ abor@@ ate and also to hold a serious and in @-@ de@@ p@@ th dialogue not only on the general guidelines but also on project execu@@ tion .
I truly hope , amongst other things , that this dialogue will also take place directly with the Committee on Development , which I cha@@ ir , since the issues of human rights , the em@@ power@@ ment of women and democracy are in fact closely linked to the question of development .
I should like to say to my very l@@ ike@@ able fellow Member Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t that I understand his f@@ r@@ ustra@@ tion and I agree about this preci@@ ous project , as Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre put it .
in fact , par@@ ents cannot always bear to see their children gro@@ w up .
quite fran@@ kly , I would not want to em@@ ula@@ te the United States , because their actions have very often led to the rise of dicta@@ tor@@ ships - I am thinking of the P@@ ino@@ ch@@ et regime , for example .
I believe the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East has already been re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated by many in the Middle East because it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help .
I should therefore like us to re@@ tain our own individual charac@@ ter and also to value the important work that we are doing .
we do not actually want to export democracy , but we want democracy to gro@@ w and to have the ability to gro@@ w , and we can provide the to@@ ols for that purpose .
through vis@@ iting conflict z@@ ones and seeing the huge number of projects , I have realis@@ ed that the ability to act without going through the authorities is fundamenta@@ lly important .
the questions of tor@@ ture , training and recovery , as well as the question of the em@@ power@@ ment of women have been extremely important .
I think we really need to continue along this path , but obviously in the knowledge that there are many lim@@ ita@@ tions and many short@@ com@@ ings , including in the area of finance .
I should not like us to con@@ fine ourselves to election obser@@ vation mis@@ sions , which very often cannot actually be taken very seriously if you consider that they only last one day .
I should really like us to continue operating along lines where@@ by our aid and our actions can truly be a too@@ l for helping democracy to gro@@ w and not for im@@ pos@@ ing our values .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to say that Mrs F@@ er@@ r@@ ero @-@ W@@ al@@ d@@ ner is the right person in the right place .
this cannot be said of all her colleagues , but that is no fa@@ ult of h@@ ers .
the European Parliament &apos;s role is becoming ever more important within the EU institutions , and its authority is becoming ever greater amongst the public in the Member States .
after 25 years as a directly @-@ elected body , Parliament &apos;s importance is now at its he@@ ight .
yet we should not der@@ i@@ ve satisfac@@ tion from the strengthening of Parliament &apos;s role as a result of b@@ att@@ les of competence or procedure within the European Union .
to a greater extent than pre@@ viously , the European Parliament &apos;s role must be to promote democracy in the world and to provide information on values and standards .
these values and standards ensure that , although our soci@@ eties and political systems are not ide@@ al , there are fe@@ wer w@@ ars and more dialogue on our continent , less violence and more compromise , and less institutional ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion and more international and institutional cooperation .
this is not a matter of promoting European values .
it is a matter of infor@@ ming people about a sty@@ le of politics based on a se@@ ar@@ ch for the common good and on wid@@ ening participation in government at every level .
this is the role of both the European Union and the European Parliament today .
is EUR 100 million too much to spen@@ d on promoting democracy in the world ?
it is un@@ doub@@ tedly not enough , yet even a su@@ m five times greater would still be much che@@ aper than going to the expen@@ se of re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing the effects of a lack of democracy .
it would cost a great deal more to provide assistance to the victims of civil and international w@@ ars that break out because politicians in many countries do not understand the mean@@ ing of democracy .
they only know it as a no@@ tion found in foreign language ph@@ r@@ ase bo@@ o@@ ks .
if more than EUR 100 million were to be granted , it would of course be necessary to monitor both our own institutions and the organisations receiv@@ ing the funding .
in conclusion , I should like to offer my sinc@@ ere thanks to Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t , the rapporteur , for his work .
I hope the House will continue to work together on this issue , regar@@ d@@ less of political div@@ isions , and that it will work towards the goals referred to by Mrs F@@ er@@ r@@ ero @-@ W@@ al@@ d@@ ner and the rapporteur .
Mr President , I join with others in wel@@ coming the new Commissioner to this debate .
we look forward to working with her and , indeed , we look forward to the Commission &apos;s plans in 2005 and 2006 on this budget line , the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomorrow .
I support the fact that this is a budget line that reac@@ hes the gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots and that civil society in the countries has a priority in receiv@@ ing the mon@@ ies .
I also support the fact that the Commission is planning to make conflict prevention a permanent priority for this budget line .
surely democracy is the best instrument of conflict prevention in our world .
I support what the Commission has done in terms of improving the contac@@ ts and support from its own dele@@ gations in third countries for projects under these lines , and also their plans to extend funding for m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ projects , in particular for local NGOs in third countries who are most valu@@ ed by us in this Parliament .
if I have a word of criticism , it is that every year the Commissioner &apos;s pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or used to speak about human rights and then come in with a pre@@ l@@ imin@@ ary draft budget that cut this line - last year from EUR 12@@ 7 million to EUR 10@@ 5 million .
perhaps the Commissioner will choose not to do that in forthcoming years .
indeed , as Mrs F@@ lau@@ tre has said , I hope that , whilst there are proper objectives for simp@@ li@@ fication of the budget , this particular line has symb@@ ol@@ ic importance and will be maintained in the medium and long term .
I also draw to her attention the increasing demands from international organisations , like the ad ho@@ c tri@@ b@@ un@@ als for Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via and R@@ wan@@ da and the International C@@ r@@ imin@@ al Court .
however , if these are to be fun@@ ded from this budget line there must be a significant increase or NGOs will fail .
I op@@ pose the attempt to reduce the priority given to projects wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide under this budget line and ref@@ oc@@ us on ne@@ ar Europe .
that is a mis@@ take : human rights are univers@@ al in our world .
finally , I express my respect for the rapporteur , Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t , and his sinc@@ ere interest in this budget line ; but I am pleased that he with@@ dre@@ w his amendments , which I believe represented m@@ ic@@ ro @-@ management of this budget line .
the Commission &apos;s commitment to struc@@ tu@@ red dialogue , as it put it , is one that we should welcome , and , with my colleagues on Parliament &apos;s Su@@ b@@ committee on Human Rights , I very much look forward to eng@@ ag@@ ing with the new Commissioner on that .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for this debate .
firstly , let me say to the V@@ ice @-@ President , Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t , that if he had not already in@@ ven@@ ted this interesting procedure , we would have to inv@@ ent it now .
I am absolutely convinced that it is a good thing , for I have always been highly committed to human rights .
in other words , you can coun@@ t on the fact that you are dealing with some@@ one who really believes in what they are doing .
let me say again that there will be genuine dialogue , not only at my level but also at working level .
I would like to reiterate this point une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally .
I do not agree that all we have done is obser@@ ve elections .
I can c@@ ite a h@@ ost of examples demonstra@@ ting that this is not the case .
we need only think of Ukraine , where a vari@@ ety of projects is under way .
let me c@@ ite a few examples to show you that we really cannot view the situation in such n@@ ar@@ row terms .
the Commission is already providing support here : for example , it has given EUR 3@@ 00 000 to the European C@@ en@@ tre for Common G@@ ro@@ und , EUR 3@@ 34 000 to the International Hel@@ sin@@ ki F@@ eder@@ ation for Human Rights : improving the Human Rights S@@ itu@@ ation in Ukraine through Legal A@@ id Pro@@ v@@ id@@ ed by NGOs , EUR 7@@ 8@@ 7 000 to the European Rom@@ a Rights C@@ enter : def@@ ending the rights of Rom@@ a in Ukraine , EUR 6@@ 8@@ 5 000 to the K@@ har@@ ki@@ v Human Rights Pro@@ te@@ ction Group , and so on .
these are just a few of the projects .
let me turn to another region of the world which is very important to you and , indeed , to me , namely the S@@ ou@@ thern Mediterranean , the Ara@@ b region , although this does not only include the Ara@@ b countries , it also includes Israel , of course .
one example is the project entitled Palestin@@ e : Democ@@ rati@@ z@@ ation from the G@@ r@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots , Me@@ dia and N@@ et@@ working as a T@@ o@@ ol for Community Development , which is important in that it foc@@ uses primarily on civil society .
let me reiterate : I am particularly pleased - and I think this is a for@@ tun@@ ate co@@ inc@@ idence - that I was able to present se@@ ven action plans recently to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Mon@@ day .
the Commission and the Council have adopted the proposals and everyone spoke about them in very positive terms .
why ?
because these action plans will enable us to bring our values , namely human rights and everything with which they are associated - namely the rule of law , human rights and democracy - to these countries , such as Ukraine , as soon as free and fair elections have taken place there .
after that , the implementation beg@@ ins .
however , they also focus on a poor yet important country like the Republic of M@@ ol@@ do@@ va , where we also need to take action .
Belarus is a separate case which I will come back to in a moment .
then , of course , there are the major countries in the Middle East which are ready for this process , no@@ tably J@@ ord@@ an , Moro@@ cc@@ o , T@@ un@@ isia , Palestin@@ e and Israel .
the pres@@ entation of these se@@ ven action plans at this time off@@ ers a really good opportunity , in my view , to work together with and on these countries .
naturally , the action plans also offer opportunities for us to present our priorities al@@ ong@@ side the countries &apos; own priorities and promote democracy and human rights .
I would like to out@@ line some of the campa@@ ig@@ ns which we are car@@ rying out within our human rights programme .
I ad@@ mit that they do not amount to a mas@@ sive su@@ m , but it is still considerable , and I believe that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail .
campaign 1 is entitled &apos; Pro@@ motion , justice and dignity &apos; .
this targets criminal justice , supports univers@@ al abol@@ ition of the death penalty , and supports the work of international mechanisms which monitor and report on respect for human rights and related international treaty obligations .
campaign 2 , which is especially de@@ ar to me , is entitled &apos; F@@ os@@ tering a culture of human rights &apos; : human rights education , training , monitoring and awareness @-@ ra@@ ising by tar@@ g@@ et@@ ing advan@@ cement of rights of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alised or v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able groups - that means the rights of women and children - including f@@ em@@ ale gen@@ ital mu@@ tila@@ tion , trafficking of women , human rights def@@ end@@ ers ; tor@@ ture prevention and re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation of tor@@ ture victims , programmes of higher education and training for profession@@ als , support for human rights di@@ alo@@ gu@@ es .
so , on the whole , it is a very important campaign .
campaign 3 is entitled &apos; Pro@@ mo@@ ting democratic process &apos; .
this is essential for all these soci@@ eties , especially for the Middle East or the broad@@ er Middle East , which I will come to later .
so there is a lot of development of particip@@ atory democracy , fos@@ tering informed pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic dis@@ course with civil society , tar@@ g@@ et@@ ing freedom of association , freedom of expression , independent press , broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting , un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded access to the Internet , and election obser@@ vation mis@@ sions .
campaign 4 is entitled &apos; A@@ d@@ van@@ cing equality , toler@@ ance and peace &apos; , emb@@ ra@@ ces the issues of ra@@ cial discrimination , x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia , rights of minorities , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous peoples .
then there is the sel@@ ec@@ tion of regions and countries and mat@@ ching them with each of the four campa@@ ig@@ ns .
all that is for@@ eseen for 2007 , and in the next financial perspective there will be only six finance regulations , four of which are very important ones : enlargement , development , good neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy and stability .
in all of them , democracy and human rights are in the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am , which is a real achiev@@ ement on the basis of which we can work .
there is them@@ atic program@@ ming here .
re@@ turning to Belarus , which we spoke about in the Council recently , I expla@@ ined that I wanted to work specifically with the NGOs .
we then received an invi@@ tation from Li@@ thu@@ ania to hold a wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p there .
so we will have three p@@ has@@ es : firstly , two p@@ has@@ es in the Commission , and then we will conf@@ er with Parliament .
then there is also an invi@@ tation from Li@@ thu@@ ania , because Li@@ thu@@ ania , Pol@@ and and many of these countries know where we have to start with NGOs .
you are right : we can only work with civil society there , because we cannot work with governments at this stage .
on the broad@@ er Middle East , I was very interested in this new possibility for cooperation .
it is true that we have been working for ten years with the countries of the Middle East , the sou@@ thern b@@ as@@ in of the Mediterranean .
the United States is now doing something similar .
it is a good initiative , because the more we can work in par@@ all@@ el and thus bring more democracy and easier access to democracy to the region , the better .
I now turn to some other more for@@ mal questions .
according to the information I have , for reasons of jur@@ id@@ ical coher@@ ence , the Council has now re@@ introduced the amendments tabled by Parliament when Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions ( EC ) Nos 9@@ 75 / 1999 and 9@@ 7@@ 6 / 1999 were at the draf@@ ting stage .
I hope this information is welcome to the Members who raised this .
in order to work better with NGOs it was essential to have dec@@ on@@ c@@ en@@ tra@@ tion , as we call it .
that means that we have given a lot of responsibility to the dele@@ gations , that are also in a much better position to conduct a sur@@ ve@@ y on what NGOs are doing .
this is also why we will follow developments much better .
I hope that there will be better control because I know that while , on the one hand , we should have a spe@@ edy means of action , on the other hand we also have to be very careful and to control things properly .
this is what I wanted to say .
indeed , it is an offer of dialogue on my part .
I thank you for taking it .
we are not perfec@@ t , but there is a positive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this positive spirit to work together for the major values of our European Union - that is , human rights .
. Mr President , as the Commissioner will find , the European Parliament always has the last word .
I am pleased that the Commission is beginning to examine the possibility of doing some work in Belarus .
I mentioned Belarus , and also T@@ un@@ isia and Iran : two other countries where nothing is happening .
I am grateful for the good will and the commitment of the Commissioner in her new post , and we welcome her into it .
I also welcome her commitment to establish some working @-@ level cooperation between Parliament and the Commission .
I advis@@ e the Commission that this week the European Parliament , through the good offic@@ es of the Human Rights Su@@ b@@ committee , is com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing a study by independent experts into the operation of this programme .
it is something I asked for last year from the Commission , but it was un@@ willing to give it .
this will be comple@@ ted by February .
may I make one final re@@ mark , since I know the Commissioner was in R@@ ab@@ at at the wee@@ ken@@ d and we are dealing with a vas@@ t and important agenda : the process of reform in the Middle East .
when I beg@@ an working on this report , the funds available from the European In@@ iti@@ ative on Democ@@ racy and Human Rights to the entire Middle East were four per cent of the total .
given the circumstances of the last three years , that was an extra@@ ordin@@ arily low fig@@ ure .
I am pleased the Commission is now adjus@@ ting that , and we need to ref@@ oc@@ us the programme .
no@@ t@@ with@@ standing what Mr H@@ o@@ wit@@ t said , we have strategic objectives and strategic priorities .
I am pleased to see the Commission is now beginning to focus on those .
I thank the Commissioner for her words and for her commitment , and we look forward to working together construc@@ tively and practic@@ ally , but on the basis of equal interest in the development of democracy , particularly in our neighbour@@ ho@@ od .

the next item is the debate on the report by Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is on the proposal for a Council decision amen@@ ding Dec@@ ision 1999 / 8@@ 4@@ 7 / EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
. Mr President , I am pleased that Parliament supports the Commission &apos;s proposal for the extension of the Community action programme on civil protection for the years 2005 and 2006 .
I very much appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report , in particular the work of Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is , the rapporteur .
before I go into detail on this report , I think it is worth rec@@ all@@ ing the work done under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of this action plan since its adoption in December 1999 .
the objectives of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensure better protection for people , the environment and proper@@ ty in the event of natural or technolog@@ ical disas@@ ters across the Community .
the action programme has fun@@ ded a range of useful projects , ex@@ changes of experts and wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s that build in@@ valuable cooperation and also mutual assistance between the Member States &apos; civil protection services .
the action programme supports and suppl@@ ements efforts at national , regional and local levels .
emphasis has been put on major projects concerning prevention , information of the public , crisis management , disaster medic@@ ine and net@@ working among the different volun@@ te@@ er associ@@ ations active on the ground .
in recent years we have seen major disas@@ ters .
you will rec@@ all the f@@ loo@@ ds in central and eas@@ tern Europe in the sum@@ mer of 2002 , the oil sp@@ ill , also in the same year , the un@@ preced@@ ented he@@ at@@ wa@@ ve and de@@ vasta@@ ting for@@ est fi@@ res in sou@@ thern Europe in the sum@@ mer of 2003 .
this year we were sho@@ c@@ ked by the viol@@ ent terrorist attack in Mad@@ rid and sa@@ d@@ den@@ ed by the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es in Iran and Moro@@ cc@@ o .
these events clearly ill@@ ustra@@ ted the need for further action to strengthen prevention and prepar@@ ed@@ ness measures and also to enhan@@ ce our ability to respond ra@@ pid@@ ly and in solidarity as a European Union .
the Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection .
the rapporteur has rightly highli@@ ghted some issues in the report , and these are both valuable and constructive remarks that we will take into account in our future work .
I would like to re@@ act immediately to a number of points .
the report recommen@@ ds &apos; better shar@@ ing of information on available resources , exper@@ t@@ ise and successful strateg@@ ies and practices at national level &apos; .
the Commission agre@@ es that our da@@ tab@@ ase of resources should be further up@@ gra@@ ded and contain more data on respon@@ sive capac@@ ities , associated costs and available equipment .
the Commission is currently working with Member States on these issues .
the report argu@@ es for an improved operational framework for volun@@ te@@ ers and for the establishment of guidelines for their work .
this is a help@@ ful sugges@@ tion and ec@@ ho@@ es the emphasis that the Commission is now putting on the work on this subject , which was and will remain a priority for financing in 2005 .
let me turn to the issue of financing assistance during emer@@ gen@@ cies .
this is an issue of concern to us , but depen@@ ds on having a sufficient level of funding available .
for the time being the budgetary resources available only per@@ mit financing of experts who travel to the sc@@ ene of disas@@ ters to ass@@ ess needs for assistance .
additional financing depen@@ ds at present on the don@@ ating and receiv@@ ing Member States .
I should like to add that there is also , as you know , the possibility to use the EU Sol@@ id@@ arity Fund to provide compensation to a country suffering sever@@ e damage from a disaster .
finally , the report as@@ ks the Commission to provide a report on the programme in 2006 .
we have no difficul@@ ty in accep@@ ting this request .
with these remarks , I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful and constructive opinion .
may I add that my colleague , Commissioner D@@ im@@ as , sen@@ ds his a@@ pol@@ og@@ ies for not being here .
he is in Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ i@@ res and asked me to re@@ place him .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on this report comes , as the Commissioner noted , after a series of major natural disas@@ ters in recent years which raise the question of the need to strengthen the Community action programme : f@@ loo@@ ds , he@@ at @-@ wa@@ ves , for@@ est fi@@ res , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , serious pollution inc@@ idents from to@@ x@@ ic waste or oil spi@@ lls , such as that from the , as well as serious industrial accidents and also terrorist attacks .
my country , Greece , is currently experienc@@ ing im@@ men@@ se an@@ xi@@ ety as the result of the hi@@ j@@ ac@@ king of a b@@ us with several h@@ osta@@ ges whose lives are in danger .
these dang@@ ers and these disas@@ ters have many victims and cause ever greater economic los@@ ses ; they dis@@ rup@@ t the econom@@ ies of the countries affected , h@@ it@@ ting in particular the poor@@ est and most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able sec@@ tions of the population .
that is precisely why action also needs to be taken by governments , preven@@ tive measures need to be strength@@ ened and response capac@@ ities need to be extended .
the Community response to this problem is the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
this programme ex@@ pi@@ res in a few days , on 31 December 2004 , and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared , in order to avoid a ga@@ p until such time as the new programme is prepared .
that is why I support the Commission proposal to pro@@ long this programme for the next two years , just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.@@ 5 million ann@@ u@@ ally , which was the amount in 2004 , to EUR 2@@ .@@ 4 million ann@@ u@@ ally for the next two years .
you may say it is not a big increase .
I agree , but it is absolutely essential in order to finance increased needs due to enlargement and to finance the action programme to combat mar@@ ine pollution which has been decided in the mean@@ time .
unfortunately , it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perc@@ ep@@ tion as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission , and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation .
otherwise , we shall not be consistent in our obligations towards the citizens and it is precisely at times of natural disas@@ ters that those who voted for us and sent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by their side .
this programme therefore needs to proceed and , at the same time , certain points in it need to be improved on the basis of experience ob@@ tained to date .
in stud@@ ying the problem , I have identi@@ fied se@@ ven sectors in which improvements are needed in practice , because on paper the system loo@@ ks good , but on the ground experience to date has shown that it has serious short@@ com@@ ings .
one , better shar@@ ing of information on available resources , exper@@ t@@ ise and successful strateg@@ ies at national level .
the da@@ tab@@ ase , its data and the capacity for f@@ ast communication and coordination need to be improved , in other words the com@@ pu@@ ter da@@ tab@@ ase needs to be up@@ gra@@ ded .
two , more training for intervention te@@ am@@ s .
experience has shown that more reg@@ ular training is needed for better cooperation and inte@@ ro@@ per@@ ability .
three , better communication , coordination , in @-@ time information systems for the pro@@ mp@@ t information of the public and lin@@ ks with other networks .
four , funding : not simply increasing funding but safe@@ guar@@ ding spe@@ e@@ di@@ er response with the rele@@ ase of the source of funding and concentra@@ ting all the appropriations needed under one head@@ ing .
five , strengthening social partnership with a more active involvement of civil society and local authorities .
increasing the number of volun@@ te@@ ers .
six , em@@ power@@ ment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disas@@ ters .
and se@@ ven , implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and reinfor@@ cement of the drawing up of national plans for emergency coordination , a sector in which numerous Member States have serious short@@ com@@ ings .
for the reasons which I have described to you and so as not to be too l@@ ong@@ w@@ in@@ ded , because it is already quite late , I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the greatest possible support , as did the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety , which approved my report almost unanim@@ ously .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is &apos;s report regarding the absolu@@ te necess@@ ity of exten@@ ding the Community action programme for the two @-@ year period of 2005 @-@ 2006 in order to facilitate cooperation , especially cross @-@ border cooperation , on the exchange of exper@@ t@@ ise and mutual assistance among Member States in this field .
cross @-@ border cooperation and a cooperation culture are fundamental , because the security of the countries in the European Union is closely linked to what happens on their borders .
to that end , we must inv@@ est he@@ a@@ vil@@ y in volun@@ te@@ ers .
in addition , we agree on the se@@ ven areas that need to be strength@@ ened , in view of the defic@@ i@@ encies re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed at the level of individual nations .
the European People &apos;s Party also believes that the Commission ought to evalu@@ ate the implementation of the current programme before it ends and prepare a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council .
I would point out that the Community action programme is being extended to the years 2005 @-@ 2006 without Parliament having been sent the mid @-@ term report or the final report provided for by Dec@@ ision 1999 / 8@@ 4@@ 7 / EC establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 .
to date we have not even received any justi@@ fication for the delay .
that is a very serious fail@@ ing , because it viol@@ ates Parliament &apos;s pr@@ er@@ og@@ ative to give its opinion and forces it come to a decision without seeing any qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive or qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive information on the actions taken or the results achieved .
our confidence in the new Commission , however , lead@@ s us to hope that these reports will be for@@ war@@ ded by the requested date of 30 June 2006 , precisely for the purpose - and in the hope - of promoting full cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission .
those documents should give us an evaluation of the extent of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection , together with the actions planned under the other two ongoing Community programmes , which will provide Parliament &apos;s Committee on the Environment with useful sugges@@ tions for inclu@@ sion in the single action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , happ@@ ily we all agree on this issue and , consequently , I also share what has been said by previous speakers .
we feel that it is crucial to extend this action programme and we also de@@ e@@ m it important that in the two years concerned , 2005 and 2006 , the Commission can make an acc@@ ura@@ te assessment of the current programme and can prepare a new and more ambitious instrument of action , taking account of the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 and any needs identi@@ fied in the mean@@ time .
new problems require new solutions .
we also , therefore , endorse Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is &apos;s report - and I compl@@ im@@ ent him on his work - and we naturally support the Commission &apos;s proposal to extend the programme .
we do feel , however , that , be@@ aring in mind the programme &apos;s objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries , funding should be ste@@ pped up even further .
the importance of civil protection continues to gro@@ w .
persons and proper@@ ty must be protected and this is an area that requires greater resources .
in recent years , as has been pointed out in this House , a number of natural disas@@ ters and crimin@@ ally @-@ mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted disas@@ ters have oc@@ cur@@ red , which have affected both the people and the econom@@ ies of the countries concerned .
such was the case of the accident , the f@@ loo@@ ds in the South of France , the terrorist attack on Mad@@ rid and the for@@ est fi@@ res in Spain and Portugal .
coming from Portugal as I do , I am particularly sensitive to this issue , as you will understand .
as I have said , greater funding would be des@@ ira@@ ble so that we can better prevent and re@@ me@@ dy situations of this nature .
in Portugal alone , for example , in 2003 , 4@@ 00@@ .000 h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res of for@@ est were bur@@ n@@ t and appro@@ xim@@ ately 17@@ 0@@ .000 h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res in 2004 .
it is therefore essential that the next action instrument provides for greater financial support .
the environment is pr@@ ic@@ eless and our fores@@ ts cannot continue to dis@@ appear .
we have an obligation to preser@@ ve them so that we can leave them to future gener@@ ations .
we cannot forget that the E@@ ar@@ th does not bel@@ ong to us , it has been bor@@ ro@@ wed for our children .
we must therefore step up measures aimed at prevention and c@@ ure .
as far as prevention is concerned , there must be greater EU involvement , in con@@ jun@@ ction with national , regional and local administra@@ tions , along with technical and financial support , to prevent these disas@@ ters , which occ@@ ur year after year .
prevention is better , and indeed more effective and che@@ aper , than c@@ ure .
with regard to restor@@ ative measures , coordination and monitoring must be ste@@ pped up , particularly in terms of re@@ fores@@ ting the areas affected by the fi@@ res .
it is worth re@@ memb@@ ering that the restor@@ ation of the Mediterranean for@@ est has taken almost a hun@@ d@@ red years .
there are sectors in which we cannot make sa@@ v@@ ings .
as for civil protection , making sa@@ v@@ ings might mean becoming ir@@ re@@ de@@ em@@ ably po@@ ore@@ r and our collective future being sever@@ ely compromis@@ ed .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall say stra@@ ight away that I am in favour of exten@@ ding the Community action programme on civil protection by two years .
to me it seems not so much a free choice as a man@@ d@@ atory solution , without any alterna@@ tives .
we have reached the end of the current programme without a las@@ ting , concrete solution to the problem .
that very fact shows just how mar@@ g@@ inal the subject of civil protection in Europe is .
I feel I have developed some mo@@ des@@ t experience in this field , as I cha@@ ir the civil protection committee in Ca@@ ta@@ nia , the prov@@ in@@ ce of Italy most ex@@ posed to se@@ is@@ mic and vol@@ can@@ ic risk , and also because I coordin@@ ated the emergency measures for the Italian Government during the terri@@ ble er@@ up@@ tion of M@@ oun@@ t E@@ t@@ n@@ a in the sum@@ mer of 2001 .
over the years I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agre@@ e@@ able to@@ pic for a round table or a ple@@ as@@ ant , con@@ vi@@ vi@@ al get @-@ together , but is a subject that is in@@ dis@@ s@@ olu@@ bly linked to people &apos;s safety and , as you know , safety is a p@@ hy@@ si@@ ological right before it is a constitutional right .
I believe I can say that the European Union is seriously and s@@ cand@@ al@@ ously dra@@ gg@@ ing its fe@@ et in this area .
the subject was first addressed only five years ago with a number of initiatives that appear good in the@@ ory but in practice su@@ ffer from serious defic@@ i@@ encies - as was pointed out by the rapporteur himself , whose work I ad@@ mi@@ re .
in fact , the approach seems sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ic not only at a log@@ is@@ tical level but also because of the ina@@ dequate financial cover .
Commissioner , what results have the information monitoring centre , the solidarity fund and the Community mechanism achieved in terms of risk fo@@ rec@@ as@@ ting and prevention , rather than of emergency and post @-@ emergency management ?
what qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tive results have they had on European Union territory ?
can we find out what their effect has been ?
can we have a detailed report ?
will people understand that a disaster may not always co@@ inc@@ ide with the borders of an individual state , thus becoming a sup@@ ran@@ ational problem , as the oil s@@ lic@@ k from the demonstrated ?
how can civil protection capa@@ bilities in Europe be allowed to remain fra@@ g@@ men@@ ted among the areas of responsibility of the environment , health , territory , agriculture and internal affairs ?
a European civil protection agency needs to be set up , something I asked the Commission to do two years ago .
apart from the fact that an operational structure can un@@ doub@@ tedly increase involvement , especially in Member States that are less sensitive to the problem , such a solution would have the advantage of operating above the territor@@ ial level to develop and harmon@@ ise procedures and methods for analys@@ ing and m@@ iti@@ g@@ ating the risk of natural and technolog@@ ical disas@@ ters , and it would establish a proper task force .
in conclusion , I believe we need to promote the action of civil protection volun@@ te@@ ers and to support it with struc@@ tu@@ red training , equipment and funds , so that it can become an essential res@@ ource for dealing with emer@@ gen@@ cies and natural and other disas@@ ters .
I hope that the Commission will find the streng@@ th , the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his clear and specific comments on the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
his proposals on integrated management and more efficient operation of the relevant mechanism and the extension of the programme , which we support , are also to the point .
over recent years , all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienc@@ ed disas@@ ters with the broad@@ est , direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole .
in response to these events , we adopted the Community action programme .
as we all rec@@ all , we were over@@ taken by events and reac@@ ted after them .
let us take proper sto@@ ck today , qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tively and qu@@ al@@ ita@@ tively , and let us look with the experience we have ac@@ qui@@ red at how we can improve the existing mechanism in all its func@@ tions and at all sta@@ ges , from prevention to combating of disas@@ ters and the restor@@ ation of and return to social life .
this relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Sol@@ id@@ arity Fund .
the rapporteur proposes better exchange of information and best practices , more training for intervention te@@ am@@ s , mo@@ bil@@ ising volun@@ te@@ ers and better coordination between the agencies involved at European , national , regional and local level .
as far as increasing the budget is concerned , it is necessary but , at the same time , the procedure also needs to be simp@@ li@@ fied .
I trust that the issue we are deb@@ ating ton@@ ight will receive the ass@@ ent of the Council , because it is a very important issue .
it not only resol@@ ves daily problems , but is also of major symb@@ ol@@ ic importance .
the citizens feel the European Union in their lives with this sort of intervention .
European nation@@ ality thus ac@@ qui@@ res a specific and deep@@ er mean@@ ing .
this sort of programme brings European institutions , national and local agencies and local authorities into direct cooperation , something in which we are la@@ gg@@ ing behind , both at national level and in terms of coordination between the European Union and the national agencies .
to the outside world , this sort of programme gives the European Union visi@@ bility and , more importan@@ tly , projects an efficient and human@@ e face , something which , lis@@ tening to you on the previous report Commissioner , you intend to make a reality .
Mr President , I wish first of all to welcome the proposal by the rapporteur , Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is , to extend the action programme in the field of civil protection .
coming from a country which has bene@@ fi@@ ted in the past from EU funding in order to c@@ ope with natural disas@@ ters , I fully appreciate the importance of the programme .
indeed , as a former minis@@ ter in my own government , I visi@@ ted Brussels in 1995 seeking assistance to alle@@ vi@@ ate the effects of substantial f@@ loo@@ ding throughout the l@@ eng@@ th and b@@ read@@ th of Ireland .
I succ@@ eeded in ob@@ tain@@ ing considerable financial assistance .
I note the increase in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 2005 and 2006 but , like other speakers who have contribu@@ ted to this debate , when I examine the increase I note that it is a m@@ ere EUR 0@@ .@@ 9 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006 .
I read the report in some detail and the justi@@ fication for the increase is &apos; EU enlargement &apos; .
when one considers the fact that we are increasing the siz@@ e of our Community and wel@@ coming the accession of 10 new Member States to our Community , in real terms the so @-@ called increase is actually a dec@@ reas@@ e ; that is without fac@@ tor@@ ing in inf@@ lation .
I would like to see an emergency fund - I know you mentioned the Sol@@ id@@ arity Fund - for civil disas@@ ters , where direct aid would be given to the regions of the new accession states , in the same way as Ireland was help@@ ed in the past .
these states have fre@@ ed themselves from the ir@@ on g@@ ri@@ p of M@@ os@@ co@@ w .
they all quali@@ fy for O@@ b@@ jec@@ tive 1 status ; their econom@@ ies are still largely emb@@ ry@@ on@@ ic .
just as Ireland found itself in civil disas@@ ters , these new countries will ine@@ vi@@ tably find themselves in situations where natural disas@@ ters will occ@@ ur .
I fundamenta@@ lly believe that we should set asi@@ de each year a substantial fund to assis@@ t such countries by way of direct reli@@ ef aid .
I commen@@ d the rapporteur for his syste@@ matic approach and recommendations .
he w@@ ent through each area in detail .
prevention , where possible , is des@@ ira@@ ble ; prepar@@ ed@@ ness is vital ; protection , emergency measures and recovery are all essential .
I believe the scheme that he has prepared is excellent , but it is totally under@@ fun@@ ded .
we cannot fores@@ ee ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , f@@ loo@@ ds or for@@ est fi@@ res - they are natural disas@@ ters .
in conclusion ,
I am not speaking S@@ wa@@ hil@@ i , it is my own na@@ tive ton@@ gue , Irish , which unfortunately is the only official language not included in the Community .
a happy Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas and a happy New Y@@ e@@ ar to each and every one of you .
. Mr President , I have lis@@ tened very carefully to what has been said .
first I wish to thank you all - the rapporteur and all the Members of Parliament who have spoken - for your support for this programme for civil protection , which we all feel is important .
I also thank you for your cooperation .
in answer to the question about how will this go forward , I can tell you that there will be no problem , there will be a pro@@ l@@ ong@@ ation .
Co@@ re@@ per discussed the Commission proposal on 15 December , and it will go as an &apos; A &apos; point - that is , one where there are no problems - to the Environment Council before Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas .
let me also say that , in the mean@@ time , the Commission intends to present a proposal for a new legal instrument with a view to its entry into force in January 2007 .
that means that this new proposal will be based on the provisions of the new constitutional Treaty for greater pos@@ sibilities to develop European cooperation in the field of civil protection ; and thus we will be working particularly in the field of prevention that you all mentioned , but also in the field of response .
the next two years will be a trans@@ itional period to prepare in the best possible way the ven@@ ue for the new Treaty , which will include many of the ite@@ ms and elements mentioned here .
you all spoke about prevention and ne@@ arly all of you mentioned the importance of contributions of volun@@ te@@ ers and also of social partnership and the question of financing , which depen@@ ds on the financial regulations .
again , we are ready to make the prepar@@ ations , and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal .
I hope that my colleague Commissioner D@@ im@@ as will then be able to discuss this very closely with you .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m .
the next item is the Commission statement on the transport of animals .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expres@@ sing my gra@@ t@@ itude for the opportunity which I have today to con@@ ve@@ y to you the Commission &apos;s views on such an important and em@@ o@@ tional issue .
I understand and share the concerns and interest of the European Parliament on such an important issue .
allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is , not only to the European Parliament , not only to the European Commission , but also to our millions of citizens and , of course , to farmers and to all the agencies involved .
I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be f@@ ed , trans@@ ported and s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered .
the need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day @-@ to @-@ day reality and not just on the sta@@ tute bo@@ o@@ k is an important objective for me .
I have long been aware of the un@@ satisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the appar@@ ent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities .
the correct and full en@@ for@@ cement of animal welfare legislation is essential , as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport .
this is why the Commission , despite its desire to do more to restric@@ t transport @-@ by @-@ road times and reduce sto@@ ck inten@@ s@@ ity on vehicles , accep@@ ts the presidency &apos;s step @-@ by @-@ step initiative in the Council .
we felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our g@@ ras@@ p , rather than to def@@ er the whole d@@ os@@ si@@ er to a later inde@@ fin@@ ite date .
this , as I will point out later , is without pre@@ jud@@ ice - and I would like to emphasise this - to any improved future solution .
in doing this , we have op@@ ted for much stric@@ ter rules , signific@@ antly improving current conditions , to be applied as soon as possible .
they will cover matters such as long @-@ dis@@ tance transport or new , substan@@ ti@@ ally up@@ gra@@ ded standards for vehicles .
these will be en@@ forced in the shor@@ test possible time within EU standards .
I wish to point out that the vas@@ t majority of Parliament &apos;s amendments have been integrated and incorpor@@ ated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution .
I have no problem in ad@@ mit@@ ting that it is unfor@@ tun@@ ate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport d@@ ens@@ ity .
there was no chance - and I have to be fran@@ k about this - of such provisions being supported in the Council , and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricul@@ tural Council was a clear war@@ ning .
but failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an inde@@ fin@@ ite contin@@ uation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement .
this does not mean , however , that the Commission does not believe that all pos@@ sibilities for reinfor@@ cing the provisions on travel time should and will be explo@@ ited in the future .
firstly - and this is not the only possibility - the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within - not after - four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and lo@@ ading d@@ ens@@ ities and pos@@ sibly to modi@@ fy its approach on the basis of the experience ac@@ qui@@ red from the application of the new rules .
however , in addition - and this is important - regar@@ d@@ less of what the regulation provides , the Commission will carefully analys@@ e the situation , including the pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing political conditions , and will ava@@ il itself of its power of initiative .
I re@@ tained this right when giving our con@@ sent to the compromise .
let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the ne@@ ar future .
I have a list of four pa@@ ges and I will not read them all .
before I do so , I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stric@@ ter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation .
therefore , this is a challenge for the Member States , and it is a challenge for you .
if enough Member States adopt stric@@ ter rules then the political pressure - the pe@@ er pressure - on the rest would be much more ev@@ ident and effective .
however , we need the improvements in the existing regulation .
firstly , a sa@@ tell@@ ite na@@ vi@@ gation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007 .
there will be forced ven@@ tila@@ tion and tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture monitoring in@@ side the truc@@ ks , with improvements in water facil@@ ities and d@@ rin@@ king facil@@ ities , individual sta@@ lls for the transport of hor@@ ses and other conditions in relation to hor@@ ses .
there will be stric@@ ter conditions for the training of dri@@ vers and a ban on trans@@ porting p@@ reg@@ n@@ ant , si@@ ck and w@@ oun@@ ded animals .
there will also be administrative provisions to ensure consisten@@ cy between chec@@ ks by officials in different Member States .
this will apply to all jour@@ ne@@ ys .
as you will be aware , the use of sa@@ tell@@ ite na@@ vi@@ gation systems was promo@@ ted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission .
this represents an innova@@ tive and promis@@ ing too@@ l to monitor animal transport , and the Commission is ready to inv@@ est immediately in this .
the proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high @-@ quality approach to animal transport in Europe , in tun@@ e with the wishes of our citizens but also enab@@ ling better en@@ for@@ cement .
this is extremely important .
it is not enough to regula@@ te or adopt rules , we must have the means to en@@ force them and to super@@ vis@@ e their en@@ for@@ cement .
European citizens have pointed out on inn@@ u@@ mer@@ able occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective en@@ for@@ cement has been an appreci@@ able we@@ ak@@ ness of the current system .
I fully agree with that .
I am determined and committed to ensuring better en@@ for@@ cement of animal welfare rules and to ins@@ is@@ ting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out .
we will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way .
to su@@ m up , we stated in the Council that the Commission reser@@ ves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty , with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals .
therefore , the Commission will continue to be vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States .
we are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement .
I would like to comment on two more issues .
first , the improvement of animal welfare is a continu@@ ous process .
it is not just a regulation , we are already working on other improvements on p@@ ou@@ l@@ try and on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ cl@@ im@@ ates within the transport vehicles .
therefore it is not the end , it is just the beginning .
at the same time , I have loo@@ ked at what the options were at the last Council meeting .
they were not between the opti@@ mu@@ m maximum and the compromise , they were between the compromise and continuing inde@@ fin@@ i@@ tely with the present situation , with all the unacceptable conditions that pre@@ va@@ il at this point .
I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision , one has to w@@ ei@@ gh the pro@@ s and con@@ s and decide in which direction to go .
I can assure you that the Commission &apos;s only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible .
it was not just to insist on a principle which even@@ tually would har@@ m the animals , because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way .
I repeat , the present compromise signific@@ antly improv@@ es the present situation without de@@ pri@@ ving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues .
believe me , it was a Commission proposal .
we would have been much hap@@ pi@@ er if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise .
but , unfortunately , there was no possibility of such an agreement .
if I may , I suggest talking to the various NGOs .
they were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realis@@ ed that it is a significant step forward .
finally - and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter - I can assure you that my intention is , before the end of this Commission &apos;s term and defin@@ i@@ tely before the end of this Parliament &apos;s term , to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion .
the Commission is committed to this .
but , the big question and the big challenge will be to conv@@ in@@ ce the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes .
. - Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou most warm@@ ly for the op@@ enn@@ ess with which he has raised this issue once more .
you have only just as@@ sum@@ ed your du@@ ties , and I think that your position at all events op@@ ens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this , too .
I am saying this with good reason : you h@@ it the na@@ il on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities .
this is our s@@ tic@@ king point , and re@@ me@@ d@@ ying it would represent tre@@ mend@@ ous progress .
I should like to give an example by way of ill@@ ustra@@ tion .
I note that , at the present time , the Austri@@ an government , in particular , is doing a good job and is exerc@@ ising good super@@ vision .
this is resul@@ ting in a large propor@@ tion of the international transport of sto@@ ck for s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter tra@@ ve@@ lling to Italy by rou@@ tes other than Austria all of a su@@ d@@ den .
this is the kind of situation that ar@@ ises when a number of other Member States ne@@ g@@ lec@@ t their du@@ ties .
in that regard , the Austri@@ an model should become the European model : with effective legislation and effective en@@ for@@ cement .
this is the way to put an end to all the un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant debate .
however , the Council has come to an agreement , and has made a cor@@ respon@@ ding amendment without giving pri@@ or no@@ tice to Parliament , which I find very dis@@ concer@@ ting and also bla@@ me@@ wor@@ thy on the part of the Council .
on the other hand , I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative , because we cannot den@@ y that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation .
you know Parliament &apos;s line of thinking .
I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum jour@@ ne@@ y time for sto@@ ck for s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter .
this has now proved un@@ atta@@ in@@ able in the Council .
nevertheless , I note that the introduction of the sa@@ tell@@ ite trac@@ king system has become a reality , at all events , and that en@@ for@@ cement of the existing rules is to be improved .
in that regard , I should like to hear how the Commission intends to en@@ force this at Member State level .
are other instruments necessary in this regard , including on the part of Parliament ?
I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training .
finally , I note that f@@ arm @-@ to @-@ f@@ arm transport has been liber@@ alised .
we should have lik@@ ed to see 100 kil@@ omet@@ res , but this was ev@@ id@@ ently un@@ atta@@ in@@ able in the Council .
nevertheless , we have taken a small step forward .
I should like to mention two other points .
first of all , there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of bre@@ eding sto@@ ck and the rest perio@@ ds stated for this .
animals must be trans@@ ported as quickly as possible , and introducing the minimum possible number of rest perio@@ ds for the tr@@ ansi@@ t of bre@@ eding sto@@ ck , too - which is undertaken in the main in very fav@@ ourable conditions - would be a step forward .
this means that animals can also be trans@@ ported over medium dis@@ tan@@ ces .
the same goes for the ro@@ l@@ l @-@ on / ro@@ l@@ l @-@ off system on fer@@ ries .
tell@@ ing Member States in pla@@ in language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help .
all this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport .
as a former rapporteur , I am a little disap@@ pointed that no maximum jour@@ ne@@ y times for sto@@ ck for s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter have been agreed .
nevertheless , I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward .
I am extremely cu@@ ri@@ ous to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 200@@ 9 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament , and also , in particular , for making Member States comply with the European rules .
. - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his words . I share his disap@@ poin@@ tment over the Council &apos;s compromise .
it brings no improvement in the jour@@ ne@@ y times for animal transport , n@@ one in the rest perio@@ ds and n@@ one in the maximum sto@@ cking d@@ ens@@ ity , and that could end@@ ure for years to come .
I wish the Council every success in attemp@@ ting to explain this compromise to the European public .
it is an extremely bad one , including for the im@@ age of the whole sector , and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view .
I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum jour@@ ne@@ y time to eight hours .
only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture , one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare .
Europe is buil@@ t in small steps , as we all know , and indeed that is a very good thing , in many cases even the best way .
whilst the EU is taking exces@@ sively small steps here towards improving animal welfare , animals in Europe are being dra@@ g@@ ged back and for@@ th for thousands of kil@@ omet@@ res in at@@ ro@@ ci@@ ous conditions .
it will be n@@ ice and reas@@ suring for them to know that they are being w@@ at@@ ched by sa@@ tell@@ ite@@ s all along .
.
Mr President , I agree with the Commissioner &apos;s statement .
this is a very important issue .
I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are f@@ ed , trans@@ ported and s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered .
as the Commissioner stated , the EU has en@@ su@@ red many improvements in animal welfare during trans@@ por@@ tation .
some of them have been mentioned already : proposals for sa@@ tell@@ ite trac@@ king systems , ven@@ tila@@ tion and tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture monitoring , stric@@ ter conditions for dri@@ ver training and a greater number of official inspec@@ tions in different countries .
progress has been made .
I also want to na@@ il my c@@ ol@@ ours to the m@@ ast because I am an ME@@ P who represents a constitu@@ ency that is both rural and ur@@ ban .
agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the nor@@ th and w@@ est of Ireland .
indeed , the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU .
live animal exports are a hu@@ g@@ ely important , legitimate business for Ireland .
we export 90 % of our animals and about 10 % of those , or 200 000 live c@@ attle , are ex@@ ported every year to markets in France , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands .
this trade is worth over EUR 1@@ 50 million ann@@ u@@ ally .
therefore , a vi@@ br@@ ant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck sector .
I believe we must have access to the single market .
there is an important market for Irish we@@ an@@ l@@ ings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hin@@ der@@ ed .
surely , free access to the market is one of the cor@@ ner@@ st@@ ones of EU policy .
we also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture , not just in Ireland , but also in the EU as a whole .
again , I agree with the Commissioner .
we need en@@ for@@ cement and no one has a problem with that - consumers or farmers , it is in all our interests .
another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland .
this is another cor@@ ner@@ st@@ one of EU policy .
I believe we have made progress ; there is probably further to go , but the Commission is doing useful work .
Mr President , I took the initiative regarding this ex@@ tra debate following the Council decision in November .
a number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years &quot; b@@ loc@@ king of the issue of protecting our animals .
this would mean that , throughout their perio@@ ds of office , neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals , a state of affairs that is quite un@@ reasonable .
the Council decision de@@ par@@ ted so completely from the proposal that I even doub@@ ted its leg@@ ality .
Mr Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou , I hope you realise your amb@@ ition of coming back with d@@ ens@@ ity figures and transport times as soon as possible .
I also hope that you make use of the Treaty &apos;s ar@@ tic@@ les concerning transport , consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure .
we could then together break the Council &apos;s res@@ is@@ tance to providing animals with reasonable conditions .
unfortunately , the Council lis@@ ten@@ s more to lob@@ by@@ ists than to opinion .
the ma@@ tur@@ ity of a society is shown by the way in which it treat@@ s those who are def@@ enc@@ eless .
if the rules govern@@ ing the transport of animals are an indic@@ a@@ tor of Europe &apos;s ma@@ tur@@ ity , we are unfortunately still bar@@ bar@@ ians .
I inv@@ ite all ministers to travel , together with myself , between Stock@@ hol@@ m and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals .
they might then understand what they have done .
if we are regar@@ ded as 75 @-@ kil@@ o s@@ he@@ ep , there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed .
if we are regar@@ ded as ch@@ ic@@ ken@@ s , we shall see how fa@@ ec@@ es from those above fall down on@@ to those bel@@ ow .
if we are regar@@ ded as pi@@ gs , we shall , in accordance with the Council decision , be given nothing less than elec@@ tri@@ c sho@@ cks if we ref@@ use to move .
we shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours .
we must also try to ensure that , in accordance with the Council rules , the tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture is kept above five degre@@ es C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de during the jour@@ ne@@ y .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are to believe what the Council says about this European Union of ours wan@@ ting to encourage sustainable development , and if we look at the reality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council goes about doing it in practice , we see that the Member States really cannot sum@@ m@@ on up the will to do it .
yet again , animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the prof@@ its of the fir@@ ms that f@@ at@@ ten them up .
I will nonetheless conc@@ ed@@ e that the Commission has made an effort , and I will not den@@ y that a number of changes have been made for the better , but the under@@ lying principle has remain@@ ed the same as it was before .
there are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the per@@ mitted d@@ ens@@ ity should not be speci@@ fied , and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quic@@ k to introduce other rules if your domestic p@@ ets were to be trans@@ ported the l@@ eng@@ th and b@@ read@@ th of Europe .
if we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals , then we need to approach this from a different ang@@ le .
the introduction of the G@@ S@@ P sa@@ tell@@ ite na@@ vi@@ gation system does , of course , achieve something ; it means that chec@@ ks can be better carried out .
there is no dispu@@ ting that .
l@@ ike@@ wise , if it is en@@ su@@ red that the animals are given water and improved ven@@ tila@@ tion , that is of course a small advan@@ ce , but it does not solve the problem .
if you want regional development , this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it , for you can raise animals , f@@ at@@ ten them up , and process them on the spo@@ t or within the local area without having to organ@@ ise these trans@@ ports from one end of the European Union to the other .
I really cannot understand how Mr Ma@@ at can descri@@ be this as tre@@ mend@@ ous progress .
I cannot see it as such .
it pat@@ ches things up , without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the tor@@ ment these animals under@@ go .
Mr President , I am a sever@@ e cr@@ iti@@ c of the damage the EU has done to Bri@@ tain and a pas@@ sion@@ ate advoc@@ ate of Bri@@ tain &apos;s with@@ dra@@ w@@ al from it .
the European Union destro@@ ys jobs - as T@@ on@@ y Bla@@ ir said in his 198@@ 3 election address .
it has also passed legislation that has led to the clos@@ ure of hun@@ dre@@ ds of local ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir@@ s .
however , this to@@ oth@@ less Parliament pass@@ es resolutions that are then ig@@ no@@ red by both the Council and the Commission .
the decisions made by this Parliament on the trans@@ por@@ tation of animals have been repe@@ a@@ tedly ig@@ no@@ red and hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous suffering continues .
over 3 million animals every year end@@ ure jour@@ ne@@ ys las@@ ting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many di@@ e in tr@@ ansi@@ t .
were this not bad enough , even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the R@@ E@@ AC@@ H Directive , and we will see millions more animals mo@@ ved around for live tes@@ ting .
to those in the outside world - the real world - who are as app@@ all@@ ed as I am by all this , I have a simple message .
I wish the European Union would inter@@ f@@ ere and legisla@@ te less , for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stu@@ pid question .
Mr President , the welfare of animals during tr@@ ansi@@ t has been a matter of continuing concern for Parliament over recent years .
I ven@@ ture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the p@@ light of the millions of children d@@ ying of star@@ vation or living in unacceptable conditions in con@@ temporary Europe .
if the humanitarian organisations ac@@ ting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their coun@@ ter@@ parts promoting the cause of animals , something could probably have been done to help the European children d@@ ying day after day .
I shall be more specific .
Parliament has issu@@ ed two opinions on animal welfare in tr@@ ansi@@ t over the last three years .
I do not believe it is appropriate to de@@ vote any more time to the matter , as for@@ tunately it was finally sett@@ led this November , following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union .
in my view , the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better .
it contained a reasonable restric@@ tion on jour@@ ne@@ y times , taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union .
I would remind the House of the times in question , namely n@@ ine hours of jour@@ ne@@ y time plu@@ s t@@ wel@@ ve for rest and a further n@@ ine hours of jour@@ ne@@ y time .
the agreement reached today under the Dutch Presidency does not imp@@ ly any change to existing regulations on jour@@ ne@@ y time .
the decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been post@@ pon@@ ed for six years .
the post@@ pon@@ ement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States .
it amounts to s@@ tal@@ em@@ ate .
nonetheless , I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have over@@ loo@@ ked , and which should be brought to the no@@ tice of the citizens .
existing regulations already impose a maximum travel time of eight hours when vehicles that do not comply with the welfare standards laid down in the regulations are used .
in addition , these standards have been ti@@ gh@@ tened up by vir@@ tu@@ e of the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers .
Mr President , I can understand why the Commission has gone along with this solution , because it is a p@@ ra@@ g@@ matic one .
the Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage .
however , it is extremely disap@@ poin@@ ting - as everyone has said - that we could not get something on jour@@ ne@@ y times , one of the key issues ; or on sto@@ cking d@@ ens@@ ities .
Member States can adopt tou@@ gh@@ er legislation .
we in this Parliament want a b@@ ig@@ ger say on these issues , but at the moment we do not have it .
I will certainly press my own government to go further on this .
I am pleased , Commissioner , that you mentioned en@@ for@@ cement .
that is one area where this legislation has fall@@ en down in the past .
you will be aware of the NGOs that have given us v@@ ide@@ o evidence of how this legislation has been by @-@ passed and ig@@ no@@ red .
you said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation .
I hope that you do .
I hope you will keep Parliament informed of what happens in the inte@@ ri@@ m .
we want to hear about what is happening with regard to reinfor@@ ced monitoring .
I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legislation .
we already have a written declaration on jour@@ ne@@ y times .
I am sure that our commitment will remain the same .
Mr President , animal protection should be mo@@ ved immediately from the agricultural head@@ ing and from Article 37 .
it could , of course , be trans@@ fer@@ red to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou who would be responsible for the matter , which s@@ oun@@ ds more reas@@ suring .
in Denmark , it is the Justice Minis@@ try that is responsible for this matter .
we regard animal protection as legal protection , but Article 37 is exclu@@ sively about increasing production and ear@@ n@@ ings .
the poor animals must su@@ ffer he@@ av@@ en knows what kind of mis@@ treatment when protection itself is subject to gre@@ ed .
it is actually gro@@ tes@@ que that export subsidies are paid when hor@@ ses , co@@ ws and s@@ he@@ ep have to be sent out of the EU .
animals that are to be s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered should only be dri@@ ven to the ne@@ ar@@ est ab@@ at@@ to@@ ir and for a maximum of eight hours .
we have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark .
animals that are not to be s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered should only be trans@@ ported for eight hours without rest , food and a change of air , and the ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ation must be in order .
that is also something fav@@ ou@@ red by a majority in Denmark .
of course , the previous Parliament stated this too , and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected .
when we obtain the new Constitution , Parliament will have the right of codecision and , if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37 , Parliament would now already have had this right .
regarding another matter - namely transparency - our Ombudsman expres@@ s@@ ly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so , so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now .
what has happened is that a strategy has been ch@@ os@@ en where@@ by a decision has been h@@ ur@@ ried through , almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remo@@ te from the decision @-@ making concerned over the next six years .
we , indeed I , have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ...
- Mr President , the problem at issue is of a cross @-@ border nature and cannot be sol@@ ved by national legislation alone .
for this reason , it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament .
for years , Parliament has been in@@ un@@ da@@ ted with pet@@ itions from people rightly calling for attention to ab@@ uses in animal transport .
this applies in particular to hor@@ ses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are des@@ tin@@ ed to be s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered and e@@ a@@ ten in the South .
many animals spen@@ d a very long time in tr@@ ansi@@ t in lor@@ ries , with little to e@@ at or d@@ rin@@ k , f@@ ou@@ l themselves , start to pan@@ ic and su@@ ffer in@@ jur@@ y .
the only way to prevent this is to d@@ ras@@ tically reduce the dis@@ tance and time per@@ mitted for the transport of live animals .
at the start of 2004 , the dispu@@ te in this Parliament was a question of eight hours ver@@ su@@ s n@@ ine hours of continu@@ ous transport and of limited , che@@ a@@ p protec@@ tive measures ver@@ su@@ s further @-@ reaching , more expen@@ sive measures .
at that time , Parliament made a very moder@@ ate choice , but even that w@@ ent too far for the governments of a number of Member States .
as a result , there is still scope for allowing those ab@@ uses to continue .
the key question is whether we accept this un@@ necessary animal suffering in anti@@ ci@@ pation of a resul@@ ting reduction in the costs of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck trade and of road transport companies , or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at vari@@ ance with our civil@@ isation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow cre@@ a@@ tures .
my choice is empha@@ tically in favour of civil@@ isation and responsibility .
what the Commissioner is now announ@@ cing is the failure of decision making in the European Union .
we have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urg@@ ently needed .
national economic interests are taking preced@@ ence over our shared civil@@ isation and responsibility .
lis@@ tening to Commissioner Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou speak , I have no doubt as to his good inten@@ tions .
I support his announ@@ cement of new initiatives by the European Commission .
I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a w@@ o@@ e@@ fully ina@@ dequate result than of no result at all .
sa@@ tell@@ ite monitoring is c@@ old com@@ for@@ t for the animals .
let us not trust sol@@ ely in new technologies , but rather build on the political will to genuinely elimin@@ ate this abuse .
that is what is important .
I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission , because what is currently taking place is an absolu@@ te dis@@ gra@@ ce .
Mr President , the transport of animals within the EU and from the EU to countries outside it has on quite a few occasions been comprehen@@ sively critic@@ ised .
most recently , we have received information about the dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful conditions under which animals have been ex@@ ported from the EU to Le@@ ban@@ on .
that wor@@ ries us .
will the Commission prior@@ it@@ ise this problem ?
we hope so , but are not completely convinced .
another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issu@@ ed by OLAF at reg@@ ular inter@@ val@@ s .
recently , these concerned compla@@ ints relating to financial fraud in connection with the transport of animals to Le@@ ban@@ on .
in pu@@ rely financial terms , subsidies for the export of animals from the EU to third countries total appro@@ xim@@ ately SE@@ K 60 @-@ 100 million per year .
does this amount to properly used tax re@@ ven@@ ue ?
we hope that the Commission will take animal protection seriously and that we do not have to read further reports concerning mis@@ used export subsidies .
Mr President , I thank the Commission for ra@@ ising this important issue for animals and human@@ s .
there is a failure of implementation , not a failure of regulation .
in fact , in many cases we have over @-@ regulation but also non @-@ implementation .
this has led to problems for farmers and those eng@@ aged in what is a very legitimate trade .
one of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers .
the new agriculture support system ur@@ ges farmers to op@@ t for market @-@ led farming .
there is a legitimate market in main@@ land Europe for young c@@ attle from Irish f@@ arms .
are we going to tell farmers that they cannot eng@@ age in this legitimate trade ?
I do not think we can , because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers .
however , animal welfare must of course also be a priority .
one colleague raised concerns about Le@@ ban@@ on .
Irish c@@ attle go to Le@@ ban@@ on .
again , it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there .
if we stop that trade , animals will still move to Le@@ ban@@ on , perhaps from Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia and other areas .
if our concerns are for animals , we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals .
as for reducing jour@@ ne@@ y times and sto@@ cking d@@ ens@@ ities , I urge that we be guid@@ ed by sci@@ ence and not em@@ o@@ tion , because this debate has been too much guid@@ ed by em@@ o@@ tion .
I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain .
I shall read one paragraph from the report : &apos; the study concluded that transport had no adver@@ se effect on animal welfare based on the p@@ hy@@ si@@ ological , im@@ mun@@ ological and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological measu@@ re@@ ments made &apos; .
finally , I would just support Mrs Her@@ ran@@ z Gar@@ ci@@ a , who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night .
I raised the issue of over half a million people in the S@@ ud@@ an who are s@@ tarv@@ ing .
the issues are not linked , but we need to put our priorities right .
M@@ r@@ President , I too would like to warm@@ ly welcome the political agreement to be presented to the Agriculture Council for for@@ mal approval next week .
I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect .
it post@@ pon@@ es the most contro@@ versi@@ al issues until 20@@ 11 .
I refer to the issues instru@@ mental in the failure of negotiations last April , namely jour@@ ne@@ y times and sto@@ cking d@@ ens@@ ities .
some of the honourable Members present today will rec@@ all the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Ma@@ at .
it emer@@ ged then that , as Mrs Mc@@ Gu@@ inn@@ ess just stated , there is no sol@@ id scientific basis regarding the two issues of jour@@ ne@@ y time and d@@ ens@@ ity .
in addition , larg@@ er Member States and the per@@ ip@@ her@@ al ones were seriously pen@@ alised .
all this economic back@@ ground was presented as an animal welfare issue , as if Members from large and per@@ ip@@ her@@ al countries were not concerned about animal welfare .
Commissioner , I believe the political agreement makes good many of the short@@ com@@ ings identi@@ fied in current provisions .
this is its most positive aspect .
it improv@@ es control systems , it introduc@@ es technolog@@ ical fe@@ a@@ tures facilita@@ ting control , it provides for a clear and transparent system of regis@@ tra@@ tion and it improv@@ es systems of cooperation between Member States .
in addition , it spe@@ lls out the duty of setting up training systems that will also improve the transport of animals .
I particularly welcome Article 32 , because it la@@ ys down clearly the basis for future re@@ views of these provisions .
for all these reasons , therefore , I am b@@ ound to congratulate the Council for moving the issue forward , and I look forward to successful implementation of the new text .
Mr President , the Commissioner spoke of the em@@ o@@ tions that are present in this House .
that this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter , but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never @-@ ending s@@ tory .
this is not the first time , not the second , and not even the third , but perhaps the ump@@ te@@ ent@@ h time that we have had to give this our attention .
for well over ten years , we have s@@ ought to make improvements in this area , and there has always been talk of progress , but the crucial progress has not materi@@ alised .
we will , I believe , achieve a real bre@@ ak@@ through only when this House ac@@ qui@@ res the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well .
I believe we are more likely to get that than the sa@@ tell@@ ite na@@ vi@@ gation system .
it is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way .
turning to the matter in hand , I would like to say that this is , of course , also about transport times , but what is of the ess@@ ence is whether the conditions are right , that is , whether the animals are car@@ ted off in tor@@ ment or whether they travel as our fellow @-@ cre@@ a@@ tures .
if some@@ one goes to the Middle East and bu@@ ys an Ara@@ bian sta@@ ll@@ ion for stu@@ d purposes , they do not need to wor@@ ry that it will arri@@ ve here in a poor condition .
l@@ ike@@ wise , if our animals travel to the Ol@@ ym@@ pic G@@ am@@ es , they will arri@@ ve in a f@@ it and proper state .
it follows that it is the conditions that matter .
what matters , I think , is that we should comply with what the consumers want .
in Germany , we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria .
organ@@ ic farming is another example , with the ne@@ ar@@ est s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter@@ house being the one that is used .
where that is a measure of quality , it will also become accepted practice .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , terri@@ ble things occ@@ ur during the transport of animals .
animals su@@ ffer from human c@@ all@@ ous@@ ness and thou@@ gh@@ t@@ less@@ ness , and improving their f@@ ate is a challenge to our human@@ ity .
it is not merely sens@@ iti@@ vity to the har@@ m done to animals that makes action necessary , but also the awareness that it is only a small step from cru@@ el@@ ty to animals to cru@@ el@@ ty to human@@ s .
the regulation under discussion mo@@ ves in the right direction .
it introduc@@ es higher standards for the protection of animals in transport , although these standards are still ina@@ dequate , and it lead@@ s one to hope that animals will su@@ ffer less .
as an ME@@ P whose vo@@ ters include Pol@@ ish farmers , I am delighted at this .
in Pol@@ ish family @-@ ow@@ ned f@@ arms , which are mainly small , animals are treated with great affec@@ tion , and even as individuals .
it brea@@ ks farmers &quot; hear@@ ts when the animals they car@@ ed for are treated br@@ u@@ ta@@ lly after being sol@@ d .
the regulation we are discussing will bring progress , but it is not a solution to the problem .
legal regulations must be ac@@ compan@@ ied by effective implementation , which can be f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght with difficul@@ ty .
Pol@@ and , for example , is a large tr@@ ansi@@ t country and it experi@@ ences problems with the transport of hor@@ ses .
legal standards have been put in place , but the monitoring bodies , police and ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary inspec@@ tors are often hel@@ pl@@ ess when faced with the problem of what to do with illegal trans@@ ports , car@@ rying in@@ ju@@ red animals for instance .
there is a need for a network of sto@@ po@@ ver points where trans@@ ported animals could be provided with food and d@@ rin@@ k or given necessary ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary care .
in urgent cases , the animals could be put down at these points if necessary .
the European Union should provide financial support for the setting up of such a network , and Pol@@ and at any rate requires such assistance .
ladies and gentlemen , a genuine bre@@ ak@@ through in the transport of animals will only come about when long @-@ dis@@ tance trans@@ ports are fully ab@@ olis@@ hed .
animals should be s@@ lau@@ gh@@ tered close to where they have been b@@ red .
humanitarian considerations are not the s@@ ole reason for this .
san@@ i@@ tary considerations are also at issue .
I would remind you that as shown by the recent report of the Court of Auditors , control is practic@@ ally lost over animals trans@@ ported ab@@ road .
ladies and gentlemen ...
Mr President , there is no doubt that this is an area that makes a big impression upon the European population .
last year alone , one animal protection organisation collec@@ ted 5@@ 00@@ .000 sig@@ na@@ tures in Denmark , that is to say half a million sig@@ na@@ tures in a country with only just over five million in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants .
all the more reason for critic@@ ising the way in which this proposal has been h@@ ur@@ ried through .
as a Member of the European Parliament , I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted .
it might well actually have been the case , Commissioner , that if there had been a little more time in which to debate this issue and if there had been a public debate sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding it in the individual countries of Europe , the ministers would have been rather more amen@@ able .
I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today .
I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure .
the big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market .
the internal market is of course a s@@ plen@@ did and com@@ mend@@ able thing but , once in a while , we must also pa@@ use and bear some eth@@ ical considerations in mind .
we are now tre@@ ating animals as if they were com@@ mod@@ ities .
animals are not com@@ mod@@ ities .
animals are living beings and must , of course , be treated as such .
I would also question whether the proposal that has now unfortunately become legislation is at all ten@@ able in pu@@ rely legal terms .
in pu@@ rely legal terms , can there be any defence of Parliament &apos;s being de@@ pri@@ ved of influence , as it has been ?
when this legislation is revis@@ ed , or in other words re @-@ examin@@ ed , it will be possible to by@@ pass Parliament .
as I see it , that alone is a good enough reason for investi@@ g@@ ating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the previous speak@@ er mentioned the internal market , but the internal market must be jud@@ ged by whether or not it oper@@ ates in a human@@ e way , and by what its effects are not only on human beings but also on other cre@@ a@@ tures .
where animal trans@@ ports are concerned , the issue is clear : whom does it benefit when animals are trans@@ ported over long dis@@ tan@@ ces ?
it is to the benefit of mass li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck farming , a form of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck farming that will get Europe no@@ where .
what we need is not just the right measures , but also str@@ ing@@ ent chec@@ ks , and this is where the attitude of the Member States cannot be described as anything other than truly sha@@ me@@ ful .
if we are to have these chec@@ ks , we need an infrastructure , and this infrastructure also means res@@ ting points , for which we must make provision , and lo@@ ading sta@@ tions where vehicles must be obliged to do@@ ck when the provisions on the protection of animals in tr@@ ansi@@ t are b@@ reached .
that must be en@@ forced , and we - this House and the Commission - must together require the Member States , once and for all , to implement in practice a new strategy for agriculture .
Mr President , I think Commissioner Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou has a difficult task in fron@@ t of him in trying to per@@ su@@ ade us that the November Council compromise is a genuinely positive step forward when it comes to live animal exports .
we know it is not , and I think you know it is not , Commissioner .
it is a great sha@@ me that the Council is not here to be held to account .
I have to say as well that I am disap@@ pointed that my own government voted in favour of this sha@@ b@@ by deal ; because a few technical improvements are now completely over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed by the failure to make any progress on jour@@ ne@@ y times and sto@@ cking d@@ ens@@ ity .
as a result , it seems this sho@@ ck@@ ingly cru@@ el practice will continue for many years to come .
I no@@ tice , however , that you expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly reser@@ ve the right to bring forward better proposals .
I welcome that , and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible , and in particular to introduce a maximum eight @-@ h@@ our jour@@ ne@@ y time for both s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter and further f@@ atten@@ ing animals .
you can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this , even more so if we have codecision .
it is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civil@@ ised society .
.
Mr President , I have noted with great interest the views expressed by Members .
I share most of your concerns and most of your views .
however , as I have already said , the Commission felt that there was a need for immediate action .
some of you said that this compromise has been r@@ us@@ hed through .
but at the same time , some of you said that this has been pen@@ ding for more than ten years .
I believe , therefore , that we had an obligation to find a solution as soon as possible , without just saying that we would not continue these efforts for improvement .
it is true that Member States can do more .
they can adopt stric@@ ter rules , not just for animals orig@@ in@@ ating from their territory but also for tr@@ ansi@@ t animals .
so there could be , through this , a possibility of stric@@ ter regulations cover@@ ing a much wid@@ er area and affec@@ ting much more transport .
as far as the subsidies are concerned I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right - because of various international agreements - to legisla@@ te on movement of animals outside the territory , nevertheless the European Union has linked the export subsidies to animal welfare requirements during transport .
therefore to link the two is a substantial step as it brings compliance to a great extent , even though not through immediate legislation .
I agree that implementation is very important .
we will put greater emphasis on the issue of travel times , including all the other improvements that need to be made .
we will ga@@ ther enough scientific evidence to be able to conv@@ in@@ ce even those who are re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant at this stage .
therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal .
on the sta@@ ging point , this regulation has increased both the welfare situation and the bi@@ o @-@ security situation .
even though I understand and share the disap@@ poin@@ tment of many of you with regard to this regulation , at the same time , we must not , through this em@@ o@@ tional approach , dis@@ regard significant improvements that have been made to the regulation .
travel times are very important - that is why they were included in the Commission proposal ; but conditions during travel are just as important .
they are being improved and dealt with in the regulation .
the Commission examin@@ ed the legal problems referred to in the way in which the decision was taken .
I can assure you that we chec@@ ked with the legal services and everything was done in a proper legal way .
while I share your concerns , we feel that this was a good compromise .
it has gone the right way .
some of us might have wanted to go one step further , or take one step less , but it is nevertheless going in the right direction .
the Commission will continue to monitor and follow the implementation . implementation is in the hands of the Member States .
agreement on any future proposal coming from the Commission will again , in the final analysis , be in the hands of the Member States .
therefore it is something on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the report by S@@ é@@ r@@ gi@@ o Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 37 / 2004 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation amen@@ ding Regulation ( EC ) No 8@@ 50 / 9@@ 8 as regards the protection of de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s from the effects of tra@@ w@@ ling in certain areas of the Atlan@@ tic Oc@@ ean ( COM ( 2004 ) 00@@ 5@@ 8 - C5 - 00@@ 7@@ 4 / 2004 - 2004 / 00@@ 20 ( CNS ) ) .
.
Mr President , I thank Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o for his report on the proposal to protect de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s from the effects of tra@@ w@@ ling in certain areas of the Atlan@@ tic Oc@@ ean .
this is the first time I have addressed the plenary of this Parliament and it is satis@@ fying that the first proposal that I am dealing with is foc@@ used upon the protection of de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s - an issue of great importance to us all .
doub@@ t@@ less , we will have many an occasion in future , both within this plenary and within the Committee on Fisheries , to discuss issues not only relating to con@@ ser@@ vation and the preser@@ vation of fish stocks but also relating to issues such as de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
having stu@@ di@@ ed the scientific evidence and considering the ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible damage that certain fishing ge@@ ar can cause to these uni@@ que ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts , we propose in this regulation to ban the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ls and similar tra@@ w@@ l ge@@ ar in the areas concerned .
with this proposal , we fulfil the commitment given at the Fisheries Council of 23 October 2003 , when the new &apos; w@@ estern waters &apos; regulation was approved to ensure protection for these ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts .
I am happy to note that the rapporteur recommen@@ ds that Parliament approve these measures , as does the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety in its opinion .
the Commission wel@@ comes the adoption of measures to minim@@ ise the impact of fishing on mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms .
they show our determination to work for the integration of environmental concerns in the common fisheries policy , as en@@ vis@@ aged in the reform of 2002 , and as repe@@ a@@ tedly called for by public opinion .
I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us .
I can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 .
however , I have difficul@@ ty in accep@@ ting Amendment No 4 , since it is not in line with the legislation on the mandate that is given to regional advis@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ils .
these coun@@ c@@ ils are to be consul@@ ted on the development of proposals for legislation , but consultation of them is not en@@ vis@@ aged on the implementation of such legislation .
as for Amendment No 5 , the Commission has difficul@@ ty accep@@ ting the substance of this amendment as it is currently wor@@ ded .
the Commission is b@@ ound to review all proposals in the light of new scientific evidence .
hence , obli@@ ging the Commission to do so in a specific time@@ fra@@ me could also work against the spirit and purpose of the proposal .
furthermore , we need to be con@@ sci@@ ous of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is very much dependent on the Member States and , therefore , the Commission is not in a position to guarantee its availa@@ bility as pres@@ cri@@ bed in the amendment , that is , within a speci@@ fied time@@ fra@@ me .
on Amendment No 6 , the Commission no@@ tes that while it could find such an amendment acceptable , it is not really necessary since the ge@@ ograph@@ ical application of the regulation is well known and already established .
as for Amendment No 7 , in accordance with scientific advice , the main threat to the very fra@@ g@@ ile de@@ ep @-@ water ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts is bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling .
damage caused by other ge@@ ar , in particular specific ge@@ ar such as gi@@ ll@@ n@@ ets and l@@ ong@@ lines , may be real , but is very min@@ or compared to the ero@@ sion effects of tra@@ w@@ ls .
furthermore , exten@@ ding the prohi@@ b@@ ition on tra@@ w@@ ling throughout the European economic zone would appear to be excessive , i@@ .@@ e@@ . would appear not to be propor@@ tion@@ ate since the majority of this area does not have sub@@ mar@@ ine fe@@ a@@ tures threa@@ tened by fishing .
in these circumstances , the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7 .
finally , the Commission has difficul@@ ty accep@@ ting Amendment No 8 , because it would create a du@@ pl@@ ication of effort .
comprehensive re@@ v@@ isions of the status of de@@ ep @-@ water fe@@ a@@ tures are currently being carried out by the International Council for the Ex@@ plo@@ itation of the Se@@ a , IC@@ ES .
this is considered to be sufficient .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the process of drawing up , discussing and voting on this report in committee was quite a surpris@@ ing learning process , show@@ ing that it is never too late to learn and to carry on learning .
I tac@@ kl@@ ed an activity with which I was only super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally fam@@ ili@@ ar and , in particular , I suppl@@ em@@ ented all the the@@ ore@@ tical knowledge that documents and stud@@ ying could provide .
by contac@@ ting and receiv@@ ing information from those connec@@ ted with the activity , those who make it their difficult li@@ vel@@ ih@@ o@@ od , those who study it thorou@@ gh@@ ly and seriously and those who have responsibilities within it , I lear@@ n@@ t a lot and I know that there is still a lot to learn .
I started with the idea that we need to protect the environment , which is subject to attacks that are likely to get worse , and I found three questions taking sha@@ pe : which pre@@ d@@ atory activities should be moder@@ ated or bann@@ ed ?
within what limits ?
under what jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion ?
after much lis@@ tening and considerable thought , I bec@@ a@@ me convinced that a ban on bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling would not be enough to protect cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s and other for@@ ma@@ tions , among which I would highlight ther@@ mal ven@@ ts .
it was proved to me that bo@@ tto@@ m g@@ ill @-@ net@@ ting was equally pre@@ d@@ atory or even more so .
that is why I expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly included it .
why is there such res@@ is@@ tance to its inclu@@ sion ?
is it because power@@ ful interests use that method ?
the Commission argu@@ es that it is because there is in@@ sufficient scientific evidence to prove the ev@@ ils of the tech@@ ni@@ que .
even if that were so , however , the prec@@ au@@ tionary principle should apply .
the del@@ im@@ itation of the areas to be protected is defined in the Commission &apos;s proposal by the criteri@@ on of degre@@ es of l@@ ong@@ itude and la@@ t@@ itude .
I consider this option to be political and not technical , or at least not only technical but with a strong political mean@@ ing .
not using the criteri@@ on of mil@@ es off@@ shor@@ e means that the connection with national exclu@@ sive economic z@@ ones can be ig@@ no@@ red or minim@@ ised as something to be for@@ go@@ t@@ ten .
in view of the negotiations , after the period that en@@ ded in November 2003 , to change the regulatory limits from 200 to 12 and then to 50 and finally to 100 mil@@ es , the failure of the Commission proposal to consider the situation created in the zone between the 100 and 200 mil@@ e limits is , in my view , serious and needs to be re@@ medi@@ ed .
all that brings us to the key issue of jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion , starting with the simple om@@ is@@ sion of the national jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions of Spain and Portugal , which was not om@@ it@@ ted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom &apos;s jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion over the re@@ ef for@@ ma@@ tions of the D@@ ar@@ w@@ in M@@ oun@@ ds off the S@@ cot@@ t@@ ish co@@ ast .
might that mean that jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion is at@@ tribu@@ ted to the United Kingdom but is den@@ ied or for@@ go@@ t@@ ten - or hid@@ den - in the case of Spain and Portugal ?
we are thus arri@@ ving at some really sensitive , fundamental issues , of the kind that life im@@ poses when we get down to practic@@ alities .
the principle of the European Union &apos;s exclu@@ sive competence over the con@@ ser@@ vation of mar@@ ine bi@@ ological resources is thus en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in this proposal even before the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty .
such a decision is highly deb@@ a@@ table and , for us , unacceptable , in@@ so@@ far as it represents the re@@ pla@@ cement of national and regional competence over part of the national territory , al@@ be@@ it under the sea , with exclu@@ sive Community competence .
the points that are clearly under discussion here are as follows : firstly , the balance between the explo@@ itation of resources and their con@@ ser@@ vation .
secondly , this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and pre@@ d@@ atory and the con@@ ser@@ vation of mar@@ ine bi@@ ological resources was under national and regional jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion on the basis of pro@@ xim@@ ity , and there are therefore no grounds to re@@ place this jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion in order to re@@ me@@ dy incor@@ rec@@ t or la@@ x practices .
thirdly , there are two kin@@ ds of fishing - cos@@ tal fishing , which is , more or less , or still is almost traditional , and industrial fishing .
the former is pen@@ alised , with a terri@@ ble impact on society and the regional econom@@ ies , by the pre@@ d@@ atory nature of the latter , which , because of its economic and political power , will more easi@@ ly continue its activities .
four@@ th@@ ly , the negotiations that are starting on total allow@@ able cat@@ ches and quo@@ ta@@ s are an indic@@ tment of equal treatment for what is different and a refu@@ tation of strateg@@ ies which , on the pre@@ text of protecting the environment , help the &apos; big fish &quot; to s@@ w@@ allow up the &apos; little fish &quot; - and the word &apos; fish &quot; can be re@@ placed with others such as &apos; bo@@ ats , &quot; &apos; fle@@ ets , &quot; &apos; interests &quot; or &apos; countries . &quot;
my report and the draft amendments that I have submitted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tried to make clear in this speech , in the hope that this House will vote for it .
I am grateful for your vote and I am also grateful for all the help and coll@@ abor@@ ation that I have had in tab@@ ling this report .
Mr President , I shall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety on behalf of Mrs H@@ ass@@ i .
when we discuss this issue , we need to imag@@ ine how it would be if the destruction taking place on the sea bed were instead to happen on land .
imag@@ ine if fores@@ ts were to be u@@ pro@@ o@@ ted , if all the animals in them were to di@@ e and if the b@@ ir@@ ds were to become sil@@ ent .
people would be up in arms .
we would all dro@@ wn in let@@ ters from an@@ x@@ ious people deman@@ ding that the fores@@ ts be protected .
now , this is happening on the sea bed .
the fores@@ ts of the sea are cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s at the bo@@ tto@@ m of the sea , among fish that are unable to cr@@ y out .
we here in Parliament must therefore speak on behalf of these bio@@ - and ec@@ o @-@ systems without a voice .
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments .
I wish therefore to emphasise that the House should support Amendment No 8 , which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety but which , unfortunately , was rejected by the Committee on Fisheries .
we must investi@@ g@@ ate what other de@@ ep @-@ sea ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts need to be protected so that we might obtain a complete list of these .
we must , of course , do this in cooperation with the IC@@ ES to avoid du@@ pl@@ ication of effort , but we must take responsibility for this list &apos;s being comp@@ iled .
I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7 , which pic@@ ks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than tra@@ w@@ l n@@ ets that can damage the sea bed .
that is why the rules should , of course , cover all equipment that may damage the sea bed , and it is wise to use the prec@@ au@@ tionary principle in these sensitive areas .
I think , however , that we should re@@ tain the Commission &apos;s proposal concerning z@@ ones and thus vote against the second half of the amendment .
the z@@ ones have a scientific basis we are able to accept .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal , which has been adopted by this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Fisheries , seeks to prevent the use of a fishing tech@@ ni@@ que that is highly dama@@ ging to the extremely fra@@ g@@ ile mar@@ ine systems of de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ als , which not only contribute their own ric@@ h@@ ness to bio@@ diversity but are also important ec@@ ological ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts for various organis@@ ms at various sta@@ ges in their life cy@@ cles .
according to the Commission , protection is given to the areas around Ma@@ de@@ ira , the Az@@ o@@ res and the Can@@ aries , ou@@ ter@@ most ar@@ ch@@ ip@@ el@@ ag@@ os where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for cen@@ tu@@ ries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preser@@ ve species but also to maintain th@@ ri@@ ving fishing communities .
at a time when we are wit@@ n@@ essing growing concern about the main@@ ten@@ ance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas de@@ vasta@@ ted by over@@ fishing , the sustainable fishing prac@@ tis@@ ed in those ar@@ ch@@ ip@@ el@@ ag@@ os deser@@ ves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it .
bes@@ ides , we are talking about areas where there is no contin@@ en@@ tal sh@@ elf and therefore the places where fishing is possible are con@@ fin@@ ed to small se@@ amounts generally associated with those de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ als .
it can be said that there is a lot of water around those ar@@ ch@@ ip@@ el@@ ag@@ os but there are not many fish or fishing areas .
it is therefore essential to safeguard and protect those areas from the destruc@@ tive - highly destruc@@ tive - activities of industrial fisheries .
the emergency measures put in place are already a help but we have to have las@@ ting solutions , and for that reason this Commission proposal is la@@ ud@@ able .
nonetheless , the proposed amendments to w@@ iden the ban on n@@ ets to include bo@@ tto@@ m g@@ ill n@@ ets make complete sense to me .
because of the an@@ ch@@ ors used and the risk of los@@ s , they can cause gh@@ ost fishing and also se@@ ab@@ ed ero@@ sion , threa@@ tening the ec@@ ological balance of the de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ als .
I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be wid@@ ened to include g@@ ill n@@ ets and also to include the 200 @-@ mil@@ e z@@ ones , because this proposal is based on maintaining what exis@@ ted until very recently .
with my knowledge of the situation , I can guarantee that by adopting these proposals we will be helping to protect the environment and the sustainable kind of fishing that we think should be based more on prevention than on c@@ ure .
. - Mr President , I should like to address a special welcome to the Commissioner on the occasion of his first speech and to offer him our best wishes for the extremely important and difficult job that he has to do .
I should also like to tell him , however , that I find it quite in@@ comprehen@@ sible in this report that , after the mis@@ take was made to liber@@ alise bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling and bo@@ tto@@ m g@@ ill n@@ ets a year ago in Regulation ( EC ) No 19@@ 5@@ 4 / 2003 , this mis@@ take is not being correc@@ ted in respect of bo@@ tto@@ m g@@ ill n@@ ets .
having read the documents produced by the Commission , which are quite specific in indic@@ ating that bo@@ tto@@ m g@@ ill n@@ ets are extra@@ ordin@@ arily har@@ m@@ ful and dama@@ ging to the environment , we are at a los@@ s to understand why the Commission wants to impose this practice in the A@@ ut@@ onom@@ ous Regi@@ on of the Az@@ o@@ res , where it has never been allowed .
that is a back@@ ward step in nature con@@ ser@@ vation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions , which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable .
Commissioner , I ask you to think this matter over more carefully .
Mr President , Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o &apos;s excellent report is on the second Commission proposal seeking to protect de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s from the effects of tra@@ w@@ ling .
the first concerned re@@ ef@@ s off the nor@@ th @-@ w@@ est co@@ ast of S@@ cot@@ land , the D@@ ar@@ w@@ in M@@ oun@@ ds , for which I was for@@ tun@@ ate enough to be rapporteur .
as with that report , it is essential to appreciate just how important de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are for the mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ yste@@ m .
they can maintain hun@@ dre@@ ds of different species of w@@ il@@ d@@ life , including many species of de@@ ep @-@ sea fish , and they are a vital focus for fish re@@ productive cy@@ cles .
in the case of de@@ ep @-@ sea fish , g@@ es@@ tation perio@@ ds are extremely long and thus any negative imp@@ acts on the ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts will have serious effects on stocks , both in the short and the long term .
we are still ga@@ ther@@ ing research on the full impact of tra@@ w@@ ling on de@@ ep @-@ sea cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s , but it certainly appears that in the short sp@@ an of time since de@@ ep @-@ sea tra@@ w@@ ling beg@@ an , hun@@ dre@@ ds or pos@@ sibly thousands of se@@ amounts and cor@@ al re@@ ef systems may have been de@@ vasta@@ ted .
the AL@@ DE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee , particularly Amendment No 4 emphas@@ ising the role of regional advis@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ils .
we commen@@ d to you the other amendments as adopted in committee .
we endorse plenary Amendment No 8 as well , since it is important to examine what other areas of de@@ ep @-@ sea cor@@ al within the EU should be closed to har@@ m@@ ful fishing methods .
we can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7 , since that f@@ its with the prec@@ au@@ tionary approach .
after considerable thought , we cannot support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of lea@@ ving some of the cor@@ al un@@ protected .
that is with real regret , since the mo@@ ti@@ vation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of con@@ ser@@ vation .
we hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seri@@ ous@@ ness of the concerns being expressed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the excellent report by Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s from the effects of dem@@ er@@ s@@ al fishing , more generally ter@@ med &apos; tra@@ w@@ ling , &quot; is ti@@ mely and bor@@ ne out by many studies in this area .
as we all know , the impact on these environ@@ ments - and this is also true for all types of mar@@ ine environment where in@@ discrimin@@ ate fishing methods are used - affec@@ ts not only pel@@ ag@@ ic and e@@ di@@ ble s@@ es@@ si@@ le species , but also ine@@ di@@ ble s@@ es@@ si@@ le organis@@ ms and , more generally , it seriously dama@@ ges key bre@@ eding environ@@ ments .
this lead@@ s to res@@ ource de@@ ple@@ tion and a resul@@ ting los@@ s of economic potential , with serious consequences for local communities , particularly small @-@ scale traditional fishing businesses .
in addition to the reasons given in the international agreements referred to in the report , the protection of such environ@@ ments is therefore an important way to achieve not only environmental protection but also stable social and economic pros@@ pects for the communities which per@@ sever@@ e in the areas in question .
this is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional res@@ ource which , as such , ought to be safe@@ guar@@ ded , not only by lim@@ iting the industrial cat@@ ch by fle@@ ets from other countries , but also by ensuring the continued existence of bre@@ eding ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts .
to that end , it is vital to involve the local communities , and especially those people involved in the sector .
I therefore believe that the authorities , local fir@@ ms and associ@@ ations in the sector , with the help of the Community institutions , in addition to w@@ at@@ ching over the protected areas should also be responsible for the reg@@ ular scientific monitoring of ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts , as well as for providing ec@@ o @-@ fri@@ en@@ dly information and ensuring the professional conduct of those involved in fishing .
it would certainly also be a good idea to encourage the produc@@ ti@@ vity of small traditional businesses by giving them modern to@@ ols for res@@ ear@@ ching , identi@@ fying and cat@@ ching their resources , so as to promote greater cat@@ ch sel@@ ec@@ ti@@ vity in the mar@@ ine environment and to make it possible for businesses like those to sur@@ vi@@ ve competition from industrial fishing fle@@ ets , particularly Jap@@ an@@ ese and US ones .
Mr President , I must begin by saying how surpris@@ ed I was to hear Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o , the rapporteur , speak in favour of amendments rejected by a majority of the Committee on Fisheries .
I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission &apos;s proposal , namely the Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o report , as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries .
we shall be voting against the amendments tabled , for the reasons I am about to give .
we are opposed to the inclu@@ sion of bo@@ tto@@ m set g@@ ill n@@ ets because , as everyone is aware , these are sta@@ tic n@@ ets .
by their very nature , they do not ero@@ de the sea bo@@ tto@@ m .
the amendment concerned ref@@ ers to a possible bi@@ ological disaster .
at most , this could be linked to the los@@ s of these n@@ ets and subsequ@@ ent so @-@ called gh@@ ost fishing A@@ s the Commissioner stated , there is no scientific data relating to areas or species .
this is why I think it is somewhat f@@ li@@ p@@ pan@@ t and a bad preced@@ ent to ban or attempt to ban ge@@ ar of this kind in the areas in question .
indeed , to follow the arguments through , the ge@@ ar would have to be bann@@ ed from all Community waters .
it would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban .
I shall now turn to the second amendment .
on the basis of criteria der@@ iv@@ ed from mar@@ ine ge@@ ology and bi@@ ology , this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be re@@ placed by the 200 @-@ mil@@ e political criteri@@ on .
it should be pointed out that , rightly or wr@@ ong@@ ly , that criteri@@ on is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law .
I must emphasise once again that cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are not loc@@ ated exclu@@ sively within a 200 @-@ mil@@ e ra@@ di@@ us from the Can@@ ary Is@@ lands , Ma@@ de@@ ira and the Az@@ o@@ res .
the scientific community accep@@ ts that cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are generally found around a 1.@@ 000 met@@ re b@@ a@@ th@@ ym@@ et@@ ri@@ c line .
in accordance with the prec@@ au@@ tionary principle , the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1.@@ 500 met@@ re b@@ a@@ th@@ ym@@ et@@ ri@@ c line Th@@ ese lines do not of course ta@@ lly with political and administrative dem@@ ar@@ c@@ ations .
in addition , in this particular instance , the z@@ ones desig@@ na@@ ted by the European Commission extend beyond the 200 @-@ mil@@ e limit in some cases .
international waters are affected .
Mr President , these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled .
Mr President , I welcomed the Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o report when it appe@@ ared , and recognised the rapporteur &apos;s effort .
this was because , along with the whole House , I believe it is important to protect de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
I am b@@ ound to say , however , that I have been very surpris@@ ed at some of the comments made by the rapporteur subsequ@@ ently .
I endorse what Mrs Fra@@ g@@ a has just said , and can only hope that little fla@@ gs similar to those ev@@ ident elsewhere in the Chamber do not su@@ d@@ den@@ ly appear in fron@@ t of Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o .
I must emphasise that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7 .
we certainly support the Commission &apos;s proposal , but we cannot agree to the addition of bo@@ tto@@ m set g@@ ill n@@ ets without any scientific justi@@ fication .
the Commission &apos;s proposal makes a reference to bo@@ tto@@ m set gi@@ ll@@ n@@ ets or similar ge@@ ar .
we believe that the addition of bo@@ tto@@ m set g@@ ill n@@ ets with no further quali@@ fication could be very d@@ et@@ r@@ imen@@ tal to certain fle@@ ets .
it could also act as a dangerous preced@@ ent .
we do not support the second part of the amendment either .
this is because it seeks to re@@ place maritime loc@@ ations established by the Commission on the basis of scientific criteria with a reference to waters under the jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion of Member States .
Mr President , de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are a res@@ ource which deser@@ ves our protection .
according to the United Nations , de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are a v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able ha@@ b@@ ita@@ t which require special attention .
IC@@ ES advis@@ es that the only way to protect c@@ old @-@ water ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts from fishing damage is to ma@@ p the ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts precisely and to close those areas to the forms of fishing that cause damage .
the only way to protect de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s is to prohi@@ bit the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ls and similar ge@@ ars .
it was early this year that this House recognised de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s , when the D@@ ar@@ w@@ in M@@ oun@@ ds , off the nor@@ th @-@ w@@ est co@@ ast of S@@ cot@@ land , were given special status as an area of con@@ ser@@ vation .
now we turn to the other de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s off the Can@@ ary Is@@ lands and around Ma@@ de@@ ira and the Az@@ o@@ res , and I hope there will be contin@@ uation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis .
de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s should not be destro@@ yed by bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling , but should be protected for future gener@@ ations to enjo@@ y .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too essentially want to express my support for Mr Ri@@ be@@ ir@@ o &apos;s report and the proposals it contains .
ensuring the sustain@@ ability of mar@@ ine bi@@ ological resources is also the best way to protect the most threa@@ tened of all species in certain parts of the Union : the human species itself .
many of the fishing communities in some coas@@ tal areas of the Union , such as the Az@@ o@@ res or Ma@@ de@@ ira , do not have any other alterna@@ tives at all for their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ o@@ ods or their sur@@ vi@@ val .
in this case , it is the Commission itself that acknowled@@ ges that we are dealing with very sensitive ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms that are highly end@@ ang@@ ered and require urgent protection , particularly since there is a considerable lack of information about them .
the simple acknowled@@ g@@ ment of such facts is more than enough reason to adopt any preven@@ tive measures that might stop the destruction of those ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts .
the proposals put forward by the rapporteur are a step in that direction .
they will therefore gain my vote and I appeal to this House to vote for them as well .
.
Mr President , I welcome the generally positive comments on the proposal , and will respond very briefly to some of the critic@@ isms made .
on the possible damage by fishing other than tra@@ w@@ ls : according to the IC@@ ES 2003 report , tra@@ w@@ ls are the main cause of damage to de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s .
there is little evidence of pas@@ sive ge@@ ar dama@@ ging cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s , although IC@@ ES men@@ tions some of these effects .
the Commission is ready to amen@@ d its proposal if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member States agree on such an amendment .
with regard to the point concerning the extension of the protec@@ tive zone to the whole E@@ E@@ Z , I would under@@ line that the proposal del@@ im@@ ited an area that includes most of the sub@@ mar@@ ine moun@@ tain@@ s that have been kept in good condition .
exten@@ ding the zone of prohi@@ b@@ ition would add in@@ significant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of propor@@ tion@@ ality .
having said that , I would also refer to the question of the exclu@@ sive competence of the Commission with regard to mar@@ ine resources , which is found in the Constitution and to which reference has been made .
this is a principle which was already established by European Court of Justice case law , and all the Constitution does is to co@@ di@@ fy it .
however , the Commission does not den@@ y the rights of Spain and Portugal over their European Economic Z@@ one .
it is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion since the area of prohi@@ b@@ ition is del@@ im@@ ited by to@@ po@@ gra@@ ph@@ y and by ge@@ ograph@@ ical fe@@ a@@ tures .
on the point made by Mrs A@@ t@@ tw@@ o@@ ol@@ l concerning the role of the regional advis@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ils , there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amendment the regulation on R@@ AC@@ s would itself have to be amended .
on another point made by Mrs A@@ t@@ tw@@ o@@ ol@@ l , the Commission has recently tabled a proposal on conditions for de@@ ep @-@ water fishing , which will l@@ end protection to these important resources .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m .
I should like to welcome a delegation from the parliament of Ser@@ bia and Mon@@ te@@ ne@@ gr@@ o , who have come to Strasbourg in order to take part in their first inter@@ parliamentary meeting with the European Parliament , and who are se@@ ated in the official g@@ all@@ er@@ y .
the delegation is led by the parliament &apos;s presid@@ ent , Mr Z@@ or@@ an S@@ am@@ i .
I hope that this event mar@@ ks the beginning of fru@@ it@@ ful cooperation between our two institutions .
the next item is the vote .
( 1 )
Mr President , I should like to give no@@ tice of some technical amendments before the vote .
I have been man@@ da@@ ted to do so by the Committee on Budgets .
I refer to Budget L@@ ine 15 0@@ 3 01 02 - Le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da V@@ inc@@ i Programme , where the amount shown under commitments should be modi@@ fied to read EUR 20@@ 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 6@@ 6@@ .@@ 8@@ 80 .
in Budget L@@ ine 19 0@@ 9 0@@ 3 - A@@ id to dis@@ placed persons in Latin American countries , the relevant amount from the reser@@ ve should be ente@@ red , namely EUR 5@@ 4@@ .@@ 500 less than the amount given in D@@ oc@@ u@@ ment 12 .
I trust the House will agree to these amendments .
if there are no objec@@ tions , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o &apos;s technical amendments are accepted .
Mr President , there is nothing sec@@ ret about the statement I now make on the basis of Rule 15@@ 7 ; on the contrary , I make it open@@ ly .
our group has had a discussion about the amount to be approved under item 3 .
this has to do with a great ga@@ ther@@ ing in the R@@ hin@@ el@@ and , from which I come , where the Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic Ch@@ ur@@ ch , among other bodies , is organis@@ ing a great ga@@ ther@@ ing of young people .
I myself am fam@@ ili@@ ar with this meeting , having once been able , in another capacity , to take part in it .
it is a good thing .
this meeting is to include a state visit by the P@@ ope .
his H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess will be atten@@ ding this meeting , and what we would like to be certain of is that the ga@@ ther@@ ing &apos;s organis@@ ers are asked to provide the EU institutions with docu@@ mentary confir@@ mation that n@@ one of this money will be used to fund the P@@ ope &apos;s state visit .
the V@@ ati@@ can itself will have to pay for that .
Mr President , this is a point of order under the same Rule under which you allowed Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z to speak .
I should like to note that this is a clear viol@@ ation of the Rules of Procedure , as well as of the principles of good tas@@ te .
Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z appears not to understand that the spirit and eth@@ ical and mor@@ al principles exist al@@ ong@@ side the law .
I should like to remind Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z of this fact .
the budget is approved .
does the Council wish to comment , or is it satisfied with Parliament &apos;s approval ?
Mr President , you have proceed@@ ed to your second reading on the 2005 budget - the first full budgetary year of the European Union of 25 Member States and of the implementation of the new Sta@@ ff Re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions .
I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions during the conciliation meeting on 25 November 2004 has now been included in the 2005 budget .
it is very important that for the first year of the new term of this Parliament the two arms of the budgetary authority were able to reach global agreement last November .
it is a positive signal for the future , both for inter@@ institutional cooperation and for a good budget for the European Union .
that is why I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Cha@@ irman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Le@@ wan@@ do@@ w@@ s@@ ki , and the two rapporteurs , Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o and Mrs J@@ en@@ sen .
I would also like to thank the Commissioner , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , whose role I have appreci@@ ated very much .
the Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resul@@ ting from your second reading .
thank you very much , Minister .
Mr President , I should like to table an oral amendment to R@@ ec@@ ital A very briefly - .
the amendment involves enter@@ ing the relevant amounts .
I shall read it in Spanish :
&apos;@@ A@@ . where@@ as the Budget for 2005 as adopted by the Parliament amounts to EUR 1@@ 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 5@@ 4@@ .@@ 13@@ 5@@ .@@ 6@@ 9@@ 8 in commitments , which represents an increase of 6@@ .@@ 1 % on the 2004 budget ; and EUR 10@@ 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 00@@ .@@ 00@@ 0@@ .000 in payments , which represents an increase of 4@@ .@@ 4 % on the 2004 Budget ; where@@ as this level of payments represents 1.@@ 00@@ 4 % of estima@@ ted G@@ N@@ I for the year 2005 , compared to 1.@@ 0@@ 8 % as established by the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive , a difference of EUR 7@@ .@@ 9@@ 35 million , &quot;
Mr President , could you s@@ low matters down , because the trans@@ la@@ tions , which are being rela@@ yed , are reaching us at the time of the following vote ?
take account of the trans@@ la@@ tions intended for the new Member States , which are not done as quickly as those for the old Member States .
( 2 )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to give a very brief explanation of why our group has with@@ drawn its support for this joint motion for a resolution .
the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament was opposed in principle to this procedure , it being our beli@@ ef that the Commission should first present its programme , with Parliament then sta@@ ting its position with respect to it .
we did not manage to get this accepted by the Conference of Presidents and the procedure was adopted .
up to a certain point , we were able to support the wor@@ ding of the resolution as it stands ; it also includes many points that we can live with and accept .
there are , however , a number of essential elements in this text that lead us in this Group - after a long debate yesterday evening - to believe at present that it is the Commission that should first state its position on these points rather than Parliament .
we therefore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State , under which the government first pres@@ ents its programme and the parliament then states where it stands on it .
that is what should be done in this instance too , and so we now expect the Commission to present its programme .
we will not be particip@@ ating in this vote .
Mr President , if the Soci@@ alist Group has been able to say what it thin@@ ks about this procedure under Rule 15@@ 2 , then other groups should also be allowed to do so .
we are very disap@@ pointed that the PSE Group has with@@ drawn its name from the joint text , even though it was negoti@@ ated by two of their vice @-@ cha@@ ir@@ men .
we also hope that the PSE Group realis@@ es that by voting against the compromise it is taking the risk that Parliament will not have a position on the new Commission &apos;s strategic policy objectives .
does the PSE Group really want this to happen and spo@@ il the re@@ pu@@ tation of the European Parliament ?
I think the House has been en@@ li@@ gh@@ tened by the positions expressed by Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z and Mrs E@@ k .
we support the idea of having a flexibility instrument in the EU budget in order to obtain a bud@@ g@@ et@@ ing mar@@ gin for pu@@ rely unfor@@ eseen expenditure .
the objectives must then be dealt with under separate arrangements .
they may in themselves be of quite different kin@@ ds .
for example , the Pe@@ ace II programme is something justified in terms of its being an internal matter for the EU , while we are opposed to the EU &apos;s being involved , as an organisation , in funding the reconstruction of Iraq .
the Member States themselves must decide about such efforts in accordance with democratic decisions in each of those States .
. - A@@ s we all know , the flexibility instrument , which has a c@@ eil@@ ing of EUR 200 million , is intended to allow financing in a given financial year of specifically identi@@ fied expenditure which could not be finan@@ ced within the c@@ eil@@ ings available for one or more other head@@ ings .
it is an extremely important mechanism for sol@@ ving emer@@ ging needs .
in the specific case of this year , I also consider it essential that the European Union should mo@@ bil@@ ise the flexibility instrument to finance the Community &apos;s involvement in the re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation , reconstruction and sta@@ bil@@ isation of Iraq , as ple@@ d@@ ged at the Mad@@ rid Minis@@ teri@@ al Conference , and also to support the peace consolid@@ ation process in the Republic of Ireland , which has been experienc@@ ing growing ins@@ tability .
with regard to the issue of the dec@@ entr@@ alised agencies , I believe the time has come to find a structural solution to the ever @-@ increasing v@@ olu@@ me of funding that they need , and to re@@ conc@@ ile their funding with the needs of internal policies .
overall , I voted in favour .
. - T@@ his proposal to reject the budget for 2005 , which my group put forward and to which I made a significant contribution , is not only appropriate but also consistent .
it help@@ s to clarify the responsibilities of those political forces which deal out criticism but do not mat@@ ch it with action .
I therefore regret the rejec@@ tion of the rejec@@ tion .
the proposal for rejec@@ tion is appropriate , because this is the first full year of the enlarged EU , with its additional cohesion requirements , and a key year in the debate on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
it is therefore unacceptable to produce a Community budget for 2005 that has only been set above 1 % of the Community G@@ N@@ I ( by thou@@ san@@ d@@ ths of a per cent ) for p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological reasons , while it hid@@ es its clear conc@@ ord@@ ance with the objectives of the sig@@ n@@ ator@@ ies to the &apos; L@@ et@@ ter of the S@@ i@@ x &quot; to continue the 2004 budget , the low@@ est in rela@@ tive terms since 198@@ 7 .
many thanks , Mr President .
I should like to explain that I voted in favour of Amendment No 12@@ 7 in Sec@@ tion I@@ II on funding for World Y@@ outh D@@ ay , because this does not form part of an official state visit .
instead it is a meeting of young European Christi@@ ans with the most no@@ ble of goals .
if it were not for Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z &apos;s ide@@ ological ob@@ s@@ tin@@ acy , he would be able to see how much Europe could benefit from a meeting between its young people and the H@@ ol@@ y F@@ a@@ ther .
if it were not for Mr Sch@@ ul@@ z &apos;s ide@@ ological ob@@ s@@ tin@@ acy and re@@ lu@@ c@@ tance to take an hon@@ est approach to the issue , he would not have conf@@ used it with an official visit by a head of state , namely the P@@ ope &apos;s visit to the F@@ eder@@ al Republic of Germany .
. - I took an active role in the conciliation meetings which reached agreement on the European Union budget for 2005 .
that is good reason to feel pro@@ ud and satisfied .
failure of the negotiations on the enlarged EU &apos;s first budget would have been a terri@@ ble political signal to send out to Europe &apos;s citizens .
it would have been a sign of our in@@ ability to go@@ ver@@ n ourselves with 25 Member States .
all Community policies will be du@@ ly fun@@ ded in 2005 , in accordance with the established priorities .
compared with 2004 , this budget will have an increase of 6@@ .@@ 5 % and will rise above the symb@@ ol@@ ic value of 1 % of G@@ N@@ I .
the Council , Parliament and the Commission have agreed to a statement by which the level of payments will be examin@@ ed in mid @-@ 2005 and , if necessary , the budget lines in question will be suppl@@ em@@ ented .
Portugal &apos;s priorities are taken into account finan@@ ci@@ ally in 2005 .
there is greater provision for regional and cohesion policy , as well as for the common agricultural policy with its pil@@ ot projects , and there are more funds for conclu@@ ding agreements on fisheries .
a budget is evidence of the credibility of the objectives that have been set out .
it is poin@@ t@@ less to make gr@@ and political statements without providing the funding to put such inten@@ tions into practice .
the budget for 2005 is therefore a credi@@ ble instrument .
the budget resolution states that the European Parliament regre@@ ts the Council &apos;s comprehensive reduction in payments in the agricultural sp@@ here .
we , Mr An@@ der@@ ss@@ on , Mrs H@@ ed@@ h , Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ vis@@ t Pe@@ ter@@ sen , Mrs Se@@ g@@ el@@ strö@@ m and Mrs W@@ es@@ t@@ l@@ und , do not agree with this .
we see no reason for wan@@ ting , in the agricultural sp@@ here , to increase payments further in relation to the Council &apos;s proposal .
.
the Mo@@ der@@ ate delegation has today ab@@ sta@@ ined from voting in the final vote on the resolution .
the resolution contains much that is la@@ ud@@ able in our view but , because we voted against quite a few of the proposed expenditure increas@@ es in the vote on the figures for the budget , it was impossible for us fully to support the resolution &apos;s conclusions .
we do not agree with the general criticism made of the Council for having reduced the siz@@ e of the budget .
that is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid .
we are pleased that the Council is taking a step in the right direction by reducing this .
we believe , however , that agricultural policy is in need of ra@@ dical reform and we should therefore have prefer@@ red there to have been further reduc@@ tions .
we ch@@ ose to vote in favour of Mr G@@ arri@@ g@@ a P@@ oll@@ ed@@ o &apos;s and Mrs J@@ en@@ sen &apos;s report in s@@ pite of paragraph 2 , which regre@@ ts the Council &apos;s reduction in payments to agriculture .
that is a paragraph we cannot support .
it is unacceptable for the same budgetary line to contain two ite@@ ms of funding as distinc@@ t as that for the si@@ x@@ tiet@@ h an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the end of fas@@ c@@ ism and that for the P@@ ope &apos;s visit to C@@ olog@@ ne .
I d@@ are to hope that this bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ u@@ sion is not the result of any sha@@ me@@ ful bar@@ ga@@ ining .
the ga@@ ther@@ ing of young people that the latter event would at@@ trac@@ t must not be fun@@ ded from the European budget , but by the Ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic Ch@@ ur@@ ch , which the event will serve to promote .
I am voting against this expenditure at a time when so many other s@@ pon@@ ta@@ ne@@ ous initiatives by young people do not manage to benefit from European cre@@ d@@ its .
. - O@@ ur position is clear and well known : we are against the war and the US @-@ British occu@@ pation in Iraq and we demand the immediate with@@ dra@@ w@@ al of the occ@@ up@@ ying forces from that country .
that position justi@@ f@@ ies rejec@@ tion of the proposal that the European Union should finance the reconstruction of Iraq out of its Community budget .
of course , we support the increase in humanitarian and food aid to the Iraqi population , but we cannot accept that our aid should be used to legitim@@ ise what happened or to benefit the ag@@ g@@ res@@ s@@ or .
lea@@ ving asi@@ de positions of principle , it is unacceptable that that aid should be finan@@ ced to the d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ ent of the European Union &apos;s cooperation and development policy - in other words , at the expen@@ se of the less developed countries - just as it is also unacceptable that there should be no multi@@ annual framework programme , as there was in the case of the Balkans .
we are aware that this report de@@ als with the kind of funding to adopt or , in other words , how to mo@@ bil@@ ise an ex@@ tra EUR 18@@ 5 million which would otherwise have to be found by re@@ de@@ plo@@ yment from other budget head@@ ings .
we are also aware that the additional amounts will be used to finance the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme and the dec@@ entr@@ alised agencies , and that the agreed amounts are less than what is needed and will not solve the funding requirements .
the June Lis@@ t re@@ jects Parliament &apos;s draft budget for 2005 , which involves the EU &apos;s commitments increasing to 1.@@ 24 % of the EU countries &quot; anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ted gro@@ s@@ s domestic income .
we believe that the commitments for 2005 defin@@ i@@ tely should not exc@@ eed the Commission &apos;s proposal of 1.@@ 14 % .
even though the payments still do not exc@@ eed 1 % of gro@@ s@@ s domestic income , these will gradu@@ ally increase to the level of the commitments in the 2005 budget .
this forms the point of de@@ par@@ ture for the long @-@ term financial framework .
that is why it is important to come down to a lower level by no later than 2005 .
the aim should be to come down bel@@ ow the expenditure c@@ eil@@ ing of 1 % of gro@@ s@@ s domestic income .
bel@@ ow is a sel@@ ec@@ tion of proposed cut @-@ bac@@ ks :
* W@@ e believe that the EU should begin cu@@ tting back on agricultural aid by no later than 2005 .
* The subsi@@ dy to EU political parties should be completely ab@@ olis@@ hed .
* The subsi@@ dy for tobacco cul@@ ti@@ vation should be ab@@ olis@@ hed .
it should be the responsibility of the individual countries success@@ fully to help the farmers concerned conver@@ t to other cro@@ ps .
* The subsi@@ dy for information provision can be reduced because we believe it to be difficult , politically , to provide objective information pri@@ or to the referendu@@ ms on the Constitution .
we believe it is the responsibility of the individual countries and of the political parties in these countries to provide such information .
the EU should avoid inter@@ fer@@ ing in the democratic process in the Member States .
the Danish Liberal Party &apos;s Members of the European Parliament - Mrs Ri@@ is @-@ J@@ ø@@ r@@ gen@@ sen , Mr Bus@@ k and Mrs J@@ en@@ sen - voted against Amendment No 3 , tabled by the In@@ depend@@ ence and Democ@@ racy Group .
the Liberal Party is in favour of re@@ form@@ ing the payment of travel expen@@ ses in such a way that all reasonable and necessary travel expen@@ ses are re@@ fun@@ ded .
that is not something that will be guaranteed by this amendment .
. - Con@@ sis@@ tent with our proposal to reject the Community budget for 2005 , we voted against this report , which reflec@@ ts the degree of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and wh@@ ite@@ w@@ as@@ hing that has run through the budgetary procedure that is now ending .
Parliament is critic@@ ising the Council , compla@@ ining that it is reducing payments in agriculture , that it does not accept its proposals , that it is un@@ willing to ass@@ ess the needs of the European agencies and that it has forced it to make cu@@ ts compared with first reading ; more than enough reasons for rejec@@ ting it .
despite this sc@@ en@@ ar@@ io , Parliament wel@@ comes the agreement reached with the Council at the conciliation of 25 November and wh@@ ite@@ w@@ as@@ hes the procedure by claim@@ ing that , thanks to its efforts , &apos; d@@ ras@@ tic cu@@ ts were avoid@@ ed &quot; and its traditional priorities were re@@ tained , which is man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ tly un@@ true .
unfortunately , that has been the s@@ tory of all the budgetary procedures since 2000 .
in that time , the flexibility instrument has been used five times in a row , thereby justi@@ fying the Portuguese Commun@@ ist Party &apos;s proposal to review the current financial perspective .
every year , Parliament accep@@ ts terms that call even its budgetary powers into question , for the sa@@ ke of the sa@@ cro@@ san@@ c@@ t Stability Pact .
that beg@@ s the question , then , of why it wants to strengthen its powers if it does not make use of them .
. - I wish to reiterate the comments already made at first reading , regre@@ tting that this draft budget for the financial year 2005 should , overall , total only 1.@@ 00@@ 4 % of the G@@ ross D@@ om@@ es@@ tic Pro@@ duc@@ t ( G@@ DP ) of the 25 European Union Member States .
I should like it to be more ambitious , as is essential after the accession of ten new Member States , and to make sense of the dis@@ course of those who say they want to develop institutional Europe by moving into new policies and areas of responsibility .
in view of the negotiations as a whole , however , and the real economic and financial difficulties of the current situation , I would highlight certain results that were achieved in the difficult conciliation process .
I believe it is significant that we have got past the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological th@@ res@@ hold of the 1 % imposed in the &apos; L@@ et@@ ter of the S@@ i@@ x , &quot; even if only by a tin@@ y amount .
I consider certain advan@@ ces to have been positive , namely in the area of maritime safety ( particularly pollution ) and the main@@ ten@@ ance of the framework of structural policies and external policies , especially in development aid ; I also welcome the special relation@@ ships with ACP countries .
the rapporteur &apos;s comments are realistic and point to a certain in@@ consisten@@ cy in the project announced in the Commission &apos;s proposal , that this would be the budget of &apos; competitiveness and cohesion . &quot;
I expect something much better from the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
we believe that the European Union &apos;s policy on fisheries agreements needs to be revis@@ ed .
over @-@ explo@@ itation of fishing waters forces people into even greater poverty and ro@@ bs the mar@@ ine environment of a vital link in the food cha@@ in .
it would be better if those countries with which the EU en@@ ters into fisheries agreements were instead to be given assistance so that they themselves might develop their own fishing indus@@ tries .
we do not accept amendments where@@ by the Commission would be given an independent source of income .
we believe that , if the EU conclu@@ des a fisheries agreement with a third country , the total amount of financial compensation for this third country must be fun@@ ded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels make use of what is offer@@ ed under the agreement in question .
the Member States should pay in propor@@ tion to the siz@@ e of their cat@@ ches .
these Member States must then each decide for themselves whether they , in turn , will fund this expenditure by tax@@ ing their respec@@ tive fishing vessels .
. - I voted for this report because of the importance of the issue of fisheries to Portugal , specifically in the case of international fisheries agreements in which the Portuguese fishing industry has a direct interest .
my vote was also based on the fact that an extension of the existing pro@@ tocol is on the table and the suggested amendments do not damage national interests in any way .
. - T@@ his proposal is about addres@@ sing the period between the ex@@ p@@ ir@@ y of the pro@@ tocol atta@@ ched to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Isla@@ mic F@@ eder@@ al Republic of the Com@@ o@@ ro@@ s and the date by which the Commission believes the assess@@ ments needed to rene@@ goti@@ ate the agreement will have been comple@@ ted .
in view of the considerable activity by the Community fleet in that mar@@ ine area ( 40 tuna se@@ in@@ ers and 25 sur@@ face l@@ ong@@ lin@@ ers ) , the proposed solution is to extend the previous agreement until a new fisheries pro@@ tocol has been concluded .
extension will not mean any change to the terms and restrictions of the previous pro@@ tocol , and the financial compensation and fishing opportunities for the Member States will be maintained .
as the Portuguese fleet has fishing opportunities for five sur@@ face l@@ ong@@ lin@@ ers in that area , it is important that Portugal should support this extension and press for a fav@@ ourable rene@@ goti@@ ation of the agreement .
I voted for the report .
. - I am delighted at the decision that Article 6@@ 7 of the Treaty can be fully implemented , so that to@@ pic@@ s under T@@ it@@ le I@@ V , such as immigration , asylum and border controls , can be decided by qualified majority voting under the codecision procedure .
we improve efficiency and we strengthen the role of this Parliament , guarante@@ eing the principle of democratic legitim@@ acy , which is fundamental for the adoption of legislation on to@@ pic@@ s as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and others that involve people &apos;s fundamental rights .
I support Mr B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges &apos;s report as well as the two concrete proposals that he makes , because :
- codecision and qualified majority voting on legal immigration are essential for the management of the Union &apos;s mi@@ gration policy .
with the sig@@ ning of the Constitution on 29 October 2004 , it was made clear that the measures laid down on legal immigration must not affect the Member States &quot; right to determin@@ e the number of third country nationals they can ad@@ mit to their territor@@ ies for the purpose of seeking work there .
- the restrictions on the Court &apos;s competences in T@@ it@@ le I@@ V that were introduced at Amster@@ dam , as there were fe@@ ars of too much work and excessive dela@@ ys , do not make sense either , given the introduction at Nice of Article 2@@ 25 ( a ) ...
.
legislation on asylum and immigration policy has for years been prof@@ oun@@ dly un@@ democratic .
one thing the Treaty of Amster@@ dam did was to transfer legislative powers in this area from the Member States to the EC , thus taking it out of the hands of national parliaments ; another was to hand it over to the Council exclu@@ sively , and hence to the ass@@ emb@@ led national execu@@ tives , with Parliament &apos;s involvement limited to the sta@@ ting of positions .
in an area such as this , with such considerable implications for fundamental rights , it is un@@ ten@@ able that the execu@@ tive should make law in this way .
this draft Council decision on the adoption of the codecision procedure is thus a long over@@ due step towards giving Parliament a greater say in legislation .
at the same time , though , the Council is planning to reser@@ ve again certain areas exclu@@ sively to the execu@@ tive .
this is precisely what the B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges report critic@@ ises , and that is why I endorse the report .
what I see as problem@@ atic about this report , however , is that it ins@@ ists upon a provision in the Constitution where@@ by Member States can unila@@ ter@@ ally b@@ ar third @-@ country nationals from ga@@ ining access to the labour market .
when I was a member of the Constitutional Convention , I was critical of this rule , which was introduced into the Constitution by the German Government .
not only does it reflect national e@@ go@@ isms , but also - and this is a much more serious matter - it run@@ s counter to the principle that workers should enjo@@ y freedom of movement in a common Europe .
in my judg@@ ement , this provision is one of the first things that should be submitted to scru@@ tin@@ y after the Constitution has ente@@ red into force .
. - The rapporteur s@@ ought to propose that the Court of Justice should have its competence broad@@ ened through the re@@ vo@@ cation of Article 6@@ 8 of the EC Treaty .
that was an addition to the proposal for a Council decision , in that several areas of T@@ it@@ le I@@ V , Par@@ t I@@ II of the EC Treaty ( vis@@ as , asylum , immigration and other policies concerning the free movement of persons ) would then be govern@@ ed by Article 2@@ 5@@ 1 of the EC Treaty .
as I have already argu@@ ed on other occasions , I think that the Union should gradu@@ ally consolid@@ ate its competences and practices rather than try to satis@@ fy a constan@@ t app@@ et@@ ite for new competences .
every proposal de@@ als with sensitive material , and the report &apos;s addition su@@ ff@@ ers from the max@@ im@@ alism typ@@ ical of a cen@@ tr@@ alis@@ ing Europe , even though that path does not enjo@@ y pop@@ ular support .
I am not sure that the proposed re@@ vo@@ cation would strengthen the legal protection of European citizens and third country nationals in the sli@@ gh@@ test , as Mr B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges claim@@ s it would .
I believe , rather , that it would have exactly the opposite effect .
I think Parliament would do better if it con@@ fin@@ ed itself to supporting the proposal for a decision as presented - which in itself represents a major , ambitious advan@@ ce for the area of freedom , security and justice - and if it could re@@ fra@@ in from embar@@ king on this un@@ heal@@ thy , v@@ or@@ ac@@ ious pursu@@ it of &apos; what lies beyond . &quot;
the measures proposed in the report - those designed to strengthen democracy , human rights and the func@@ tion of the constitutional state in third countries - are b@@ ad@@ ly required and often necessary .
we wonder , however , whether these measures should be implemented by the EU .
with its long experience and global importance , the UN is better placed to implement them .
we also ob@@ ject to the large su@@ m of money - appro@@ xim@@ ately EUR 2@@ 25 million - appropri@@ ated for these efforts for the period 2005 @-@ 2006 .
the objectives and the efforts concerned are not clearly defined or limited , and experience of the EU &apos;s ability to use such money is not encouraging .
for these reasons , we choose to vote against the report .
. - The subject of the Commission &apos;s proposal , which the rapporteur endor@@ ses , is to maintain until the end of 2006 a legal basis and a financial framework for operations to protect and promote human rights and democratic principles in developing countries and other third countries .
I voted for it because I consider that to do so would be both extremely useful and thorou@@ gh@@ ly justified at a time when very important questions regarding the Community &apos;s foreign policy are at sta@@ ke .
. - Community funding under the present regulation takes the form of subsidies or contracts , which the Commission is proposing should also be extended to cor@@ por@@ ate bodies where appropriate .
I agree with that .
participation by civil society should be supported , regar@@ d@@ less of the kind of the institutional structure involved in each individual case .
it is im@@ per@@ ative that the European Union should continue , improve and inten@@ si@@ fy the actions described in the Commission communication of 8 May 2001 entitled &apos; The European Union &apos;s role in promoting human rights and democ@@ rat@@ isation in third countries . &quot;
the European Union is the last w@@ in@@ dow of hope in the e@@ yes of many people .
as the Committee on Foreign Affairs demonstrated ( with only one abs@@ ten@@ tion ) , we must therefore provide the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights ( E@@ ID@@ H@@ R ) with all possible instruments to fulfil its objectives , foc@@ using primarily on support for democ@@ rat@@ isation , good governance and the rule of law .
for the rest , I refer to the speech I made yesterday during the debate in the House .
I voted for the report , of course .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
I wanted to say that I voted in favour of the report and that I hope we will be able to make considerable progress in this area in future .
I also addressed a question to the new Commission about this , sugges@@ ting the introduction of civil@@ ian service for young people in the European Union - whether m@@ ale or f@@ em@@ ale - primarily to create the right conditions in such situations , resul@@ ting in a greater sense of responsibility and awareness among the people in the European Union , not only when disas@@ ters strik@@ e , but also during a civil@@ ian service designed to increase solidarity .
as I have said , I am generally in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done along these lines .
. I have voted against the Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is report today .
a look back re@@ ve@@ als this to be consistent with my past voting .
the reason is that , in my opinion , the Community action programme does not pass the subsidiarity test .
the Member States all have their own civil @-@ protection programmes and their own coordination , training and assistance programmes .
some European cooperation is in order , but a separate European centre with its own powers and 24 @-@ h@@ our monitoring is un@@ necessary .
bes@@ ides , the financial basis for the proposal is fla@@ wed , which is a second reason for me to with@@ hold my support for this proposal .
.
natural disas@@ ters such as f@@ loo@@ ds , he@@ at @-@ wa@@ ves , for@@ est fi@@ res , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es , environmental disas@@ ters caused by to@@ x@@ ic waste rele@@ ase , to@@ x@@ ic industrial accidents , serious industrial accidents and terrorist attacks are , by nature , extremely un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table , and consequently claim coun@@ t@@ less victims and cause significant economic damage .
what we must do is work together and exchange information , stre@@ am@@ line resources , carry out research and seek technical solutions that limit the damage as far as possible , but most importan@@ tly , we must pursue a policy of inves@@ ting in prevention and education involving political institutions at Community , national , regional and local level and all civil society organisations in a uni@@ fied , responsible and differ@@ enti@@ ated partnership .
people say , in their in@@ fin@@ ite wis@@ dom , that &apos; prevention is better than c@@ ure , &quot; and this dic@@ tu@@ m ap@@ tly applies to the for@@ est fi@@ res that de@@ vasta@@ ted Portugal in the sum@@ m@@ ers of 2003 and 2004 and to the oil spi@@ lls from the and tan@@ kers .
we welcome the fact that the Community action plan in the field of civil protection has been extended and that its budget has been increased , but we also feel that this is an issue that , in light of its permanent nature , should not be subject to time con@@ stra@@ ints .
civil protection intervention also fall@@ s under the categ@@ ory of ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am@@ ing : based on new agricultural mo@@ del@@ s and land @-@ use planning that human@@ ises ur@@ ban and industrial growth ...
there is a significant risk of the financial resources provided going on administration and of the resources thus not being coordin@@ ated effici@@ ently enough .
although we are very well dis@@ posed towards different countries show@@ ing solidarity with one another when disas@@ ters occ@@ ur , we do not believe that this is primarily an issue for the EU , but that the Member States &quot; respec@@ tive national parliaments should decide what financial resources should be provided when a serious accident oc@@ cur@@ s in another Member State .
. - W@@ e would like to obser@@ ve that financing of actions for natural and man @-@ made disas@@ ters is so limited that , essentially , it can@@ cel@@ s out any possibility of material intervention and efficiency .
for us , damage prevention is more important than c@@ ure , by which we mean supporting policies , actions and infrastruc@@ tures which limit damage and los@@ ses in the event of disaster .
however , how can this happen when everything is jud@@ ged by de@@ pres@@ sing financial criteria and the interests of big business ?
when a series of public competences is trans@@ fer@@ red to private individuals , how can anyone talk seriously of the adoption of a fundamental policy of protection against any sort of disaster ?
when no money is available for anti @-@ flo@@ od works , when anti @-@ ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke standards are not met , when fores@@ ts are left at the mer@@ cy of ar@@ s@@ on@@ ists and land can@@ ni@@ b@@ als , when shi@@ pow@@ ners remain un@@ accoun@@ table and un@@ pun@@ ished after huge ec@@ ological disas@@ ters , what protection can we talk of ?
how can efficient civil protection be organised when public goods and services needed in critical situations , such as the fir@@ e bri@@ g@@ ade , are being trans@@ fer@@ red to private individuals or turned into repres@@ sive mechanisms ?
and then , what use is being made of even these cru@@ mb@@ s of so @-@ called &apos; res@@ t@@ itu@@ tion ?
if you want a sil@@ enc@@ ing answer , ask the victims of the 1999 ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in Greece still living in contain@@ ers .
.
I should like to congratulate Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is on his excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision amen@@ ding Dec@@ ision 1999 / 8@@ 4@@ 7 / EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
the aim is to ensure continu@@ ity in this area until a new legal instrument en@@ ters into force .
the purpose of this programme is to protect the citizens , the environment and proper@@ ty in the event of natural or man @-@ made disas@@ ters throughout the Community , by making available additional support from the other particip@@ ating countries when national response capac@@ ities are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
since this programme was adopted , we have seen its effectiveness and the need for action at European level , not least when the was ship@@ w@@ rec@@ ked and during the fi@@ res of sum@@ mer 2003 .
furthermore , the report highli@@ ghts se@@ ven areas in which the programme could be improved , most importan@@ tly those of cooperation , exchange of information and increased resources .
I should also like to express my support for increasing the annual budget for this programme to EUR 2@@ .@@ 4 million per year in 2005 and 2006 .
.
given that the Community &apos;s civil protection programme currently in force ex@@ pi@@ res on 31 December of this year , I believe that it would be entirely appropriate for the programme to be extended for two years to f@@ ill the ga@@ p between the ex@@ p@@ ir@@ y of the existing programme and the entry into force of the new instrument .
I regret , however , that the programme is to be extended without the necessary re@@ views of the period 2000 @-@ 2004 being carried out .
on the other hand , the increased funding requested by the Commission is realistic and , in the case of Portugal , particularly important .
I therefore voted in favour .
.
various disas@@ ters , such as the accident , the for@@ est fi@@ res , particularly in my country , and the f@@ loo@@ ds in the South of France have demonstrated the need for action at European level .
the scale of some disas@@ ters often over@@ wh@@ el@@ ms national response capac@@ ities .
mechanisms at European level , such as the one created by the current programme , are therefore becoming increasingly justified .
the proposal takes a step in this direction , providing for an increase of EUR 1.@@ 5 million in 2004 to EUR 2@@ .@@ 4 million per year in 2005 and 2006 .
I welcome this development , which forms part of the strength@@ ened cooperation in the area of civil protection , which the EU beg@@ an to address in the first Community A@@ ction Programme in the field of C@@ i@@ vil Pro@@ te@@ ction adopted in 1997 , the most significant development of which was the creation of the Sol@@ id@@ arity Fund for major disas@@ ters in November 2002 .
the Mon@@ itoring and In@@ for@@ mation C@@ en@@ tre is very important , as it provides Member States or third countries with some@@ where to send requests for assistance .
a permanent network of contac@@ ts has thus been set up within the Commission aimed at establishing un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted contact between the civil protection c@@ ent@@ res in the particip@@ ating countries and at promoting the exchange of information .
. the Commission &apos;s proposal is to ban the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ls in certain areas that include the se@@ amounts with the most sensitive ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts in the 200 mil@@ es around the Az@@ o@@ res , Ma@@ de@@ ira and the Can@@ ary Is@@ lands .
similar restrictions are already in place in an area of Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est S@@ cot@@ land .
I feel that we must go further , and also ban the use of bo@@ tto@@ m gi@@ ll@@ n@@ ets .
indeed , this type of net also causes serious damage to ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms , particularly in the Az@@ o@@ res exclu@@ sive economic zone , due to the vol@@ can@@ ic and ro@@ ck@@ y nature of its se@@ ab@@ ed .
various studies have confirmed the sensitive nature of de@@ ep @-@ water ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts , such as the de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef , ther@@ mal ven@@ ts and fe@@ eding grounds for fish of sea ban@@ ks and se@@ amounts .
.
I wish to offer my wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ ted support for the Commission &apos;s proposal amen@@ ding Regulation ( EC ) No 8@@ 50 / 9@@ 8 , of 30 March , as regards the protection of de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s from the effects of tra@@ w@@ ling in certain areas of the Atlan@@ tic Oc@@ ean ( COM ( 2004 ) 5@@ 8 F ) .
I appla@@ ud the Commission for tab@@ ling this proposal , because in so doing the Commission is keeping its promis@@ e to propose an amendment to the technical measures in force in the Community aimed at bann@@ ing the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ l ge@@ ar up to at least 200 mil@@ es around the ou@@ ter@@ most regions of the Az@@ o@@ res , Ma@@ de@@ ira and the Can@@ aries , with the aim of protecting ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms in some of the most sensitive areas loc@@ ated at the &apos; se@@ amounts &quot; outside 100 mil@@ es .
the de@@ ep @-@ water ha@@ b@@ ita@@ ts that the Commission &apos;s proposal is tar@@ g@@ et@@ ing were until recently protected from tra@@ w@@ ling ( use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ l or similar to@@ wed n@@ ets operating in contact with the bo@@ tto@@ m of the sea ) , due to the special access regime laid down in accession negotiations .
this regime ce@@ ased to apply in Au@@ g@@ ust 2004 , and so it was essential to guarantee the continu@@ ity of the protection of these areas as part of Community legislation .
.
the protection of the de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s in the Atlan@@ tic Oc@@ ean is , naturally , of special interest to Portugal .
the proposal is to ban the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling in the waters of the Az@@ o@@ res and Ma@@ de@@ ira , as well as in the Can@@ ary Is@@ lands , in order to protect de@@ ep @-@ water cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s , which are of enormous importance in terms of protecting bio@@ diversity .
it is estima@@ ted that 6@@ 5 % of fish species in the sea are dependent on re@@ ef@@ s at some point in their life .
in light of this need for effective protection , we are in favour of exten@@ ding the ban to bo@@ tto@@ m gi@@ ll@@ n@@ ets , which also cause serious damage to those ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms due to gh@@ ost fishing .
whilst I am not satisfied with the final result of the vote on the amendments , I wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly welcome what this report has achieved , and therefore voted in favour .
.
the proposal for a regulation before us seeks to ban the use of bo@@ tto@@ m tra@@ w@@ ling in the most environ@@ menta@@ lly sensitive areas in the first 200 sea mil@@ es around the Az@@ o@@ res , Ma@@ de@@ ira and the Can@@ ary Is@@ lands .
I broad@@ ly support the proposed measures and feel that it is vi@@ ta@@ lly important that the specific character@@ is@@ tics of each area are properly taken into account .
accord@@ ingly I also supported the amendment proposals aimed at also bann@@ ing bo@@ tto@@ m gi@@ ll@@ n@@ ets , and deep@@ ly regret that this measure was not incorpor@@ ated into the final ver@@ sion drawn up by the committee concerned , contrary to the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation .
along with various Members of this House , I have campa@@ ig@@ ned for it to be re@@ ins@@ ta@@ ted and adopted in plenary .
it is well known that this kind of net is extremely har@@ m@@ ful to ec@@ os@@ yste@@ ms , particularly given the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming prob@@ ability of gh@@ ost fishing .
in the particular case of the Az@@ o@@ res , the risk is all the greater given the vol@@ can@@ ic nature of the se@@ ab@@ ed .
it therefore made no sense only to go hal@@ f@@ way towards protection .
.
this is yet another resolution in which the Portuguese soci@@ alists ( P@@ S ) , social democ@@ rats ( P@@ S@@ D ) and pop@@ ular right ( C@@ D@@ S @-@ P@@ P ) , using language s@@ prin@@ kl@@ ed with ob@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ations and om@@ is@@ sions , re@@ aff@@ ir@@ m - together ! - their policy options and the EU &apos;s fundamental a@@ x@@ es , namely ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ alism , feder@@ alism and mili@@ tar@@ ism .
it is a package that is &apos; n@@ ic@@ ely &quot; w@@ rap@@ p@@ ed up in the language of concern for social issues and of good inten@@ tions , a package that seeks to cover up its contradic@@ tions and the true nature of the right @-@ wing policy effectively pursu@@ ed at EU level , with the de@@ vasta@@ ting impact that it has .
the P@@ S , P@@ S@@ D and C@@ D@@ S @-@ P@@ P can try all they like to def@@ lec@@ t attention from , or h@@ ide , their broad understanding , yet reality is giving the ga@@ me away .
let us keep that in mind , in Portugal , on 20 February of next year .
there are a number of sensible points of view in the motion for a resolution , but also a number of proposals that it is impossible for us members of the June Lis@@ t to vote in favour of .
in particular , we are opposed to the following four paragrap@@ h@@ s of the motion for a resolution .
paragraph 20 : &apos; the European Parliament highli@@ ghts the continuing need for action to strengthen the EU &apos;s external borders , bac@@ ked by the creation of a European cor@@ ps of border gu@@ ards . &quot;
paragraph 21 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; ur@@ ges that a European Agency for fundamental rights be established to monitor their application effectively . &quot;
last part of paragraph 33 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; ur@@ ges continued par@@ all@@ el reform of the common fisheries policy , including the creation of a European Fisheries Fund . &quot;
paragraph 40 states : &apos; &#91; Parliament &#93; believes that the Commission should draw up , as a matter of urgency , an appropriate communication and campaign strategy which pres@@ ents the new Constitution to Europe &apos;s citizens in as clear , fair and under@@ stand@@ able a way as possible . &quot;
we would note that there are various views of what an &apos; appropriate strategy &quot; is in this context .
in view of the above , we defin@@ i@@ tely cannot vote in favour of this motion for a resolution .
.
I voted in favour of the compromise motion for a resolution on the Commission &apos;s political ori@@ enta@@ tions and wish to highlight in particular the p@@ act on the economic , social and territor@@ ial cohesion policies .
as I have said on many occasions , I feel that cohesion policy is a guid@@ ing principle and the very back@@ b@@ one of the entire EU , without which the EU would lose its ra@@ is@@ on d &quot; ê@@ tre .
without cohesion policies , the EU would be no more than a &apos; hy@@ per @-@ market , &quot; an instrument of sub@@ ordin@@ ation to the big and the domin@@ ant , in all fields .
as one of the EU &apos;s foun@@ ding principles , the principle of cohesion is , moreover , a fundamenta@@ lly Christian @-@ Democ@@ ratic concept .
the L@@ ef@@ t is welcome to join us in this interpre@@ tation , but we must not leave it to the L@@ ef@@ t to advoc@@ ate and defend principles that are ours .
in other words , we must develop competitiveness , but without dama@@ ging cohesion ; rather , we must make cohesion str@@ onger .
Mr President , as a sub@@ stitu@@ te member of the Del@@ e@@ gation to EU @-@ Bulgar@@ ia J@@ o@@ int Parlia@@ mentary Committee , I want to congratulate Mr Van Or@@ den on his report and to note the very positive progress Bulgar@@ ia has made towards membership of the European Union .
we hope they will be members in a few years &apos; time .
I want to enter one ca@@ ve@@ at : there is still serious evidence about the lack of profession@@ alism of the Bulgar@@ ian judic@@ i@@ ary and of its lack of independence .
I would urge the Bulgar@@ ian Government to address those issues within the next year so that they can become members in 2007 .
, . as we have repe@@ a@@ tedly pointed out , the in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c economic and political aims of the current enlargement are there for all to see , and once again expressed in the resolution voted on just now .
the resolution g@@ los@@ ses over the fact that implementing ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al policies is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for , and a back@@ dro@@ p to , EU accession , although it does mention the de@@ i@@ fied &apos; functioning market economy , &quot; which means cap@@ ita@@ lis@@ m and the domin@@ ation and explo@@ itation of an increasingly siz@@ e@@ able por@@ tion of that country &apos;s economy by the large financial and economic groups .
it also men@@ tions &apos; direct foreign investment , &quot; which , to some people &apos;s deli@@ ght , has reached &apos; record levels , &quot; which means even greater domin@@ ation of the Bulgar@@ ian economy by the large financial groups .
appla@@ ud@@ ing Bulgar@@ ia &apos;s efforts is at vari@@ ance with the EU &apos;s much @-@ tru@@ m@@ pe@@ ted aims .
economic and social cohesion cannot be buil@@ t on the foun@@ d@@ ation of competition and the re@@ loc@@ ation of capital as a func@@ tion of increasingly un@@ br@@ id@@ led explo@@ itation .
that activity , which lea@@ ves unemployment and poverty in its wa@@ ke - as ev@@ id@@ enc@@ ed by company re@@ loc@@ ations in Portugal - does not create genuine we@@ alth in the country concerned .
the resolution itself men@@ tions that many people have not de@@ te@@ c@@ ted any improvement in their economic situation and that em@@ i@@ gration continues .
.
in common with the Commission , and with the report before us , I feel that Bulgar@@ ia has made the necessary progress towards EU accession , both at economic and at judicial level , although it should be acknowled@@ ged , among other si@@ mil@@ arly important issues , that crime , cor@@ ruption and the trafficking of human beings must be comb@@ ated more effectively .
against this back@@ dro@@ p , and given that the ongoing reforms can be achieved in time , I am in favour of the idea of Bulgar@@ ia join@@ ing the EU , depen@@ ding on &apos; own mer@@ its criteria , &quot; and therefore feel that the A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty must be concluded in 2005 so that accession can take place in January 2007 .
I therefore voted in favour .
Mr President , again I congratulate the rapporteur on his report and note with satisfac@@ tion the progress that Romania has made towards membership of the Community .
however , I enter a different ca@@ ve@@ at this time : the situation of or@@ p@@ han@@ s and young children .
the state of the hom@@ es in Romania is still unacceptable .
I would again ask the Roman@@ ian Government to address this before membership .
finally , Mr President , I thank you and your excellent staff for all the cooperation through the year , and wish you a M@@ er@@ ry Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas .
.
the report before us - following on from the previous ones - ass@@ esses progress from the perspective of the over@@ wh@@ el@@ min@@ g@@ ly ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al and cap@@ ita@@ list nature of the enlargement process .
it off@@ ers us a fair@@ ly exten@@ sive pres@@ entation of the criteria to be met and of the progress already made .
it makes critic@@ isms and off@@ ers p@@ raise in such a way that these countries end up vie@@ wing everything in terms of , and moving ever closer to , adopting and implementing a legal / institutional framework , the &apos; Community , &quot; which acts as the foun@@ d@@ ation of the EU &apos;s ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al model .
those who advoc@@ ate this policy are so keen that they have no com@@ pun@@ ction about tab@@ ling proposals that clearly attempt to sett@@ le old s@@ co@@ res with the history of the people &apos;s s@@ tru@@ gg@@ le , and so here comes , for the thou@@ san@@ d@@ th time , the ti@@ red old de@@ vo@@ tion to &apos; market econom@@ ics , &quot; &apos; structural reforms &quot; within the framework of &apos; competition &quot; and &apos; market forces , &quot; &apos; implementing the process of priva@@ tis@@ ation &quot; and &apos; dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling un@@ vi@@ able businesses &quot; and &apos; creating an at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here that is con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to business and to foreign investment . &quot;
these demands are constantly reite@@ ra@@ ted , al@@ be@@ it ac@@ compan@@ ied by hy@@ po@@ critical regret for their de@@ vasta@@ ting impact on workers and the people .
. the Dutch delegation from the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament supports the M@@ os@@ co@@ vic@@ i report , with expl@@ ic@@ it reference to the strict agreements that have been made on monitoring the progress of reforms and their application , particularly in terms of the political criteria : human rights , cor@@ ruption and the independence of the judic@@ i@@ ary .
the Dutch delegation from the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament will not hes@@ ita@@ te to call on the Commission to apply the safegu@@ ards defined in the pre @-@ accession strategy if Romania &apos;s progress gives cause to do so .
the Dutch delegation from the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament reser@@ ves the right to adopt a different position in s@@ pring when it comes to the defin@@ itive decision on Romania &apos;s accession , for instance if it should emer@@ ge that Romania &apos;s new government has not kept its promis@@ es .
that could mean ending the link between the acc@@ es@@ sions of Romania and Bulgar@@ ia .
.
in February 2004 , Parliament adopted a report that expressed regret that , despite some progress , Romania still had not completely satisfied the Copenhagen criteria .
in the mean@@ time , as we approach the end of this year , the consensus of opinion is that progress towards accession has been made , although it is recognised that there are still many areas in which this objective has yet to be met in full .
it therefore makes complete sense for us to seek to negoti@@ ate the terms of the Treaty in 2005 and that a safeguard clause be ins@@ er@@ ted in case Romania &apos;s accession has to be post@@ pon@@ ed until January 200@@ 8 , which does , indeed , appear prob@@ able .
consequently , I voted in favour of the report .
.
I should like Romania to be in a position to conclude negotiations as soon as possible , with a view to sig@@ ning the EU A@@ cc@@ ession Treaty .
I welcome the rapporteur &apos;s recommendations and war@@ n@@ ings .
it is important that the Roman@@ ian authorities and the Roman@@ ian people are aware of the potential stu@@ mb@@ ling b@@ loc@@ ks of the accession process .
let me point out , in particular , that safeguard c@@ laus@@ es can be implemented in the event that Romania fall@@ s well short of meeting conditions and that accession can be post@@ pon@@ ed for one year if the is not being implemented and the Copenhagen political criteria are not being compli@@ ed with .
I feel , however , that such war@@ n@@ ings make no sense unless they serve to encourage good behaviour and good per@@ for@@ man@@ ce and never to set im@@ pos@@ sibly high th@@ res@@ hol@@ ds .
I particularly agree with the rapporteur &apos;s idea that the Commission must create a permanent mechanism to closely monitor and assis@@ t Romania on this road and the Commission must , in my view , continue to provide Parliament with detailed information on how the country is prog@@ res@@ sing towards accession .
the adoption of this report is particularly ti@@ mely , following the way in which the presid@@ ential elections were conduc@@ ted in Romania last S@@ un@@ day .
that conclu@@ des the explan@@ ations of vote .
I should like to welcome the delegation from the Assembly of the Kingdom of Sa@@ ud@@ i Ara@@ bia , cha@@ i@@ red by Mr Z@@ aid b@@ in A@@ l @-@ M@@ uh@@ s@@ in A@@ l @-@ Hussein .
the importance we atta@@ ch to this visit , which is the first to the Chamber of the European Parliament since 1995 , should be emphas@@ ised .
this visit comes at a very significant moment , especially in view of the fact that Sa@@ ud@@ i Ara@@ bia will be holding its first local elections in February 2005 .
this visit constitu@@ tes a new stage in the deep@@ ening of relations between the Sa@@ ud@@ i people and the European Union .
Mr President , we are very pleased about the holding of local elections in Sa@@ ud@@ i Ara@@ bia , but very much de@@ pl@@ or@@ e the lack of participation by women .
I dec@@ l@@ are the sitting resu@@ med .
the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distribu@@ ted .
are there any comments ?
just two brief points , Mr President , the first of which has to do with the vote on Turkey .
during the vote on Turkey - on the Eur@@ l@@ ings report - I voted in favour of Mr L@@ ang@@ en &apos;s Amendment No 16 .
that has not , however , been recor@@ ded ; perhaps the ma@@ ch@@ ine was not working .
I would ask you to correct that .
secondly , we voted yesterday on the EU @-@ Russia summit .
in so doing , we said that all sectors of Chech@@ en society should be integrated into the peace process .
I have lear@@ ned today that the family of President M@@ as@@ k@@ ha@@ do@@ v , whose election took place under O@@ S@@ C@@ E super@@ vision , has been ab@@ duc@@ ted and inter@@ ned by the Russian sec@@ ret services .
they include his si@@ b@@ l@@ ings , who are between 6@@ 9 and 75 years of age .
I would ask that you have this information ver@@ i@@ fied and , if it prov@@ es to be acc@@ ura@@ te , prote@@ st to the Russian authorities about this .
your comments have been noted , Mr Pos@@ sel@@ t .
if there are no further comments , the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes are approved .
the next item is the debate on se@@ ven mo@@ tions for resolutions on Zimbabwe .
Mr President , Zimbabwe is a land of trag@@ edy and a land of ty@@ rann@@ y .
it is a country rich in natural resources and rich in the resources of its people .
both are being de@@ vasta@@ ted by the political ty@@ rann@@ y of the Mu@@ ga@@ be regime .
people are suffering from hun@@ ger and health problems as a result of food and me@@ dical aid being with@@ held from areas that are covered by the opposition parties .
some 9 million people , 75 % of the Zimbab@@ we@@ an population , are now said to be living bel@@ ow the poverty line , but the World Fo@@ od Programme is only able to provide food for 1.@@ 6 million people this December .
that is the first reason why this is an urgency .
the second reason is that on 3 March there is sup@@ posed to be an election in Zimbabwe .
that election , on the present pros@@ pects , will be neither free nor fair .
it is not up to us to decide who the people of Zimbabwe should elec@@ t .
that is entirely for them , but they must be free to elec@@ t wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever they wish .
it is up to the neighbour@@ ing countries of Africa and to the African Union to make sure that international standards of democracy per@@ tain throughout Africa and throughout the country of Zimbabwe .
it is up to the European Union to make sure that we support the monitoring of those elections , giving technical support and financial support , so that we can play our part in the international obser@@ ver mis@@ sions .
that is also why it is an urgency today .
the third reason is the in@@ toler@@ able attack on the liber@@ ty of Ro@@ y B@@ enn@@ et@@ t , one of their members of parliament , a man who has suffer@@ ed , whose family has suffer@@ ed and whose workers have suffer@@ ed over the months .
Mr B@@ enn@@ et@@ t pus@@ hed a government minis@@ ter because he was making ra@@ cial remarks about Mr B@@ enn@@ et@@ t and his family .
he was then sent to pris@@ on , not by the cour@@ ts , but by a vote in the parliament based on the political div@@ ision .
I urge that the A@@ U and the EU act today to bring a s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe .
Mr President , I have just re@@ turned from a private visit to Zimbabwe .
it is interesting to note that the situation on the ground does not appear des@@ per@@ ate .
however , according to the statistics , the situation is probably worse in other parts of the country which I did not visit .
when deb@@ ating such countries as Zimbabwe , where human rights are not even discussed because of fear of repres@@ sion , we must consider the right attitude to take in order to try to influence the powers that be .
we know we are dealing with a regime that is not democratic , that has taken tried to use almost all its powers to take away the democratic and fundamental rights of part of its population .
on the other hand , we have seen recently that there is a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing .
the cour@@ ts , for instance , are s@@ tri@@ ving from a very difficult position to try to re@@ tain some form of im@@ parti@@ ality .
sometimes I wonder whether a car@@ ro@@ t @-@ and @-@ s@@ tic@@ k policy might be more appropriate and more fru@@ it@@ ful than just pass@@ ing mo@@ tions of condem@@ nation .
we may pass this motion but what effect will it have ?
very little , I think , with a regime like Mu@@ ga@@ be &apos;s .
we must start to think in different terms if we are to be effective when dealing with a regime of this sort .
Mr President , political op@@ pression in Zimbabwe c@@ as@@ ts a long sha@@ dow ; it is a cl@@ ou@@ d that lies over not only those living in Zimbabwe itself but also those who have left to seek asylum in Europe .
in my constitu@@ ency in the nor@@ th @-@ e@@ ast of Eng@@ land , there are Zimbab@@ we@@ ans who fear sum@@ mar@@ y death if they are forced to return to their na@@ tive land .
I hope that Member State governments like my own , which think it is safe for asylum @-@ see@@ kers to be re@@ turned to Zimbabwe , will take note of the resolution tabled here this afternoon and revis@@ e their position .
the situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse , not better .
on 9 December 2004 , the N@@ on @-@ Govern@@ mental Or@@ gan@@ is@@ ations A@@ c@@ t came into force .
this A@@ c@@ t b@@ ans foreign human rights organisations and gives the government powers to interven@@ e in the operations of any NG@@ O in Zimbabwe .
mean@@ while , the quality of life for Zimbab@@ we@@ ans has plu@@ m@@ me@@ ted .
life expec@@ tan@@ cy is now 35 years .
Zimbabwe could be self @-@ sufficient in food , but last se@@ as@@ on it produced only a third of the ma@@ iz@@ e it needs ; yet the Mu@@ ga@@ be regime is inter@@ fer@@ ing with the international distribution of food .
in the light of this de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating situation , it is high time to ti@@ gh@@ ten up tar@@ ge@@ ted sanctions against the regime .
a final point : as we have heard , next March Zimbabwe is due to hold a general election .
there are wor@@ rying indic@@ ations that this election may not be held in free and fair conditions .
elector@@ al legislation passed earlier this month did not meet international democratic standards .
good obser@@ vation of the elections is going to be a vital part of ensuring that they are free and fair .
therefore I hope that we in Parliament , and the Council and the Commission , will provide the maximum possible support for election @-@ obser@@ ver mis@@ sions at all levels .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Zimbabwe has always experienc@@ ed perio@@ ds of comple@@ x@@ ity and prof@@ ound div@@ ision , whether under c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ alism , at the time of I@@ an S@@ mit@@ h &apos;s Uni@@ la@@ teral Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depend@@ ence in 19@@ 6@@ 5 and the en@@ su@@ ing UN embar@@ go , during the war of liber@@ ation from 197@@ 2 to 197@@ 8 and then , following independence , in the first democratic elections , which were w@@ on by Z@@ A@@ N@@ U under R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Mu@@ ga@@ be .
for me , though , as an East German , it is always strik@@ ing how often leaders who take office full of lo@@ f@@ ty ide@@ als then , so to speak , dis@@ tance themselves from their own original goals and v@@ isions and take less and less account of the people &apos;s interests the longer they are in power .
Zimbabwe does , of course , even today have mas@@ sive problems to con@@ ten@@ d with .
I believe that the only thing we can recommen@@ d to Zimbab@@ we@@ ans today is to look around them and see how their neighbours have managed it - to look at what South Africa is doing , at what Na@@ mi@@ bia is doing , at how Angol@@ a and Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que are trying to establish a balance between the various ves@@ ted interests in their countries .
if there is to be peace , there must be an attempt at mutual understanding , with the use of peaceful means and every interest , even the most di@@ ver@@ se , taken into account .
Zimbabwe needs land reform , but there are other ways of going about it .
the European Union should not always be , as it were , making recommendations to all and su@@ n@@ d@@ ry on the basis of our values .
very often , that goes wrong ; perhaps you all still rec@@ all the European Union &apos;s sta@@ un@@ ch support for Russia &apos;s President Y@@ el@@ t@@ s@@ in at a time when he was an al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic .
in this actual instance , we can be conf@@ ident that the SA@@ D@@ C will have influence and find opportunities , and that the African Union can act to move things forward .
I am convinced that we , if we support these countries in their efforts to influence Zimbabwe , will be very likely to be able to help the elections sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for March to be fair and democratic after all .
- Mr President , the Mu@@ ga@@ be regime &apos;s strategy of for@@ cing political op@@ pon@@ ents into line is continuing un@@ ab@@ ated .
for example , the Zimbab@@ we@@ an authorities have forced two new@@ s@@ paper@@ s expres@@ sing critical views to close in the past 18 months .
in addition , Mu@@ ga@@ be &apos;s suppor@@ ters have made , and continue to make , life as difficult as possible for the opposition party , the Mo@@ vement for Democ@@ ratic C@@ han@@ ge .
un@@ doub@@ tedly with a view to the appro@@ ac@@ hing parliamentary elections in March 2005 , the Mu@@ ga@@ be regime is increasing the pressure on independent organisations , jud@@ ging by the N@@ on @-@ governmental Or@@ gan@@ is@@ ations A@@ c@@ t adopted in Har@@ are exactly a week ago .
in future , these shall no longer be per@@ mitted to receive any funding from ab@@ road .
if a Zimbab@@ we@@ an civil liber@@ ties or human rights organisation has so much as one foreign employe@@ e on its staff , it is h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th ter@@ med foreign .
pursu@@ ant to the new A@@ c@@ t , foreign NGOs cannot be regis@@ tered and will therefore be bann@@ ed in the ne@@ ar future .
the aim of this new legislation is clear .
after all , numerous Zimbab@@ we@@ an civil liber@@ ties and human rights organisations rely on foreign don@@ ations .
it is obvious that the intention of the Zimbab@@ we@@ an Government is to sil@@ ence them .
according to reports , the NGOs concerned are un@@ willing to sub@@ mit to the Government &apos;s attempt to ga@@ g them .
that is an extremely coura@@ ge@@ ous attitude .
the Council and the Commission will have their work cut out to advis@@ e and assis@@ t them in this .
. - Mr President , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , ladies and gentlemen , Zimbabwe is unfortunately one of the to@@ pic@@ s that fig@@ ure most reg@@ ularly , most frequ@@ ently , in these Th@@ urs@@ day debates that we hold on pres@@ sing human rights problems .
this tell@@ s us two things : firstly , that the situation remains serious and , secondly , that the measures that we have adopted have not been working .
what we must first condemn is the destruction of a country by an app@@ all@@ ing author@@ ita@@ rian regime .
as has been mentioned in this House , the poverty statistics are increasingly sho@@ cking ; Zimbabwe used to be a country that , if properly managed , could not only have f@@ ed its entire population , but could also have help@@ ed to solve the problems of hun@@ ger and need on the African continent and in other parts of the world .
the Mu@@ ga@@ be regime , however , despite war@@ n@@ ings from the EU and from further a@@ field , continues to increase political op@@ pression and we view the elections sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for March with great concern .
either the country under@@ goes a rapid trans@@ for@@ mation and off@@ ers even the sli@@ gh@@ test opportunity for debate or those elections will not be free and fair and one doub@@ ts whether it will even be worth obser@@ ving them .
such is the case of Ro@@ y B@@ enn@@ ette , of per@@ secu@@ tion per@@ pet@@ ra@@ ted against T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i after his visit to this House , of the negative influence - and I wish to draw your attention to this - that the regime can have in the region , where reg@@ imes can choose to follow the path of democracy or to sli@@ p back into author@@ ita@@ ri@@ an@@ ism .
I was recently in Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que , for example , where elections have been taking place .
the coun@@ t has yet to be comple@@ ted .
we bec@@ a@@ me aware , however , that during the election campaign Mo@@ z@@ amb@@ ic@@ an vo@@ ters voted ab@@ road and that opposition parties - those opposed to F@@ R@@ EL@@ I@@ M@@ O - were per@@ secu@@ ted in Zimbabwe .
the conditions are in place , however .
Zimbabwe &apos;s des@@ tin@@ y can decisi@@ vely contribute towards consolid@@ ating the democracy that we hope for in the region , following the example of South Africa , thereby consolid@@ ating democratic as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions in Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que and Angol@@ a .
it may , on the other hand , represent a step back@@ wards into forms of author@@ ita@@ ri@@ an@@ ism .
I wish to point out that we have put increasing pressure on neighbour@@ ing countries and that we have developed dialogue with the African Union .
this demonstra@@ tes the important role that that organisation has to play in exer@@ ting its form of pressure on Mu@@ ga@@ be &apos;s app@@ all@@ ing regime .
. - Mr President , the Zimbab@@ we@@ ans are a strong people , and Zimbabwe is a strong country .
following independence , it was also an econom@@ ically promis@@ ing country .
it is sa@@ d to see that around 60 % of the population is currently in financial crisis and frequ@@ ently lives bel@@ ow the poverty line .
that clearly says something about the administration of the country and what has gradu@@ ally gone wrong with it .
the sa@@ d thing is that Mu@@ ga@@ be and the Z@@ A@@ N@@ U @-@ P@@ F party , particularly Mu@@ ga@@ be &apos;s inn@@ er cir@@ cle , are the per@@ pet@@ ra@@ tors .
there are many in the Z@@ A@@ N@@ U @-@ P@@ F party , of course , who are very well aware of the need for outside help , of the need for the economy to develop in a different direction , if the country is to sur@@ vi@@ ve .
we know that neighbour@@ ing countries have produced many infor@@ mal contac@@ ts and endeav@@ ours to achieve a solution , and I think that it is precisely with these that the opportunities for the European Union li@@ e .
with the support of the African Union , the New Par@@ t@@ nership for Africa &apos;s Development ( N@@ E@@ P@@ A@@ D ) , President M@@ be@@ ki and all the other contac@@ ts , we must increase the pressure , because it is only via the African rou@@ te and the European Union &apos;s connection with this that we stand a chance of achieving any kind of result .
there is no doubt that the March elections have largely fall@@ en into and been s@@ hap@@ ed by the wrong hands already , and it will be very difficult to make them fair and open .
this ren@@ ders obser@@ vation close to poin@@ t@@ less .
nevertheless , it is in that democratic process and in civil society that streng@@ th is to be found .
that streng@@ th is still great in Zimbabwe , still non @-@ viol@@ ent and still ori@@ ented towards peace and democratic solutions .
I hope that , by using s@@ mar@@ t sanctions , by taking the path that we , the European Union , are taking , and in consultation with those other countries , we shall do our ut@@ most to take that democratic step there .
the alternative path , b@@ loo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed , off@@ ers no pros@@ pects .
I sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that we can use all our diplom@@ atic means to increase the pressure to such a degree that Mu@@ ga@@ be is sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by people who set the dom@@ ino@@ es fall@@ ing .
this is necessary if the democratic path is to stand a chance of success there .
indeed , it is my hope that Europe will make full use of all the means at its dispos@@ al to this end .
. - Mr President , a leg@@ acy of c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial S@@ ou@@ thern R@@ ho@@ des@@ ia is that much of the Zimbab@@ we@@ an farm@@ land is in the hands of a small group of farmers of European origin .
my group supports the wishes of the b@@ lack majority of the population for the return of most of the land to them .
unfortunately , that wish is being seriously ab@@ used by R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Mu@@ ga@@ be , the man once pop@@ ular as the lead@@ er of the successful war of liber@@ ation against the c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial occu@@ pi@@ ers and the rac@@ ist minority Government of I@@ an S@@ mit@@ h .
it was not until the elector@@ ate had almost lost its trust in him that he made the long @-@ promis@@ ed land reform a priority .
for Mu@@ ga@@ be , the ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation of large f@@ arms is now princi@@ p@@ ally an instrument to re@@ ward his old following of freedom fi@@ gh@@ ters at last after dec@@ ad@@ es of delay .
still more , it forms part of a campaign to elimin@@ ate political op@@ pon@@ ents by means of s@@ l@@ urs , inti@@ mid@@ ation and co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
if Europe is@@ ol@@ ates this regime , it must do so not on the basis of old c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial interests and old c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce , but because we want to help every country in the world promote human rights and democracy .
that is what this is all about .
- E@@ very nation has the right and responsibility to resolve its political problems and no @-@ one , let alone the European Union , Bri@@ tain or the United States of America , has the cre@@ d@@ enti@@ als to interven@@ e politically , econom@@ ically or mili@@ tar@@ ily either in Zimbabwe or in any other country .
it is precisely because the people of Zimbabwe managed , through huge , b@@ loo@@ dy b@@ att@@ les , to gain their independence from Bri@@ tain and because they are claim@@ ing their land , the ric@@ h@@ est part of which still bel@@ ong@@ s to fore@@ ig@@ ners - mainly Br@@ it@@ ons - as a result of c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ alism , that a new plan of intervention is being prepared , the aim of which is to turn Zimbabwe into a modern c@@ ol@@ on@@ y .
on the pre@@ text of any problems which exist , most of which are due to long @-@ term dela@@ ys as a result of c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ alism , the governments of Bri@@ tain and other countries are ban@@ k@@ ro@@ lling the opposition , the lead@@ er of which , it should be noted , is acc@@ used of the attemp@@ ted mur@@ der of the elected presid@@ ent .
a network of so @-@ called &apos; non @-@ governmental organisations &apos; is being set up , most of which are fron@@ t organisations which have nothing to do with the g@@ ras@@ s @-@ ro@@ ots and social movement ; they are there to prepare the ground for intervention .
for the Commun@@ ist Party of Greece , this motion is unacceptable ; even the acc@@ us@@ ation of arms trading by British ag@@ ents has been with@@ drawn .
the sanctions must stop .
we need to support the people of Zimbabwe in their fight to maintain their independence from ne@@ o @-@ c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ alism .
. Mr President , we in the Commission understand and take a very serious view of the prepar@@ ations for the elections in March 2005 .
the Commission reite@@ rates its atta@@ ch@@ ment to the holding of free and fair elections in that country .
the recent introduction by the government of Zimbabwe of a set of elector@@ al reforms which are currently under discussion in the Zimbab@@ we@@ an parliament is an important step .
it will have to be assess@@ ed whether this will lead to a genuine incorpor@@ ation into domestic elector@@ al legislation of the S@@ ou@@ thern African Development Community ( SA@@ D@@ C ) principles and guidelines govern@@ ing democratic elections , as unanim@@ ously agreed in the SA@@ D@@ C Summit in Ma@@ ur@@ iti@@ us last Au@@ g@@ ust .
the Commission remains deep@@ ly concerned about the current political and human rights situation and the respect for fundamental freedoms which at this stage would har@@ dly allow for free and fair elections .
a specific matter of concern is the approval by the Zimbab@@ we@@ an parliament , on 9 December , of the NG@@ O B@@ ill , which he@@ a@@ vil@@ y restric@@ ts NGOs &apos; room for action and activities .
the Commission fully supports the proposed EU in Har@@ are and other SA@@ D@@ C cap@@ i@@ tal@@ s as well as the issu@@ ing of an EU declaration expres@@ sing concerns regarding the implications of the b@@ ill .
the Commission is also wor@@ ried about the risk of politic@@ isation of the distribution of food aid , mainly in the context of the up@@ coming parliamentary elections .
in the event of clear ver@@ i@@ fication of par@@ tis@@ an use , the Commission , together with its partners , including the W@@ F@@ P , may have to en@@ vis@@ age suspen@@ ding food aid operations .
after the March elections the Commission will reas@@ s@@ ess the situation .
any lif@@ ting or eas@@ ing of EU measures against Zimbabwe cannot be justified at this stage .
the Commission is aware of the deliber@@ ate attemp@@ ts by the Zimbab@@ we@@ an authorities to undermin@@ e the vis@@ a ban &apos;s credibility by multi@@ pl@@ ying their tra@@ vel@@ s to Europe and has always advoc@@ ated a strict application of the exemp@@ tions provided for in the Council common position of 19 February 2004 .
the Commission will continue to expl@@ or@@ e all a@@ ven@@ ues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and to pursue an enhan@@ ced political dialogue with neighbour@@ ing SA@@ D@@ C countries , no@@ tably South Africa .
continued international pressure on Zimbabwe and especially regional pe@@ er pressure is necessary .
the vote will take place this afternoon , after the debates .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the debate on six mo@@ tions for resolutions on the situation in the e@@ ast of the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o .
Mr President , compar@@ is@@ ons can be drawn between C@@ ong@@ o &apos;s present situation and that of Germany during the Th@@ ir@@ ty Y@@ e@@ ars &quot; W@@ ar - a large country in the m@@ iddle of a continent bro@@ ken up , with various groups all@@ ying themselves with an ass@@ or@@ tment of neighbour@@ ing powers , and dec@@ ad@@ es without peace .
that is precisely what has been going on in C@@ ong@@ o for dec@@ ad@@ es , with people d@@ ying in their millions , vas@@ t st@@ ret@@ ches of land lying waste , and the economy cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed .
as was the case in the after@@ ma@@ th of the Th@@ ir@@ ty Y@@ e@@ ars &quot; W@@ ar , there will be no resolution unless - as happened with the religious groups then - the eth@@ nic groups can be brought into a peace process that also involves all the neighbour@@ ing states .
that is why we see it as important that mas@@ sive pressure should be brought to bear on the states bor@@ der@@ ing this country of great la@@ kes , and especially on R@@ wan@@ da , in order that it may bring stability once and for all and may be de@@ ter@@ red from active intervention in C@@ ong@@ o , which is already suffering so much .
we will not , however , succeed in that by words alone , and so Mr L@@ ang@@ en and I have started to develop a hol@@ is@@ tic strategy which finally inter@@ lin@@ ks economic policy , foreign policy and development policy .
words alone will be no use to us in this situation ; Europe will be able to use its w@@ eight only if it makes si@@ mul@@ ta@@ ne@@ ous and strategic use of the economic , political and diplom@@ atic options available to it and really gets actively involved in this peace process .
Commissioner , you might well ask y@@ our@@ self what the use is of having this debate on a Th@@ urs@@ day afternoon in a Chamber that is not exactly full .
I can remember a time when this House deb@@ ated how Li@@ thu@@ ania could become more than a c@@ ol@@ on@@ y subject to So@@ vi@@ et op@@ pression , and today we have a Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian Commissioner in our mid@@ st .
of that I am glad , and I am sure that you are well able to han@@ dle this issue of peace and human rights in C@@ ong@@ o .
Mr President , the conflict in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of the C@@ ong@@ o is the most le@@ th@@ al since the Sec@@ ond World W@@ ar .
the International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee rec@@ k@@ ons that 3@@ .@@ 8 million people have now been ki@@ lled and over a million of those are children .
apart from those ki@@ lled , 3@@ .@@ 4 million have been dis@@ placed .
C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese and foreign military groups continue to use violence to conc@@ e@@ al the pl@@ under@@ ing of g@@ old , ti@@ mber , iv@@ ory , tin and other natural resources .
mean@@ while , the fra@@ g@@ ile and ine@@ ffec@@ tual trans@@ itional C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese government stu@@ mb@@ les from political s@@ tal@@ em@@ ate to military crisis .
both the trans@@ itional government and its international partners have failed to deal with the ro@@ ot causes of the conflict .
natural res@@ ource explo@@ itation has fun@@ ded and fu@@ ell@@ ed the ins@@ tability in the country and , indeed , has fu@@ ell@@ ed ins@@ tability and violence in the C@@ ong@@ o for over a hun@@ d@@ red years .
what should have been a b@@ less@@ ing to that country has turned out to be a source of de@@ ep sa@@ d@@ ness and regret and , indeed , a cur@@ se .
the C@@ ong@@ o &apos;s natural we@@ alth has been a source of private funding for military and political el@@ ite@@ s instead of benef@@ iting the vas@@ t majority of the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese population .
our resolution rightly calls for a package of measures to tackle this situation .
we must take action to ensure respect for the arms embar@@ go ; the UN Security Council must impose sanctions , travel restrictions , a ban on financial services , et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a , on individuals who have partici@@ pa@@ ted in the pill@@ ag@@ ing of C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese ass@@ ets ; the EU and its Member States must act against companies involved in explo@@ itation ; we need a peace@@ keeping force in the e@@ ast of the country ; and action must be taken to dis@@ arm all ille@@ g@@ ally armed groups .
only if such measures are taken can we hold out any hope that the elections due next year will make any difference to the tragic situation in that country .
the problem in the C@@ ong@@ o is neither eth@@ nic nor ra@@ cial .
it is about econom@@ ics , and only if we tackle econom@@ ics will we solve the problems .
Mr President , I speak in place of Mr Van H@@ ec@@ ke , who has had to leave Strasbourg early as he is tra@@ ve@@ lling to the Democ@@ ratic Republic of the C@@ ong@@ o tomorrow .
the current situation in eas@@ tern C@@ ong@@ o shows that the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese peace process is still very fra@@ g@@ ile .
indeed , there have been reports of new ex@@ changes of fir@@ e yesterday .
the AL@@ DE Group warm@@ ly welcomed the initiative to draft an urgency resolution on the C@@ ong@@ o .
ultimately , however , our group decided not to endorse the compromise resolution .
we feel that the compromise text fail@@ s to identi@@ fy the cor@@ e problem of the continuing ins@@ tability in the region and of the difficult relationship between the Democ@@ ratic Republic of the C@@ ong@@ o and its neighbour@@ ing countries , especially R@@ wan@@ da .
the issue is this : since the end of the R@@ wan@@ d@@ an gen@@ oc@@ ide in 199@@ 4 a large group of extre@@ mis@@ t H@@ u@@ tu@@ s have been hid@@ ing in a remo@@ te area of the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese ra@@ infor@@ est in the e@@ ast of the C@@ ong@@ o .
after all these years they have still not been dis@@ armed .
the presence of these he@@ a@@ vil@@ y armed mil@@ iti@@ as is a constan@@ t threat to the peace process in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of the C@@ ong@@ o and to security in the entire Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es region .
the mas@@ sa@@ cr@@ e at the Bur@@ un@@ di@@ an refuge@@ e cam@@ p of G@@ atu@@ mb@@ a last Au@@ g@@ ust was only one in a long series of pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive actions .
MO@@ N@@ U@@ C , the UN Pe@@ ace@@ keeping M@@ is@@ sion in the C@@ ong@@ o , was sup@@ posed to dis@@ arm and neu@@ tr@@ alise the re@@ bel@@ s , but has failed to do so .
although MO@@ N@@ U@@ C &apos;s mandate has been strength@@ ened and there are ex@@ tra tro@@ op@@ s , they are poor@@ ly tra@@ ined and there is a serious lack of information and technical assistance .
we feel that the joint resolution does not acknowledge that if R@@ wan@@ da is c@@ ros@@ sing the border into the C@@ ong@@ o to put an end to the activity of the armed gan@@ gs , it is happening in the context of MO@@ N@@ U@@ C having failed to do the dis@@ arm@@ ing .
we would suggest that the European Union and the Member States need to get more actively involved in the D@@ R@@ C and the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es region , foc@@ using very much on rapid dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment of the re@@ be@@ l forces .
perhaps European tro@@ op@@ s could be used to strengthen the UN peace@@ keeping forces .
the tro@@ op@@ s from Pakistan , N@@ ep@@ al , U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay and other countries that are in the C@@ ong@@ o at the moment simply do not have enough experience with military operations in su@@ b @-@ Sa@@ har@@ an Africa .
Europe has that experience .
we have to consider all the options in order to make dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment happen .
it is by far the most important pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite to get the peace process back on tra@@ ck .
in sum@@ mar@@ y , we feel that although the resolution has many points that we support , it is un@@ balanced .
so , with regret , I will ab@@ sta@@ in .
Mr President , my Group wel@@ comes the opportunity to discuss the current situation in the D@@ R@@ C , but like others deep@@ ly regre@@ ts the need to come back to this .
in the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday , one of the things we agreed was that the European Union &apos;s common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention , pa@@ ying special attention to long @-@ term conflict situations .
this is exactly what we have in the D@@ R@@ C where , as has already been pointed out , the desire to control natural resources pla@@ ys an absolutely key role in the mas@@ sive dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ements of people and in the mas@@ sive nu@@ mb@@ ers of de@@ a@@ ths .
we stress the need for an effective means of arms control and an effective dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment programme to be put in place .
we would also endorse the call made for the UN to deal with those prof@@ ite@@ ering from the pill@@ age of natural resources , not least through the fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing of ban@@ k accounts and actions against companies .
we feel perfectly able to do this in the case of what we believe to be terrorist organisations , but seem totally inc@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of doing it with those who cause mas@@ sive nu@@ mb@@ ers of de@@ a@@ ths elsewhere in the world .
we also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN D@@ e@@ part@@ ment of Pe@@ ace @-@ K@@ e@@ eping O@@ per@@ ations has set up a special investi@@ ga@@ tive te@@ am to look at the cases of sexual abuse and explo@@ itation per@@ pet@@ ra@@ ted by some of its own members in the UN organis@@ ing mission in the D@@ R@@ C , particularly in B@@ uni@@ a .
we know , since this Parliament has discussed it on many occasions , that ra@@ pe is used as a means to dem@@ or@@ alise op@@ pon@@ ents by demonstra@@ ting the people cannot even protect their own families .
this Parliament has recognised on many occasions that victims of ra@@ pe , child victims of se@@ x abuse , are particularly v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able .
so we consider it des@@ pic@@ able that such crimes are also being committed by those sent to protect an already tra@@ u@@ mat@@ ised population .
we look for the per@@ pet@@ ra@@ tors to be brought to justice , as well as those prof@@ ite@@ ering from the trag@@ edy in the D@@ R@@ C .
. - Mr President , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , ladies and gentlemen , the situation in the Gre@@ at L@@ ak@@ es and in particular in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o , is an ul@@ c@@ er , a vol@@ can@@ o in the heart of Africa that is , sa@@ dly , always li@@ able to er@@ up@@ t .
following a conflict that , during its six years , claim@@ ed three million lives , but that continues to claim 3@@ 1.@@ 000 lives every month , according to the International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee , the sig@@ ns are that the situation remains un@@ stable and unfortunately extremely un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table .
the ACP @-@ EU joint parliamentary ass@@ embly recently met in The H@@ ag@@ ue .
our meeting open@@ ed , cu@@ ri@@ ously , with the good ne@@ ws of the D@@ ar @-@ es @-@ S@@ al@@ am Conference and of the commitment made there by all Heads of Government to end the conflict .
by Th@@ urs@@ day , however , when we en@@ ded the meeting , our joint Cha@@ irman , G@@ len@@ ys K@@ inno@@ ck , had brought us the sa@@ d ne@@ ws that the R@@ wan@@ d@@ an ar@@ my had c@@ ros@@ sed the border into the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o .
we must therefore be more effective in this area in order to sta@@ bil@@ ise the region .
Mr Pos@@ sel@@ t &apos;s compar@@ is@@ on with the Th@@ ir@@ ty Y@@ e@@ ars &quot; W@@ ar was most ap@@ t and I hope that he is right , because if so the conflict will come to an end and those regions of the African continent will be as prosper@@ ous , stable and modern as Germany is today .
this is what we s@@ tri@@ ve for .
the African continent must be sta@@ bil@@ ised in open and democratic soci@@ eties .
what must we do in this House ?
we must acknowledge that we are not doing enough as regards the mil@@ iti@@ as of the former government of R@@ wan@@ da .
they are a source of ins@@ tability and an exc@@ use for permanent ins@@ tability in the e@@ ast of the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o and we must take str@@ onger action to dis@@ arm them .
we must make it clear that any in@@ va@@ sion is unacceptable and that respect for a country &apos;s borders is a principle that must be applied by all countries in the region .
we must complete the democratic trans@@ for@@ mation of the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o and do what we can to sta@@ bil@@ ise the country ; the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese ar@@ my must be re@@ uni@@ fied , for example .
we must strengthen the resources available to the United Nations &quot; mission in order to guarantee genuine peace and stability in the e@@ ast of the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o and to succeed in creating conditions on the ground that do not take us back@@ wards ; in other words , conditions that lead all sides to hon@@ our the 2003 peace agreements , that lead all sides to hon@@ our agreements undertaken in T@@ an@@ z@@ ania on 20 November of this year and that lead all sides du@@ ly to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions .
. amongst the many examples of viol@@ ation of human rights and democratic principles in Africa , the involvement of children in armed conflicts stands out as an extremely serious problem .
I wonder whether any debate , even one held in this House , can help to counter poverty in developing countries .
over 5 billion people in such countries live on one or two doll@@ ars a day , and a b@@ loo@@ dy children &apos;s war is being f@@ ought in C@@ ong@@ o , where over 3@@ 00@@ .000 children are fighting in military interven@@ tions which have ki@@ lled more than 3 million people in recent years .
does such destruction of chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od through en@@ forced labour , rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment to the armed forces and sexual explo@@ itation not demonstrate lack of responsibility and failure on the part of the various humanitarian and international organisations ?
in order to take measures to prevent tra@@ ge@@ dies of this kind , it is necessary to begin by identi@@ fying their causes .
the most fundamental of these is the long @-@ term and wide @-@ ran@@ ging explo@@ itation of developing countries by a number of world powers , including European countries .
the latter prof@@ it from such explo@@ itation while the loo@@ ted c@@ ol@@ on@@ ies are left even po@@ ore@@ r .
C@@ ong@@ o is de@@ vasta@@ ted , having become the victi@@ m of explo@@ i@@ ters for whom the country &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant natural resources are more important than human lives .
I believe that a person &apos;s level of civil@@ isation should be measu@@ red in terms of how responsible their attitude is to the wea@@ kes@@ t , and the same is true for those in power .
yet the wea@@ kes@@ t among us should not be provided with aid that is merely a sha@@ m , and takes the form of mor@@ al de@@ vasta@@ tion , contrac@@ ep@@ tion and abor@@ tion .
much more is needed .
comprehensive care should be provided , and development facilita@@ ted .
in addition , mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ o@@ sis and A@@ ID@@ S , which are pre@@ val@@ ent in the country , should be treated , and family un@@ its help@@ ed to develop s@@ oun@@ dly .
I also believe that instead of sen@@ ding armed forces and ins@@ truc@@ tors to Iraq , we should take steps to ensure that peace finally pre@@ va@@ ils in C@@ ong@@ o .
. Mr President , the European Commission shar@@ es the concerns of Parliament about the increasing ten@@ sions between R@@ wan@@ da and the Democ@@ ratic Republic of C@@ ong@@ o and their consequences for the human rights situation in the region .
indeed , we are very concerned by the thre@@ ats of R@@ wan@@ da to use force against the territor@@ ial inte@@ gr@@ ity of the C@@ ong@@ o in order to neu@@ tr@@ alise the e@@ x @-@ F@@ A@@ R and I@@ nte@@ ra@@ ha@@ m@@ we tro@@ op@@ s , and by the multi@@ ple reports of military operations by the R@@ wan@@ d@@ an ar@@ my in the eas@@ tern C@@ ong@@ o .
the humanitarian crisis that these actions gener@@ ate is an additional reason for our concern .
it is essential to the stability of the region that R@@ wan@@ da with@@ dra@@ ws without delay any forces it may have in the territory of the D@@ R@@ C , and re@@ fra@@ in from any action or statement that contra@@ ven@@ es international law .
the European Commission is deep@@ ly convinced that until the problem of the presence of e@@ x @-@ F@@ A@@ R elements in the eas@@ tern D@@ R@@ C is defin@@ iti@@ vely sol@@ ved , it will undermin@@ e peace and security in the region , be a source of ins@@ tability and a threat to civil@@ ian popula@@ tions .
in this context , the European Commission is convinced that the local government should make use of existing mechanisms , including the J@@ o@@ int V@@ eri@@ fication M@@ ec@@ han@@ ism and the T@@ ri@@ part@@ ite Commission , to find a peaceful solution .
furthermore , the C@@ ong@@ o should implement without delay its plan , established with the support of the United Nations Organisation &apos;s M@@ is@@ sion in the Democ@@ ratic Republic of the C@@ ong@@ o ( MO@@ N@@ U@@ C ) , aimed at acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment and dem@@ ob@@ il@@ isation of foreign armed groups .
it should also speed up the integration and the training of its national ar@@ my in order to effectively dis@@ arm the e@@ x @-@ F@@ A@@ R mil@@ iti@@ as .
indeed , the establishment of peace and security in the region through bringing together the countries is our priority .
in this context , we see the resolution of the e@@ x @-@ F@@ A@@ R issue as essential and in@@ es@@ capable .
the Community is actively supporting the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese authorities in the reconstruction of the country through development projects for an overall amount of EUR 0@@ .@@ 5 billion .
the European Union is and remains the larg@@ est humanitarian aid don@@ or in C@@ ong@@ o and will continue its assistance .
thank you , Commissioner .
the vote will take place after the debates .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the@@ debate on six mo@@ tions for resolutions on B@@ hop@@ al .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s debate we are discussing issues we do not us@@ u@@ ally tou@@ ch upon .
the issues we generally debate are important , but they rela@@ te to financial perspec@@ tives , commun@@ ications solutions and economic matters .
these are all extremely important issues , but they are not tragic .
the three ite@@ ms on the agenda for today &apos;s afternoon debate , and in particular the third item on B@@ hop@@ al , concern one of the greatest tra@@ ge@@ dies to have oc@@ cur@@ red during the past few dec@@ ad@@ es .
this item relates to a trag@@ edy in which a gas explo@@ sion caused the immediate death of several ten@@ s of thousands of people .
the consequences of this explo@@ sion are unfortunately still being felt today .
the institutions and persons to be na@@ med shor@@ tly are responsible for this sa@@ d state of affairs .
the organisations which are to bla@@ me for what happened have ad@@ mitted their gu@@ il@@ t , as they have paid out compensation for the de@@ a@@ ths of 15@@ .@@ 2@@ 48 people .
they have also paid out compensation to 5@@ 5@@ 4@@ .@@ 8@@ 95 individuals who have fall@@ en ill or become disab@@ led , whilst attemp@@ ting to pay such compensation to as few people as possible .
broad estima@@ tes suggest that over 1@@ 00@@ .000 people have suffer@@ ed as a result of the gas explo@@ sion in B@@ hop@@ al 25 years ago , and millions are still suffering to this day due to environmental pollution .
what happened in the after@@ ma@@ th of the event ?
following an agreement and various court r@@ ul@@ ings , the gu@@ il@@ ty party , Union Car@@ b@@ ide Cor@@ por@@ ation In@@ dia , paid out US@@ D 4@@ 70 million in compensation .
this would appear to be no mean su@@ m , but the victims of the explo@@ sion received less than 10 % of the money .
the rest w@@ ent to the law@@ yers .
in pass@@ ing , it is worth no@@ ting that even in D@@ ic@@ ken@@ s &quot; tal@@ es of 1@@ 50 years ago , in which he enjo@@ yed descri@@ b@@ ing pre@@ d@@ atory law@@ yers , there are no ins@@ tan@@ ces of a victi@@ m receiv@@ ing vir@@ tually nothing .
the money van@@ ished , because in addition to pa@@ ying the law@@ yers &quot; fe@@ es , large amounts were alle@@ g@@ ed@@ ly used to pay off cor@@ rup@@ t officials .
it is in@@ toler@@ able that everyone has made money from this trag@@ edy excep@@ t its victims .
we are wit@@ n@@ esses to a con@@ spi@@ racy , and action must be taken to put things right .
this is the aim of the motion for a resolution we are to adopt today .
we must endeav@@ our to reas@@ s@@ ess the damage , so that compensation is paid to those entitled to it .
we must ensure that bodies are ap@@ pointed which can resolve this problem fair@@ ly .
Mr President , today we remember one of the wor@@ st industrial disas@@ ters in history .
as we have heard , in the de@@ ad of night on 2 December 198@@ 4 , a dead@@ ly 40 tonn@@ es of known and un@@ known pois@@ ons lea@@ ked into the air .
the people of B@@ hop@@ al tried to es@@ cap@@ e the pois@@ on@@ ous cl@@ ou@@ d .
their efforts were , however , fu@@ ti@@ le and ne@@ arly 4 000 people di@@ ed ins@@ tan@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously ; to date 25 000 inno@@ cent people have di@@ ed .
these are the b@@ are br@@ u@@ tal facts and today the people of B@@ hop@@ al are still suffering from this hor@@ ri@@ fying leg@@ acy .
that is why we cannot just remember , but must act as a community to help another .
we need to ask why after 20 years the pursu@@ it of justice has been so difficult for the sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors .
we need to ask why the trans@@ national cor@@ por@@ ation involved den@@ ies any continuing li@@ ability , either for the state of the B@@ hop@@ al sit@@ e or the victims &apos; health .
we need to ask why the sit@@ e has not been cle@@ an@@ ed of to@@ x@@ ic waste and continues to pollu@@ te the water the sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding communities rely on .
we need to know just how D@@ ow C@@ hem@@ ic@@ als can close the do@@ or on what was one of the wor@@ st industrial disas@@ ters in this century .
we also need to ask why so many people are still a@@ waiting adequate compensation .
I appreciate the issue of compensation is mi@@ red in end@@ less arguments as to the cal@@ cula@@ tions , but this is not a sufficient reason for the people of B@@ hop@@ al to have to reli@@ ve the experience day after day .
whilst I support the major part of the resolution and the s@@ enti@@ ment behind it , I do not believe the proposed amendments add anything constructive to this resolution .
it is vital when we talk about disas@@ ters such as B@@ hop@@ al that we do not des@@ c@@ end into pol@@ em@@ ics and ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ ality .
the alloc@@ ation of bla@@ me is all too often mis@@ placed and we often condemn all ag@@ ents without establishing all the facts .
as cha@@ ir of Parliament &apos;s South @-@ Asia SA@@ A@@ R@@ C delegation , I would urge you to keep all these matters in perspective , and the budget of each country is particularly relevant .
we must recognise the lim@@ itation of certain countries , which may not yet have developed the technologies or know @-@ how to deal with such disas@@ ters as quickly and as saf@@ ely as we have come to expect in our own countries .
we must also attempt to see each ang@@ le of an issue such as the B@@ hop@@ al disaster , and we should acknowledge the work that has already been done by the In@@ di@@ an Government and the Mad@@ hy@@ a P@@ ra@@ des@@ h Government with regard to me@@ dical care , economic and social assistance , environmental cle@@ an @-@ up , and finally financial compensation .
this short list goes to prove that a lot of work has already been done .
I feel it would be un@@ productive to vil@@ i@@ fy a government that has made efforts to re@@ me@@ dy and address the ple@@ th@@ or@@ a of problems ste@@ m@@ ming from B@@ hop@@ al .
rather , we need to emplo@@ y all our diplom@@ atic efforts to keep the pressure on the In@@ di@@ an Government to maintain its current efforts in providing compensation and working on d@@ et@@ o@@ xi@@ fication of the area .
nevertheless , if we demand that action is taken and money is spent , we should also be prepared to help in any way we can , including offer@@ ing technical and financial support .
we must not condemn without first examin@@ ing what we , as a community , can do to help .
we should continue to be constructive and offer the humanitarian , ec@@ ological and me@@ dical exper@@ t@@ ise we have to the Government of Mad@@ hy@@ a P@@ ra@@ des@@ h .
this is a role for the Commission , Member States and governments al@@ ik@@ e .
I would urge you , therefore , to pressure all those who can bring any reli@@ ef to those who have already suffer@@ ed in B@@ hop@@ al .
Mr President , while D@@ ow C@@ hem@@ ic@@ als and the In@@ di@@ an Government ar@@ gue over who is to bla@@ me for the B@@ hop@@ al disaster , the people continue to su@@ ffer and di@@ e from their two @-@ dec@@ ade leg@@ acy .
more than 7 000 people di@@ ed within days , but in@@ action has seen 15 000 further de@@ a@@ ths which could have been avoid@@ ed .
even today , 20 years on , neither side seems to care about the suffering , only about their re@@ pu@@ tations .
as many as 100 000 people are suffering ch@@ ron@@ ic and deb@@ il@@ ita@@ ting ill@@ n@@ esses , with 10 to 15 people a month continuing to di@@ e .
the sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors still wait for justice : compensation and me@@ dical assistance in many cases .
the pl@@ ant sit@@ e , which continues to pollu@@ te , will cost an estima@@ ted G@@ B@@ P 15 million to dec@@ om@@ mission , compared with D@@ ow &apos;s ye@@ arly sal@@ es of G@@ B@@ P 16 billion and In@@ dia &apos;s G@@ DP of G@@ B@@ P 3@@ 20 billion .
the In@@ di@@ an Government has also yet to spen@@ d US@@ D 3@@ 30 million of the original compensation given to them by Union Car@@ b@@ ide .
the pollution in the water supply in ne@@ ar@@ by s@@ lu@@ ms is also 500 times above the maximum recommend@@ ed W@@ H@@ O levels .
how can the international community , a mul@@ tin@@ ational company and one of the world &apos;s main countries , stand by and w@@ at@@ ch this happen ?
just now it should not be about who is to bla@@ me , but who is going to stop the suffering .
B@@ hop@@ al resid@@ ent , A@@ b@@ du@@ l J@@ ab@@ b@@ ar K@@ han , who run@@ s the B@@ hop@@ al Women G@@ as V@@ ic@@ ti@@ ms &apos; In@@ dus@@ trial Association , said in the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an new@@ s@@ paper in the UK : &apos; in New Yor@@ k after 9 / 11 there was compensation , pun@@ is@@ hment and cle@@ an @-@ up in just a few months .
in B@@ hop@@ al , after 20 years , we have nothing . &apos;
- Mr President , since c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial times , the countries of the developing world have been suppl@@ ying che@@ a@@ p products from the agricultural , min@@ ing and small @-@ scale cra@@ ft sectors to rich countries .
they rely on the rich countries in the North for impor@@ ts of expen@@ sive products based on new industrial technology .
that makes these countries extremely dependent on impor@@ ts and exports and results in a trade balance very un@@ fav@@ ourable to them .
just like the time when European countries exer@@ ted administrative power through military force , this distribution is still leading to permanent poverty and under@@ development in the D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing World .
it is easy to see , then , why the governments of these countries thought that all new indus@@ tries were to their advantage , in particular large @-@ scale me@@ tal and chem@@ ic@@ als indus@@ tries .
these countries had held little at@@ trac@@ tion for this kind of industry in the past , not only because the work@@ force was still in@@ suffici@@ ently tra@@ ined , but ch@@ i@@ efly because most custom@@ ers were in ric@@ her parts of the world and trans@@ porting fin@@ ished products was expen@@ sive .
the only industry that took ro@@ ot orig@@ in@@ ated from State @-@ ow@@ ned enterprises or ser@@ ved only the local market and the tou@@ ris@@ ts .
the need for str@@ onger industry in these countries was and is ab@@ used by indus@@ tries from the rich North because , although these indus@@ tries want to ex@@ p@@ and , the sou@@ thern countries are still not very important as markets whilst their pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power remains low .
investment in the South does become an at@@ trac@@ tive pros@@ pect for them , however , if w@@ ages are low and , in particular , if environmental and safety requirements there are less exac@@ ting or very poor@@ ly mon@@ ito@@ red .
this makes it possible for disas@@ ters in which many people su@@ ffer inc@@ ura@@ ble ill@@ ness or lose their lives to occ@@ ur .
this danger threa@@ ten@@ s not only the employees of those enterprises but also the people living in the neighbour@@ ho@@ od .
where disas@@ ters do happen , enterprises are not willing to bear the costs .
the gas explo@@ sion twenty years ago in B@@ hop@@ al and the way in which this was dealt with have a great deal to do with this .
neither Union Car@@ b@@ ide nor D@@ ow C@@ hem@@ ical nor the In@@ di@@ an Government are willing to produce sufficient compensation for the 20@@ .000 or more people ki@@ lled , for more than 1@@ 00@@ .000 people left with permanent in@@ j@@ uri@@ es , or for cle@@ an@@ ing up the con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of so@@ il and ground water .
a solution must be found , and disas@@ ters of this nature must never happen again .
let us Europeans take our responsibility , let us join in making payments if necessary , and most importan@@ tly let us la@@ y down rules to ensure that this kind of er@@ ro@@ r is not repe@@ ated by European enterprises .
Mr President , 20 years have passed since to@@ x@@ ic gas es@@ cap@@ ed from a fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er pl@@ ant in B@@ hop@@ al . nonetheless , its har@@ m@@ ful effects and environmental pollution are still affec@@ ting the lives of thousands of individuals .
this lea@@ k ki@@ lled over 7@@ .000 people during the night of 2 to 3 December 198@@ 4 .
a further 15@@ .000 people di@@ ed later as a result of it .
the lea@@ k is also responsible for ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ n@@ esses affec@@ ting more than 1@@ 00@@ .000 people .
the In@@ di@@ an Government and Union Car@@ b@@ ide or D@@ ow C@@ hem@@ ical , the current ow@@ ner of the fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er pl@@ ant , have as@@ sum@@ ed responsibility for the impact of the accident on the lives of thousands of people and the environment .
as stated in the resolution the House is to vote on today , an independent investi@@ gation of the current situation in B@@ hop@@ al must be carried out . this could be undertaken under the a@@ us@@ p@@ ices of the United Nations Hi@@ gh Commission on Human Rights .
experts must be involved .
they should visit In@@ dia and consider the consequences of Union Car@@ b@@ ide &apos;@@ sa@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and the B@@ hop@@ al disaster in terms of pollution of under@@ ground waters and the environment .
clearly , this also has consequences for human rights in the affected areas and communities .
in addition , the tragic case of B@@ hop@@ al highli@@ ghts the need to require companies to assu@@ me the same responsibilities as states in today &apos;s glob@@ alised world economy .
companies must be party to international agreements and conven@@ tions .
impact assess@@ ments need to be undertaken , both as regards respect for human rights and situations of armed conflict and ten@@ sion .
this is the ra@@ tion@@ ale under@@ p@@ inning the amendments proposed by the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance .
I appeal to honourable Members to study them carefully before decid@@ ing how to vote .
I should also like to take this opportunity to pub@@ lic@@ ise the proposal made by the S@@ cho@@ ol of Pe@@ ace C@@ ul@@ ture of the A@@ ut@@ onom@@ ous Uni@@ versity of Barcelona .
accord@@ ingly , I call on the House and the European Union to promote 3 December as an international day of cor@@ por@@ ate responsibility and human rights .
the aim is for companies to com@@ mit to the promotion and protection of human rights the world over .
this special date should be an opportunity for states , international bodies and civil society , amongst others , to reflect on their shared responsibility .
all international ac@@ tors share the duty of creating a fa@@ ire@@ r and more sustainable world .
Mr President , if you go to B@@ hop@@ al today - not 20 years ago , but today - you will see thousands of tonn@@ es of to@@ x@@ ic waste in pil@@ es , po@@ ols of mer@@ cur@@ y , s@@ ki@@ ps of pois@@ on@@ ed waste and b@@ ag@@ s of chem@@ ic@@ als lying in the open air , se@@ eping , wh@@ en@@ ever the ra@@ ins come , into the pu@@ d@@ d@@ les , stre@@ am@@ s and gro@@ und@@ water ; and you will see people suffering because they d@@ rin@@ k that water .
they su@@ ffer from pain@@ s in the s@@ tom@@ ach , head@@ ac@@ hes , an@@ a@@ em@@ ia and gy@@ na@@ ec@@ ological problems because they have no alternative but to d@@ rin@@ k from those w@@ ell@@ s .
that is the problem we are facing in B@@ hop@@ al today , and we are facing it 20 years after that ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ he , when so many people di@@ ed .
the figures range from 3@@ .000 to 7 000 on one night ; 15 000 later on and 100 000 people still suffering from deb@@ il@@ ita@@ ting diseases .
we are talking about 15 years after the sett@@ l@@ ement which gave US $ 500 million to the In@@ di@@ an Government to dis@@ bur@@ se for compensation and rec@@ ti@@ fication of that lan@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
it is still a pic@@ ture of des@@ ol@@ ation and danger for those people .
we in this Parliament do not do well when we seek to be jud@@ ge and jur@@ y in these cases .
that is why I cannot accept the Green amendments that have been referred to .
the motion itself stands well because it calls on the European Union to work with the Government of In@@ dia to use the money that is available to make sure that there is a cle@@ an @-@ up of those si@@ tes , treatment of affected people and compensation to those affected ; and now , not in another 20 years .
that is our message to all those affected : to the European Union ; to the In@@ di@@ an Government ; by all means , to D@@ ow C@@ hem@@ ic@@ als and its responsibilities and to the cour@@ ts which will be looking at that .
but today we seek justice for those people and ren@@ o@@ vation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of its people .
. Mr President , I am glad to be able to speak immediately after Mr B@@ ow@@ is , who has im@@ pres@@ sed upon us where we have got to 20 years after 3 December 198@@ 4 , when gas from a 35 @-@ tonn@@ e co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il of highly to@@ x@@ ic substances caused 7@@ .000 people to di@@ e when their hear@@ ts and l@@ un@@ gs failed .
to this day , some 2@@ 5@@ .000 have gone down in history as the victims of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est chem@@ ical accident ever recor@@ ded , and some 5@@ 00@@ .000 are still cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed as a consequ@@ ence of it .
what , though , was done for the victims ?
research has shown that , 15 years ago , compensation to the tun@@ e of US@@ D 4@@ 70 million was agreed on by Union Car@@ b@@ ide and the In@@ di@@ an Government .
so far , the 1@@ 00@@ .000 offici@@ ally regis@@ tered as victims have received US@@ D 3@@ 00 each .
there are 2@@ .@@ 500 h@@ ous@@ es for wid@@ ow@@ s along with se@@ ven h@@ os@@ pi@@ tal@@ s , and many facil@@ ities have been buil@@ t , but what has happened to the rest of the money , some US@@ D 4@@ 00 million ?
I have to tell Mrs G@@ ill that we really do have to ask who is to bla@@ me for that .
the ground is still con@@ ta@@ min@@ ated .
the ground water is he@@ a@@ vil@@ y con@@ ta@@ min@@ ated with mer@@ cur@@ y , and that is not going to go away .
to@@ x@@ ic resid@@ ues are sto@@ red in the open air .
small wonder , then , that we end up with the situation that Mr B@@ ow@@ is has described , with ch@@ ron@@ ic ill@@ n@@ esses , bra@@ in damage , and children bor@@ n with de@@ form@@ ities .
if there is to be any substantial improvement in me@@ dical provision for the victims , then the In@@ di@@ an Prime Minister , Mr S@@ ing@@ h , will have to interven@@ e , and the government should comply with the Su@@ pre@@ me Court &apos;s r@@ ul@@ ing and finally rele@@ ase the funds and enable full compensation to be paid out .
many chem@@ ical companies still have production operations in In@@ dia and in other parts of the world where labour and environmental standards are far bel@@ ow those that apply in the European Union or the USA .
as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs &quot; rapporteur on the R@@ E@@ AC@@ H programme , I can do no other than reiterate the demand made in the working paper : if there is to be compar@@ ability , we need rules made by the European Union , and , in the same way , rules laid down as standards by the WTO .
those whose desire for increased prof@@ its lead@@ s them to allow the minimum environmental requirements without excep@@ tion are accep@@ ting the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ o@@ od of a second B@@ hop@@ al one day , and that is something that n@@ one of us can affor@@ d .
. - Mr President , it has been twenty years since the trag@@ edy in B@@ hop@@ al in In@@ dia , with its huge humanitarian and ec@@ ological consequences , and I believe that the initiative by the political groups for the adoption of a motion in plenary by the European Parliament is particularly important .
however , it is not enough to jo@@ g the m@@ em@@ ory , it is not enough to condemn what is often the un@@ accoun@@ table operation of mul@@ tin@@ ational companies in developing countries , it is not enough just to state our humanitarian awareness in words .
this sort of trag@@ edy may be experienc@@ ed again by people in some other part of the world if the international community does not move to introduce international mechanisms for contro@@ lling the operation of mul@@ tin@@ ational companies , for protecting the environment and for protecting human rights and the rights of workers .
this is where the role of the European Union within the framework of the UN and within the framework of other international organisations may be more efficient .
the motion recor@@ ds the problems which still exist and numerous honourable members spoke about them in the area of B@@ hop@@ al as a whole .
however , in my opinion , it does not fully reflect the efforts made by the feder@@ al and regional authorities in In@@ dia over recent years in the fields of me@@ dical , economic , social and environmental res@@ t@@ itu@@ tion .
important policies have been implemented which we should not over@@ look .
to close , I consider that the best way for us to express our sy@@ mpa@@ thy with the victims and their families is for the European Commission to take initiatives in cooperation with the World Health Organisation on the implementation of me@@ dical and environmental res@@ t@@ itu@@ tion programmes .
- Mr President , Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mrs G@@ ry@@ b@@ a@@ us@@ ka@@ it@@ ė on her assu@@ mption of office , and to wish her the best of lu@@ ck .
as E@@ r@@ n@@ est H@@ em@@ ing@@ way once said , &apos; never send to know for whom the bel@@ l to@@ lls ; it to@@ lls for the@@ e . &quot;
it is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is concerning itself with regions of the world that are far remo@@ ved from Europe , and that it is doing so without regard to the requirements of political interest .
on the one hand , the European Union has declar@@ ed a strategic partnership with In@@ dia , and yet on the other hand , Parliament &apos;s resolution states that the In@@ di@@ an Government has done little to protect people from the effects of the B@@ hop@@ al disaster .
we are discussing the ne@@ g@@ li@@ g@@ ence of the In@@ di@@ an authorities , and rightly so , yet we should also make known our views on the li@@ ability of the US company that imposed sa@@ va@@ ge n@@ ine@@ te@@ ent@@ h @-@ century cap@@ ita@@ lis@@ m and failed to obser@@ ve any of the safety requirements that were man@@ d@@ atory in the USA .
the figures are as follows ; 7@@ .000 de@@ a@@ ths in the immediate after@@ ma@@ th of the disaster , and up to 3@@ 0@@ .000 de@@ a@@ ths over the 20 years which followed , with over 1@@ 00@@ .000 having fall@@ en ill to date .
obviously these statistics cannot express the human suffering , and merely conc@@ e@@ al the pain and te@@ ars .
B@@ hop@@ al must act as a war@@ ning for governments to put in place res@@ c@@ ue systems , and for them not to ab@@ and@@ on people .
it must act as a war@@ ning for international companies to ensure that the desire to make a prof@@ it does not re@@ place the desire to promote safety .
it must act as a war@@ ning for international structures and organisations to provide support to regions h@@ it by disas@@ ters .
in conclusion , Mr President , it should also act as a war@@ ning for us to call to account those who have taken such assistance from us or from anyone else .
. Mr President , the Commission wel@@ comes Parliament &apos;s initiative to laun@@ ch an urgent debate on this issue .
it is an important opportunity for us to reflect on the way in which we can offer help to the victims and how to prevent that set of disas@@ ters from oc@@ curr@@ ing in future .
let me assure Parliament that the Commission has been ready to support In@@ dia in dealing with this trag@@ edy and will do so in the future .
through our dec@@ entr@@ alised cooperation budget line , we have supported local non @-@ governmental organisations in B@@ hop@@ al with re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation and s@@ ki@@ lls training for victims of the disaster , as well as giving support to women &apos;s self @-@ help groups .
through our Health and F@@ am@@ ily W@@ el@@ fare Programme , we have supported the B@@ hop@@ al D@@ is@@ tric@@ t H@@ os@@ p@@ ital , as well as pati@@ ent welfare soci@@ eties of dis@@ tric@@ t h@@ os@@ pi@@ tal@@ s and community c@@ ent@@ res in the region .
special assistance was given to the M@@ un@@ ic@@ ip@@ al Cor@@ por@@ ation of B@@ hop@@ al for the prepar@@ ation of an ur@@ ban re@@ productive and child health plan .
in addition , the Commission has provided a grant of EUR 10 million for the funding of the Government of In@@ dia &apos;s Na@@ tional D@@ is@@ as@@ ter R@@ is@@ k Man@@ ag@@ ement Programme .
at the recent EU @-@ In@@ dia summit held in The H@@ ag@@ ue , In@@ dia re@@ confirmed its interest in pursu@@ ing an environment dialogue with the European Union and proposed the organisation of an EU @-@ In@@ dia environment for@@ um .
this for@@ um will be a first step in tac@@ kl@@ ing the enormous environmental problems that threa@@ ten both In@@ dia and the European Union .
let me fin@@ ish by expres@@ sing our deep@@ est sy@@ mpa@@ thy for all the victims and our firm hope that such a ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ he will never occ@@ ur again .
thank you , Commissioner .
we shall now proceed to the vote on these draft resolutions .
the debate is closed .
Mr President , I simply wis@@ hed to point out that there is a mis@@ take in the voting list cir@@ cula@@ ted to the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament .
as regards the amendments on B@@ hop@@ al , we voted against the first of these and in favour of the other three .
I should like to note that my c@@ ard has still not been regis@@ tered and is ref@@ using to work .
I wis@@ hed to vote in favour .
your comment has been noted .
Mr President , I would like to raise another point of order .
yesterday , we were voting until 2 p.@@ m .
it has in fact always been the cus@@ to@@ m of this House to vote between noon and 1.@@ 30 p.m. , because we do of course have a lot of l@@ un@@ ch@@ time commitments and we end up keeping our gu@@ es@@ ts waiting .
I would therefore ask the B@@ ure@@ au to make it a rule - as it was in the previous legislative period - that voting ends at 1.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish all those present in the Chamber a M@@ er@@ ry Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas and a H@@ app@@ y New Y@@ e@@ ar .
thank you for your comment , Mr R@@ ü@@ big .
I dec@@ l@@ are the session of the European Parliament ad@@ jour@@ ned , and I wish you all a M@@ er@@ ry Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas and a H@@ app@@ y New Y@@ e@@ ar 2005 .
the next item is the debate on the report ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 70 / 2004 ) by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe 2004 / 2@@ 12@@ 9 ( IN@@ I ) .
. Mr President , the enlargement of the European Union means we are having to up@@ gra@@ de from dri@@ ving a min@@ i@@ b@@ us , capable of taking 15 passengers , to a full @-@ sized b@@ us , capable of taking 25 , with some s@@ par@@ e se@@ ats to take on new passengers in due course .
this larg@@ er b@@ us needs a str@@ onger mo@@ tor if we are not to s@@ low down , and one that enab@@ les us to cross the difficult hi@@ lls that li@@ e on our path .
if we are to have a str@@ onger mo@@ tor , we will also occasi@@ on@@ ally need str@@ onger bra@@ kes - perhaps an emergency bra@@ ke - and better safety fe@@ a@@ tures too , such as a safety bel@@ t on each se@@ at .
since we are up@@ gra@@ ding , we should also have more com@@ for@@ table se@@ ats so that every passeng@@ er fe@@ els at home and com@@ for@@ table in this b@@ us .
also , while we are at it , why not have a ge@@ o @-@ sa@@ tell@@ ite pos@@ iti@@ on@@ ing system so we always know exactly where we are on the ro@@ ad@@ ma@@ p and can better plan the jour@@ ne@@ ys we want to take together by the most efficient and com@@ for@@ table rou@@ te ?
that is why we need a new set of rules for the European Union : a new Constitution to re@@ place the current constitutional order and the set of over@@ lap@@ p@@ ing Treaties .
in concrete terms this means a set of improvements that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteurs have identi@@ fied as fall@@ ing into four main categ@@ or@@ ies .
first , it means greater clar@@ ity as to what the Union is , how it works and func@@ tions .
under this head@@ ing one can identi@@ fy a single Treaty instead of the several over@@ lap@@ p@@ ing Treaties - a single , cle@@ ar@@ er document that spe@@ lls out more clearly the objectives and the values of the Union and its competences , what it is responsible for and what it is not responsible for , and how it works , with fe@@ wer and cle@@ ar@@ er procedures .
this will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our Union is about .
we will get rid of the distinc@@ tion between &apos; Union &apos; and &apos; Community &apos; , which nobody excep@@ t law@@ yers under@@ stands , creating a single legal entity .
it makes it clear that we are not creating some huge mon@@ oli@@ th@@ ic mon@@ s@@ ter - the my@@ th@@ ology of the super@@ state that some people seem to fear .
it is clear that we are not creating a cen@@ tr@@ alised Union .
second , it will provide for a more effective Union - a Union capable of decid@@ ing and ac@@ ting with 25 Member States .
it will make for more qualified majority voting and more continu@@ ity in the cha@@ ir@@ man@@ ship of the European Council .
there will be a single foreign minis@@ ter to speak for the Union to the outside world , instead of the Commission speaking on some issues and the Hi@@ gh Re@@ pres@@ enta@@ tive of the Council on others , which meant that third countries never k@@ new whom they had to deal with .
those pos@@ ts will be mer@@ ged into a single position .
third , and most important in my view , it will provide more democracy and accoun@@ tability in the Union .
under the Constitution , all legislation will be subject first to the pri@@ or scru@@ tin@@ y of national parliaments , and then the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level , such that both have to approve vir@@ tually every item of European legislation .
fran@@ kly , this makes the European Union the most democratic international structure , or sup@@ ran@@ ational structure , that exists in the world .
compar@@ e the EU to the I@@ M@@ F , to the World Bank , to the WTO or to any other international structure : n@@ one of them have or will have this degree of parliamentary in@@ put and of parliamentary scru@@ tin@@ y .
we should be pro@@ ud of the democracy that exists at the heart of this Union .
the Constitution will signific@@ antly reinfor@@ ce that democracy by exten@@ ding codecision , by giving Parliament the right to elec@@ t the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so @-@ called com@@ it@@ ology system for dele@@ g@@ ated secon@@ d@@ ary legislation .
four@@ th , the Constitution introduc@@ es greater rights for citizens through the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has been incorpor@@ ated into the Constitution .
this , of course , applies only in the field of competence of European Union law , but that is a significant field of competence , and all European legislation h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th will have to comply with that Charter .
all of this has led us to conclude that the Constitution is , to quo@@ te the committee &apos;s report , a &apos; vas@@ t improvement &apos; .
it is a vas@@ t improvement on the current Treaties and on the current constitutional order .
it mer@@ its our support .
these improvements are due in no small part to the in@@ put of the European Parliament into the Convention and the I@@ G@@ C .
we can be pro@@ ud of our results .
it is a compromise .
it is not a U@@ to@@ pian treaty .
all of us would have written it sli@@ ghtly differ@@ ently had we had to wr@@ ite it ourselves , but as a compromise package it is a distinc@@ t improvement .
I am conf@@ ident that tomorrow Parliament will endorse it by an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority .
this Parliament , elected by citizens across the whole of Europe , with parties from left to right across the political spec@@ tru@@ m , parties in government and parties in opposition , will send a power@@ ful signal if it endor@@ ses the Constitution tomorrow by an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority .
I am conf@@ ident it will .
.
Mr President , when at the last plenary session of the last term in office I had the hon@@ our of speaking on behalf of my group at an event held by this House in hom@@ age to M@@ onn@@ et , S@@ c@@ human and S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i , I won@@ der@@ ed what the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers , the visi@@ on@@ aries of Europe , would have thought of the point in European integration we were at and what they would have thought of the European Constitution .
I believe - I said it then and I repeat it today - that they would not have believ@@ ed that what was happening was real , because , lea@@ ving behind a Europe divid@@ ed by fra@@ tric@@ id@@ al conf@@ ron@@ tations , this Constitution sanctions peace on our continent and , to use Mr Ger@@ em@@ ek &apos;s be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful expression , this Constitution st@@ it@@ ches the two Euro@@ p@@ es together .
we are moving on from a Europe des@@ ol@@ ated by tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian reg@@ imes to a Europe - and this is san@@ c@@ tioned by the Constitution - based on democratic systems in which fundamental rights are respected .
after a Europe of ration bo@@ o@@ ks , this Constitution sanctions a Europe of prosperity and material well @-@ being .
over@@ coming a Europe which had dis@@ appe@@ ared from the world , this Constitution sanctions a Europe of solidarity , as demonstrated by the enormous wa@@ ve of solidarity which has ar@@ isen on our continent to deal with the effects of the other terri@@ ble wa@@ ve that struc@@ k Asia .
this Constitution will have , and does have , instruments which will allow Europe to play a greater role in the world from now on .
I believe that the Constitution mar@@ ks a point of no return and , just as , not so long ago , the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmon@@ y , which allowed us to move into the future , this European Constitution is going to allow all of us Europeans to move forward together within a project of common civil@@ isation .
the value of the European Constitution is that it remo@@ ves the ambi@@ gu@@ ities ; it is the first document to define what the European Union is , as a Union of States and citizens , and does not wea@@ ken the Member States , far from it , because the Union &apos;s competences are competences that come from the Member States , and it does not wea@@ ken national Con@@ stitu@@ tions , quite the contrary : it strength@@ ens them , because the streng@@ th of the European Constitution ste@@ ms from the streng@@ th of the national Con@@ stitu@@ tions .
with this Constitution , Europe is demonstra@@ ting that it is much more than a market ; it is a market as well , and that is important , but it is much more : it is a project of common civil@@ isation based on our religious , cultural and human@@ ist her@@ ita@@ ge .
this is acknowled@@ ged in the first sen@@ tence of the pre@@ am@@ ble , based on the values of freedom and human dignity , foun@@ ded upon the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
it is also a Constitution that op@@ ts for a particular economic system : a cap@@ ita@@ list system with a social dimension .
if we look at the history of Europe , we see that that was not so obvious fif@@ ty years ago .
today it is .
for all of these reasons , I believe , Mr President , that many of the fla@@ gs that this Parliament has un@@ fur@@ led over recent years are today standing as pro@@ ud as those we have behind us .
I join@@ ed this Parliament 13 years ago , when it was a consul@@ ta@@ tive ass@@ embly ; today it no longer is .
I join@@ ed this Parliament when there was talk of the European Union &apos;s democratic defic@@ it ; I believe that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic defic@@ it , because this Constitution introduc@@ es more democracy , more efficiency , more clar@@ ity and more transparency , as my fri@@ end , R@@ ic@@ hard Cor@@ bet@@ t , has quite rightly pointed out .
Mr President , this work has been done by many people over many years .
I would like to acknowledge them today .
I would like to remind you of the na@@ mes of E@@ mili@@ o Col@@ om@@ b@@ o , Mar@@ c@@ elin@@ o O@@ re@@ ja , F@@ er@@ n@@ and Her@@ man , G@@ i@@ or@@ gi@@ o Na@@ poli@@ tan@@ o , O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Du@@ ha@@ me@@ l , An@@ ton@@ io Se@@ g@@ ur@@ o , D@@ im@@ it@@ r@@ is T@@ sa@@ t@@ so@@ s , An@@ to@@ in@@ ette S@@ pa@@ a@@ k , and so many people who , se@@ ated here in this Parliament , have def@@ en@@ ded what today is going to become a reality .
they have often been called u@@ to@@ pi@@ ans or dre@@ am@@ ers ; well , today , these dre@@ am@@ s , these u@@ to@@ pi@@ as , are becoming reality .
we in this Parliament can feel very pro@@ ud of the work we have done .
Mr President , eight years ago in this very Chamber , a young Member of Parliament def@@ en@@ ded the opinion on the Treaty of Amster@@ dam and said that it was not perfec@@ t , as we k@@ new , but that it was not the final des@@ tin@@ ation , and ci@@ ted , as I am going to do again today , a Mi@@ gu@@ el de C@@ er@@ van@@ tes dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted with life in his final days , who said that there were occasions when we had to choose whether to be a road or an in@@ n .
that was a road , and that road has led us to where we are today and I believe that today , in this com@@ for@@ table in@@ n represented by the European Constitution , over the coming years we Europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace , freedom , justice and solidarity .
I would , therefore , be delighted if tomorrow this Parliament votes in favour of this document , and this is very important , since it us@@ h@@ ers in a new er@@ a on our continent .
Mr Sch@@ mit has the floor on behalf of the Council , and I would like to thank him in particular for being here , and also express our cond@@ ol@@ ences to him and the people of Luxemb@@ our@@ g , who are in national m@@ our@@ ning following the death of the G@@ r@@ and Du@@ ch@@ ess .
Mr President , I should like to thank you for these expres@@ sions of solidarity with the people of Luxemb@@ our@@ g at a time of great sor@@ row .
I am very grateful indeed .
personally , this is the first time that I have had the hon@@ our of appe@@ aring before Parliament and it is therefore a great hon@@ our and a great ple@@ asure to be able to speak in this House , on the Council &apos;s behalf , on a matter as important as the draft European Constitution .
I had the opportunity to work with some of you in the Convention and I feel that I can say that the work done in the Convention was historic , remar@@ ka@@ ble work that under@@ lines the importance of the process that we are currently pursu@@ ing .
in this context , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
the message that you all wish to send out tomorrow by means of an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming vote in Parliament is also intended for the citizens , because this Constitution is primarily a constitution for the citizens ; it is they who will der@@ i@@ ve the greatest benefit from it .
it has been said that this Constitution democ@@ rat@@ ises our Union .
it strength@@ ens citizens &quot; rights , through the Charter of Fundamental Rights ; it conf@@ ers new rights on Europe &apos;s citizens , by giving them the opportunity to inte@@ rac@@ t with the institutions and in particular the Commission .
this Treaty confir@@ ms that we are no longer an economic Union and that we are more than a political Union in the making ; we are , first and fore@@ most , a Union based on common values .
in this respect , the Constitution is a crucial step in the integration process .
once Parliament has had its say , it will be the citizens &quot; turn to speak , either directly , through referendu@@ ms , in countries where referendu@@ ms are to be held , or in@@ directly , through parliamentary ratification .
the Council is committed to chan@@ ne@@ lling all the necessary ener@@ g@@ ies for this Constitution to be adopted in all Member States .
each Member State , each government and each parliament now has the responsibility to take us over this h@@ ur@@ dle so that the Constitution can enter into force , and , I should add , on the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed date .
the European Parliament , national governments and national parliaments share a great responsibility in this respect .
we must work together if we are to meet this challenge .
. Mr President , the Constitution before us today would not have been possible without the European Parliament .
this House has played a crucial role in strengthening the foun@@ dations of our common enterpris@@ e , not least through the substantial contributions made by Members of this Parliament during the European Convention .
it would also not have been possible without that European Convention , which provided such a dyna@@ mic , open and innova@@ tive means of negoti@@ ation .
the involvement of the European Parliament in this un@@ preced@@ ented process cul@@ min@@ ates today with an excellent and well @-@ written report , which sen@@ ds a clear message on the benefits of the Constitution and the need for its ratification .
I wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly congratulate Parliament , and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the two rapporteurs , R@@ ic@@ hard Cor@@ bet@@ t and Í@@ ñ@@ ig@@ o M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o .
the Commission fully supports your resolution .
we firmly believe that the Constitution allows the Union to make significant improvements .
in simple terms , for the first time the powers , competences , rights and du@@ ties of the Union are set out in a single Constitution .
the Constitution consolid@@ ates and simp@@ lif@@ ies half a century of treaty changes , allowing us to move from 12 basic treaty acts to a single text .
it makes the Union more open and si@@ m@@ pl@@ er to understand .
the Constitution modern@@ ises the institutional structure .
it increas@@ es the powers of the European Parliament and provides for citizens actively to participate in the decision @-@ making process through a pet@@ ition with one million sig@@ na@@ tures .
we will have more democracy .
the Constitution s@@ ets out , in 5@@ 4 conc@@ ise ar@@ tic@@ les , the fundamental rights we will guarantee to our citizens .
for the first time the Union will acc@@ ed@@ e to the European Convention on Human Rights , so there will be more rights for our citizens .
these three simple concep@@ ts - more rights , more democracy and more op@@ enn@@ ess - explain why this Constitution should be rati@@ fied .
we would certainly have wis@@ hed to be more ambitious in certain policy areas , but the final result is the best possible compromise in the current political situation .
I also accept that people have fe@@ ars and critic@@ isms regarding this Constitution .
it is not a perfec@@ t text and we should not h@@ ide from respon@@ ding to these concerns .
our latest Euro@@ bar@@ om@@ e@@ ter sur@@ ve@@ y shows that 6@@ 8 % of our citizens support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution .
other opinion po@@ lls show that many feel they are ina@@ dequ@@ ately informed about the content of the Constitution .
your report has made a good start by rejec@@ ting some of the mis@@ concep@@ tions and sc@@ are s@@ tor@@ ies about the Constitution .
it provides a range of good reasons for the Euro @-@ speci@@ alists to be voting yes , but these are not always the reasons that will per@@ su@@ ade a single mo@@ ther in G@@ d@@ ans@@ k , or a ship@@ y@@ ard work@@ er in Spain to do so .
the ratification of the Constitution is an opportunity to debate the kind of Europe we want .
I welcome this opportunity to remind ourselves of what Europe has achieved and what Europe stands for , as has so el@@ e@@ gan@@ tly been expla@@ ined by others .
in the mid @-@ 198@@ 0@@ s , the vision of creating a genuine single market seem@@ ed a br@@ id@@ ge too far .
and yet it happened , bringing in its wa@@ ke an economic dyna@@ mis@@ m from which we still benefit .
to c@@ ite one simple example , the fact that we do not have to go through custom@@ s at borders has dra@@ ma@@ tically reduced costs and deli@@ very times .
in a single step we remo@@ ved the need for 60 million V@@ A@@ T documents per year .
today , the youn@@ ger generation tre@@ at as a right the idea of a zone of free movement , in the same way that they expect the Union to ensure a cle@@ an environment and cross @-@ border cooperation on public health .
today , in 12 countries of the EU , we have a pi@@ ece of Europe in our po@@ c@@ ket@@ s , with the euro being taken for granted across the Union and with new Member States join@@ ing the qu@@ e@@ ue to introduce it .
finally , first through membership of Greece , Spain and Portugal and now with the 10 new Member States , we have help@@ ed guarantee and consolid@@ ate democracy and the rule of law across the whole continent .
we must now turn to the ratification of the Constitution .
while we respect our different constitutional ro@@ les in relation to the national ratification processes , we cannot toler@@ ate the debate being conf@@ used by my@@ ths or mis@@ concep@@ tions about the content of the Constitution .
all of us have a duty to make available clear and reli@@ able information on what the Constitution does and the benefits it can bring .
in so doing we must compar@@ e the results of the Constitution with the current situation .
Li@@ thu@@ ania and H@@ un@@ g@@ ary have already rati@@ fied the Constitution .
I would , in particular , like to pay tribu@@ te to Li@@ thu@@ ania and the speak@@ er of the Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian Parliament , who is here in the Chamber today .
we must now start to show what concrete impact the Constitution can have on the daily lives of the people we represent .
indeed , there is no shor@@ ta@@ ge of good examples in this respect .
as I said earlier , the inclu@@ sion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from a symb@@ ol@@ ic innovation .
citizens will have a ca@@ ta@@ lo@@ gue of rights and principles whose respect by the public authorities - be they European or national - they will be entitled to invo@@ ke before the cour@@ ts .
the possibility of concrete participation in the functioning of the Union is extended far beyond the election of the Members of the European Parliament .
the citizens &apos; initiative will , for the first time , make European citizens pro@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ ists in the legislative process .
modern@@ isation of the area of freedom , security and justice will allow the Union to respond to the growing demand for more effective European action in the fields of border controls , asylum and immigration .
the same is true for judicial and police cooperation .
the Constitution la@@ ys the foun@@ dations for a single area of liber@@ ties and guarantees .
the new provisions on public health will provide higher quality standards with regard to safety .
the Union will be able to interven@@ e in a more effective way to prevent and fight cross @-@ border health thre@@ ats such as avi@@ an f@@ l@@ u or BSE .
today , we cannot avoid thinking about the tragic events in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
the Union is already playing a key role in providing humanitarian aid and contribu@@ ting to the political , economic and social reconstruction of that region .
the new provisions on civil protection , which en@@ trust the Union with the task of promoting consisten@@ cy in international civil protection work , will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the future .
we have , of course , already put in place a number of initiatives aimed at infor@@ ming the public about the content of the Constitution .
the Commission has produced written and au@@ di@@ o @-@ vis@@ ual material , developed a we@@ b@@ sit@@ e , promo@@ ted and finan@@ ced information rela@@ ys , and s@@ pon@@ so@@ red sem@@ in@@ ars and other public initiatives .
the European Council has supported our efforts , calling on the Member States to improve their capacity for communication about European issues in the context of the ratification of the Constitution .
it is now time to move up a ge@@ ar .
I se@@ iz@@ e this occasion to call on you to examine the possibility of putting in place joint communication initiatives with us that can max@@ im@@ ise the impact of our initiatives .
I refer , in particular , to the possibility of organis@@ ing media events at both European and national level during a &apos; European week &apos; , around 9 May 2005 .
in the mean@@ time the Commission will not re@@ fra@@ in from developing other ideas that can assis@@ t the Member States in drawing up and implementing their national communication strateg@@ ies .
I can also assure you that the Commissioners themselves will be active in the debate on the Constitution and the future of Europe .
sec@@ uring the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is the main concern for the Member States and for the European institutions .
however , while we do not intend to anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate application of the Constitution , we must also de@@ vote some effort to ensuring a smo@@ o@@ th entry into force of the Constitution once the ratification procedures have been success@@ fully fin@@ alised .
that is why we need to open discussions on preparing for implementation of the current provisions .
the Commission has been eng@@ aged in this process from the start .
we are pro@@ ud of the text of the Constitution and will do our ut@@ most to ensure that it se@@ es the light of day .
I remain committed to dialogue with the European Parliament .
our work will not stop today .
in fact it is only just starting .
I look forward to deb@@ ating these issues in more detail with the Constitutional Affairs Committee and join@@ ing you on different pla@@ t@@ forms to present our case .
in conclusion , I return to my three simple concep@@ ts : more rights , more democracy and more op@@ enn@@ ess .
this year we will cel@@ eb@@ rate the 15@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the re@@ b@@ ir@@ th of democracy in E@@ as@@ tern Europe .
setting asi@@ de all other provisions of the Constitution , these three concep@@ ts alone under@@ line why countries have join@@ ed the European Union and why the Commission will defend this Constitution .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have come a long way , and those of us who were Members of the previous Parliament will be able to remember how , in this Chamber , we deb@@ ated the Treaty of Nice .
at the time , many of us were un@@ satisfied with it , and we said that our stan@@ ce on the Treaty of Nice would ultimately depen@@ d on what new method of reform we might have in the future and on what the efforts at reform added up to .
the result of that is in fron@@ t of us today : the Treaty on a Constitution for the European Union .
un@@ like in December 2000 , when we discussed Nice in the abs@@ ence of the Central European countries - E@@ st@@ onia , Lat@@ via and Li@@ thu@@ ania , Pol@@ and , C@@ z@@ ech@@ os@@ lo@@ va@@ kia ( which is now the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h Republic ) , Slova@@ kia , H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , and Slo@@ ven@@ ia , not to mention M@@ alta and Cyprus , n@@ one of whom had yet join@@ ed us , it is a particularly happy circum@@ stan@@ ce that today , the day when we are deb@@ ating the Constitution , we have among us Members from these countries , particularly from those European countries that were once Commun@@ ist .
I think that is a won@@ der@@ ful sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the future we share on the continent of Europe .
I would like to extend very war@@ m thanks to Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o for the out@@ standing work they have done together with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , and also to all those who assis@@ ted them in it .
today , I would also like to thank the Cha@@ irman of the Convention , Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing , for the work he did , which was sometimes on the receiv@@ ing end of criticism , but if he had not done as he did , we would probably not have this Constitution today , and so Mr G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing deser@@ ves our warm@@ est gra@@ t@@ itude today .
we are the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) - and of the European Democrats .
there are 12@@ 8 MEPs in the European People &apos;s Party , and the DE part of our group has 40 Members .
speaking for the PPE part of our group , I can assure you that we will be saying &apos; yes &quot; to this Constitution without reser@@ vations , while the European Democrats in our group are entitled to come up with their own positions .
a constitution needs values .
almost as crucial as the procedures are the values that bin@@ d us together , for if we have no awareness of values , we have no foun@@ d@@ ation on the basis of which we can take political action .
we re@@ jo@@ ice that many of our values , which we see as Christian , have been included : human dignity , the dignity of ol@@ der people , the worth of children too .
I think it particularly s@@ plen@@ did that children get a mention in the Constitution , for without children , this continent has no future , that we have described our values and bann@@ ed cl@@ on@@ ing , and that reference is made to our principles - the rule of law , democracy , subsidiarity and solidarity .
all these things give us cause to say &apos; yes . &quot;
today , though , I would not wish to den@@ y that many of us would have welcomed a reference to G@@ od in the Constitution , because it aff@@ ir@@ ms that our human capac@@ ities are not in@@ fin@@ ite .
we would also have been glad to see reference made to our Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o @-@ Christian her@@ ita@@ ge , for , at a time when dialogue with the world &apos;s cul@@ tures is so necessary - particularly with the Isla@@ mic world - I believe that it is important that we know where our own ro@@ ots are , and that our cultural and religious development should be mentioned in the Constitution .
even though that is not in the Constitution , every Constitution is of course a compromise , and so we say &apos; yes &quot; to this Constitution , because it reflec@@ ts our values .
it is also proper that a constitution should include a descri@@ p@@ tion of the constitutional structure of the European Union , and I think it is particularly successful in this , talking as it does in terms of national id@@ entity .
Europe is not a mel@@ ting po@@ t , nor is it meant to become a super@@ state ; on the contrary , it is in its diversity that Europe &apos;s we@@ alth is to be found , beginning in our to@@ w@@ ns and communities , where people live , and in the regions .
our nation states have their own id@@ ent@@ ities .
we have a Constitutional Treaty which declar@@ es that it is from the nation states that the Constitution orig@@ ina@@ tes .
it is through our own national citiz@@ en@@ ship that we are citizens of Europe , and hence freedom of organisation for local authorities is made expl@@ ic@@ it in the subsidi@@ ary structure of Europe .
I think that is quite a mas@@ ter@@ stro@@ ke .
J@@ ean M@@ onn@@ et , the first H@@ on@@ or@@ ary C@@ itiz@@ en of Europe , once said that nothing is possible without people , and that nothing las@@ ts without institutions , and what he said is true to this day .
if we do not have values which under@@ p@@ in everything , and if these values are not ultimately expressed in institutions that emb@@ o@@ dy them , then those values cannot be realis@@ ed .
that is why it is right that we should follow J@@ ean M@@ onn@@ et &apos;s direc@@ tions and go down the road that lead@@ s to Europe as a community , and , my de@@ ar friends - I a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise for using an expression current in my own party , but , as we are talking about the Constitution today , we are some@@ how join@@ ed together as one , not that our differences should be ob@@ s@@ cu@@ red - neither now nor in the future must it be inter@@ govern@@ menta@@ lis@@ m or cooperation between governments that s@@ hap@@ es the European Union .
the Europe of the future must rather be foun@@ ded upon the Community method , and upon the Community action of the European institutions .
what this means for us is that we need a strong European Parliament , one that is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of democracy , that we should act as equ@@ als in all matters affec@@ ting European legislation , that we need a strong Commission , der@@ iv@@ ing its legitim@@ acy from its election by the European Parliament and hence also from European elections , and that we have to have a Council of Ministers whose actions are transparent .
let me conclude by saying that much that is in the Constitution is in the nature of a programme and has yet to become reality .
an example of this is Article 7@@ 50 , which states how we are to live as good neighbours al@@ ong@@ side the peoples of Europe who have a European vo@@ cation - and right now it is Ukraine of which I am thinking .
another is foreign policy , an area in which we cannot , in future , allow ourselves to speak with two or three vo@@ ices , but must act join@@ tly .
that is why it is not Member States of the European Union , as such , that should be seeking to join the UN Security Council , but rather the European Union as a whole , if it wants to be a global ac@@ tor for human rights and democracy .
it is the European Union as such that must be represented in the United Nations .
we have many tasks ahead of us .
I speak for my group when I say that I hope there will be broad support for this Constitution , not only here in this House , but also in all the Member States , because this Constitution is the means where@@ by we will get through the twenty @-@ first century as a Europe of freedom , democracy and peace .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this coming 27 January will mark the si@@ x@@ tiet@@ h an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the liber@@ ation of the concentra@@ tion cam@@ p at Aus@@ ch@@ wit@@ z .
the foun@@ d@@ ation of the European Co@@ al and S@@ te@@ el Community a few years later was a direct consequ@@ ence of what had happened during the Sec@@ ond World W@@ ar .
the fa@@ th@@ ers and mo@@ th@@ ers of European cooperation could see with their own e@@ yes that ul@@ tra @-@ nation@@ alism , F@@ as@@ c@@ ism , and the div@@ ision of our continent by B@@ ol@@ s@@ he@@ vis@@ m , always resul@@ ted in op@@ pression , in terro@@ r , and in the dignity of the individual being lost .
they could also see that what created peace , dignity and democracy was sup@@ ran@@ ational action and integration at a sup@@ ran@@ ational , European level .
it is worth ad@@ ding that this was then achieved through the Co@@ al and S@@ te@@ el Community ga@@ ining control of the weapons @-@ manufac@@ turing indus@@ tries .
what we saw happening in the 199@@ 0@@ s , when the states that have now acc@@ ed@@ ed took their present form , was , in principle , a tri@@ ump@@ h over Commun@@ ist op@@ pression in one part of Europe .
the European Union is a union that has managed to take the values described in our Charter of Fundamental Rights and use them as the basis of democratic integration and to overcome both the F@@ as@@ c@@ ism and the Commun@@ ism of Europe &apos;s past .
the events of recent days , in which people have been power@@ less in the face of forces that no amount of technology has enab@@ led them to conf@@ ron@@ t , show how absolutely necessary it is for action to be taken at the sup@@ ran@@ ational level , with no national borders standing in the way .
in the global vill@@ age , the European Union is Europe &apos;s ra@@ tional and modern response to the challenges of the twenty @-@ first century .
the Constitution we are now deb@@ ating is the framework provided for it .
our group will be voting in favour of the Cor@@ bet@@ t / M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o report - out of prof@@ ound con@@ vic@@ tion , and also out of the con@@ vic@@ tion that the values described in this constitution are civil values .
the s@@ plen@@ did thing about them is that you can understand them as Christian values if you are a Christian .
you can understand them as your own values if you are a J@@ ew or a M@@ os@@ le@@ m or an un@@ beli@@ ever .
these values are univers@@ al and in@@ div@@ isi@@ ble , and so they are val@@ id for everyone .
that also makes it easy for us , despite the div@@ isions that otherwise separate us , to join together in supporting this Constitution , but if we do that , it is our shared basis for a democratic and dig@@ ni@@ fied future in a social community with social responsibility and economic prosperity .
in the knowledge @-@ based society of the future , this Union of ours must , at one and the same time - and the Constitution does indeed set this out in b@@ lack and wh@@ ite - per@@ form its social tasks and guarantee the protection of the individual and of every citizen from the dang@@ ers present in this divid@@ ed world .
that is what this Constitution will be able to achieve , and we are largely agreed that we are willing and obliged to stand up for it and con@@ ten@@ d for it .
one thing alone is la@@ cking , and , speaking for our group , I will s@@ pel@@ l out what it is .
for the European Parliament to com@@ mit itself and mo@@ bil@@ ise itself is not enough .
those who signed their na@@ mes to this Constitution at the dig@@ ni@@ fied cer@@ em@@ on@@ y in R@@ ome , which all of us cha@@ ir@@ men of groups were allowed to atten@@ d , Europe &apos;s Heads of State or Government and foreign ministers , must , in the same way as we do , appear before the peoples and dec@@ l@@ are that this is our Constitution and that we want it .
far from this being one individual matter to be left to the European Parliament or to the Commission , the sta@@ te@@ sm@@ en and sta@@ te@@ s@@ women of Europe must do their part and aff@@ ir@@ m this to be their work - not only the work of the European Parliament or of the Convention on their own .
it is those things too , but it is the work of all those who carry responsibility for Europe &apos;s future , and they must aff@@ ir@@ m , before the peoples of Europe , their support for it .
if they do that , this Constitution will enjo@@ y majority support , with the support of the PPE Group and probably even of that Group &apos;s European Democrats .
. Mr President , Mr Poettering properly remin@@ ds us that when Parliament reac@@ ted to previous reforms of the Treaties , the resolutions adopted were pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed with regre@@ ts , critic@@ isms and things that we de@@ pl@@ or@@ e , plu@@ s demands for further reform .
this time , we are not obliged to do this because we ourselves have been pro@@ min@@ ently involved in the draf@@ ting of the reforms , both in the Convention and the I@@ G@@ C .
this report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o gets the s@@ tory right and I am pleased to say that all Members of my Group who will be speaking today will be speaking in favour of this resolution .
there@@ after we will be out campa@@ ig@@ ning for the entry into force in@@ side the Member States where referen@@ da are to be held , including in France - to op@@ pose certain fac@@ tions of the left - and in Bri@@ tain , where we will be fighting to op@@ pose the right .
the princi@@ p@@ al argument for this great reform is clearly that it strength@@ ens the European Union .
it strength@@ ens our capacity to act ab@@ road and in@@ side our Member States , making us prepared to stand on our own fe@@ et in world affairs , s@@ hap@@ ing Europe &apos;s response to globalisation politically .
the Constitution re@@ defin@@ es the European Union .
it strik@@ es a balance between states - the old and the new , the large and the small - between citizens and the authorities and , as Mr G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing has said , between dre@@ am and reality .
it has created a f@@ res@@ h , large consensus behind the project of European integration .
a word to those such as the British Con@@ serva@@ tives who car@@ p on the si@@ d@@ elines : if you are for Europe , you should be for the Constitution .
Europe cannot be construc@@ ted without clear , liber@@ al and social values , strong rules and ro@@ b@@ ust parliamentary democracy .
Europe will not work without strong authorities in Brussels .
without the Constitution , things will not work properly and the quality of policy flo@@ wing from Brussels and Strasbourg will begin to dec@@ line .
future ex@@ pan@@ sion will be out of the question and I cannot believe that is what the British Con@@ serva@@ tive Party really believes in .
but Europe cannot work either without strong lead@@ ership .
this Parliament must learn to f@@ ill some of the strategic space that the reforms begin to open up for us .
we have many new powers , including , importan@@ tly , the right to propose a reform - a reform in the future of the Constitution itself .
the Commission must as@@ ser@@ t itself quickly as the new arrangements for the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Ser@@ vice , the te@@ am presidency and especially the so @-@ called full @-@ time President of the European Council are put in place .
the pr@@ ime ministers and presid@@ ents must coordin@@ ate their campa@@ ig@@ ns .
I am pleased to hear what Mr Sch@@ mit said on that .
they must sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der their individual and collective responsibility to w@@ in these referendum campa@@ ig@@ ns by show@@ ing the vo@@ ters why these reforms are for them and why this is truly the Constitution for Europe .
. - Mr President , a majority in the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance is in favour of ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , because it se@@ es it as an important step on the road leading to the political integration of our continent .
despite the Treaty &apos;s many short@@ com@@ ings , there are no other alterna@@ tives in the current political and institutional context .
the proposed Constitution establis@@ hes the Union as a community based on fundamental rights , grounds European policies in a co@@ de of common values , defin@@ es clear and binding objectives , and expres@@ ses a commitment to up@@ hold sustain@@ ability in the economic , social and environmental fields .
it includes social rights among traditional human rights , ties the Union &apos;s external actions to compliance with international law , simp@@ lif@@ ies procedures , clari@@ f@@ ies competences , ex@@ pan@@ ds the scope of Community decisions , and increas@@ es transparency and the democratic legitim@@ acy of the Union , as well as opportunities for its citizens to play a part .
the text has a good many g@@ ap@@ s and pit@@ fall@@ s in it , and it is under@@ stand@@ able that there should be growing dis@@ affec@@ tion towards the European project among many people , associ@@ ations and mo@@ v@@ ements politically close to us , in whose e@@ yes the Union is not yet able to respond to their concerns or to be a political entity fully able to act for a better , less un@@ fair world .
to den@@ y this reality , as our fellow Members do in their report , is , in our view , in@@ appropriate .
for us Gre@@ ens , the European integration process cannot be considered complete with the adoption of the Constitution , par@@ tly because other countries and peoples , beyond the current 25 , are still fin@@ is@@ hing or starting out on their jour@@ ne@@ y to join the Union .
in that respect too , un@@ like the rapporteurs , we believe that the Union &apos;s institutional system is still too conf@@ used and compl@@ icated and will not last much longer without further reform .
we therefore believe that any development and improvement of the future European Union will depen@@ d on ratification of this text .
it is a dangerous ill@@ u@@ sion to believe that rejec@@ ting this text would prepare the way for another , better or even ide@@ al constitution .
on the contrary , th@@ ro@@ wing it out would leave us with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice , which are much less advan@@ ced in terms of both the values of their objectives and the institutional structure they propose .
if the Treaty were de@@ fe@@ ated , it would be an ide@@ al opportunity for the Euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tics to point out that the people no longer want Europe , where@@ as we know very well that this is not the case .
it would also conv@@ in@@ ce many governments that the Convention method - that ti@@ mid , half @-@ hear@@ ted attempt to over@@ th@@ row un@@ democratic , ine@@ fficient methods of reform like diplom@@ atic talks and the power of ve@@ to - can lead no@@ where .
we therefore have a double objective : to approve this Constitution so that we can quickly la@@ y the foun@@ dations for its success@@ or , by seeking to build a strong , stable alli@@ ance with those political , social , associ@@ ative and economic forces that believe , as we do , that in order to achieve our aims of social justice , ec@@ olog@@ ically sustainable development and peace , we must not only w@@ in the elections again at a national level , but also make European democracy str@@ onger and more complete .
to do that , we need to take back the initiative , and it is on that point , Mr President , that I believe it will be possible to re@@ build a united fron@@ t of all those who are today convinced of the in@@ es@@ capable need for European democracy but are divid@@ ed in their evaluation of this text .
. - Mr President , the report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o concentra@@ tes almost exclu@@ sively on a series of new provisions that are not in the current Treaties .
such provisions include re@@ pla@@ cing the ro@@ ta@@ ting presidency with a more stable two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year presidency , creating the post of minis@@ ter for foreign affairs , al@@ be@@ it without com@@ mu@@ ni@@ tar@@ ising the common foreign and security policy , strengthening Parliament &apos;s powers , according national parliaments the right to call the Commission to account , where they feel it has over@@ ste@@ pped its powers , and giving a million citizens the opportunity to propose that the Commission table a draft law on a particular matter .
if the text submitted for ratification by the citizens or by the parliaments were in fact limited to that type of provision , many members of my group - not all , but many of them , including me - would not be opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty .
we are in favour of Europe and in favour of anything that ser@@ ves to enhan@@ ce Europe &apos;s democracy and improve its functioning .
we should not be b@@ rac@@ ke@@ ted with the UK In@@ depend@@ ence Party .
we feel that there is a great need for Europe in this glob@@ alised world , but what guidelines and structures do we need for Europe ?
that is the question .
the first thing we need , in our view , is a set of guidelines and structures that enable us , at Union level , to control the financial markets , rather than be entirely at their mer@@ cy , as we are now .
this can be done , provided that it is agreed to make use of power@@ ful le@@ vers such as the Central Bank and taxation of the capital of major public bodies ; to make laws aimed at holding companies accoun@@ table on social , environmental , democratic and eth@@ ical issues ; to chan@@ nel funds thus rele@@ ased into major political priorities that are pub@@ lic@@ ly deb@@ ated , democra@@ tically established and reg@@ ularly assess@@ ed .
Europe is therefore the appropriate level to meet challenges that a single country would no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys have difficul@@ ty in tac@@ kl@@ ing , due to globalisation .
it follows , for that very reason , that we need guidelines and structures where@@ by we can re@@ ver@@ se the tr@@ end of maintaining the main decision @-@ making c@@ ent@@ res at a dis@@ tance from the people , and where@@ by we can rec@@ laim pop@@ ular soverei@@ gn@@ ty and the power to make political cho@@ ices , instead of sub@@ mit@@ ting to the laws of the market , even if that means encouraging fa@@ ta@@ lis@@ m , that dead@@ ly enem@@ y of democracy .
in other words , to achieve those objectives , Europe is also a relevant level , a level at which it is appropriate to promote the rights of workers , citizens , members of Parliament and the public authorities to access information and to take action , in order to reduce the ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant power of those who ten@@ d to see themselves as modern day fe@@ ud@@ al lor@@ ds .
indeed , if there is a role that we are am@@ ply entitled to expect Europe to take on in full , it is that of responsible pla@@ yer on the world stage , determined to use its influence to bring about the introduction of a f@@ res@@ h set of rules govern@@ ing international relations .
let us consider the poten@@ ti@@ ally s@@ alu@@ tary influence of , say , a European decision expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly to ban all rec@@ our@@ se to war as a means of sol@@ ving the world &apos;s problems , so as to ensure that , from the Middle East to the C@@ auc@@ as@@ us , the force of politics pre@@ va@@ ils over the politics of force .
think of the positive influence of a decision to conclude alli@@ an@@ ces between Europe and the countries of the s@@ outh that will extend to include international financial and trade institutions , thereby tac@@ kl@@ ing head @-@ on the mur@@ der@@ ous on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of economic war ; or of a decision to establish with the United States , of course , the will to for@@ ge - with that great nation and with others - the most ambitious partnership possible , yet within a framework of total political and strategic independence .
if you har@@ bour such amb@@ itions for Europe , then perhaps some of you could tell us why , in that case , you are opposed to this draft Constitution .
you are opposed to it precisely because this text takes up provisions acc@@ u@@ mula@@ ted in particular since the Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t Treaty , in order to per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ate them , s@@ olem@@ n@@ ly and for the long term ; provisions that constitute so many obstacles to even the parti@@ al implementation of such a European project .
I refer in particular to the key principles of the open market economy in which competition is free ; to the fact that the European Central Bank can no longer have liber@@ al sta@@ tu@@ tes or a liber@@ al mission ; to the Commission &apos;s dis@@ cre@@ tionary powers as regards competition or indeed the bla@@ tant sub@@ ordin@@ ation of all European security and defence policy to the policy formed within NATO .
new provisions are added to those old ones , thereby wid@@ ening still further the g@@ ul@@ f separ@@ ating the concept of Europe that is being construc@@ ted from the one that I have just mentioned .
the draft Treaty thus contains an ar@@ ticle which calls , in the fi@@ er@@ y spirit of the multila@@ teral agreement on investments , for the remo@@ val of restrictions on foreign direct investment and of other dang@@ er@@ ously ambi@@ gu@@ ous ar@@ tic@@ les relating to life paten@@ ting or indeed to cultural diversity .
in all of these fields , what we need is not a pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da campaign that bro@@ o@@ ks no contradic@@ tion , but a fran@@ k , public , pl@@ ur@@ alist review of the experience of recent years which has led to a bre@@ ak@@ down of trust between the citizens and the European institutions .
as for the report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , it does not say a word about the part of the draft constitutional Treaty de@@ voted to the policies and functioning of the Union , which in fact accounts for two thir@@ ds of the whole text .
we are therefore opposed to this report , just as we are opposed to the draft Constitutional Treaty itself .
once again , however , I wish to make it clear that the &apos; no &quot; that many of us are saying is open to alternative sugges@@ tions .
it is a European &apos; no . &quot;
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is one word mis@@ sing from this Constitution , and that word is &apos; soverei@@ gn@@ ty . &quot;
it has been re@@ placed by the word &apos; id@@ entity , &quot; which is not at all the same thing .
in the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , as we well know , there are peoples who have strong id@@ ent@@ ities and who rightly claim soverei@@ gn@@ ty , such as the Palestin@@ ians , the Iraq@@ is and many others .
in Europe , there will now be peoples who , at a time when they are at risk of los@@ ing their id@@ ent@@ ities with Turkey set to join the EU , will lose their soverei@@ gn@@ ty when the Constitution comes into force .
one word has dis@@ appe@@ ared , the word &apos; soverei@@ gn@@ ty , &quot; and another has appe@@ ared , the word &apos; law , &quot; European law , a word that is the very sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of national democra@@ cies .
there is therefore going to be a European law , h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th on a higher legal level than national laws , even constitutional laws .
our Constitution , therefore , for each of our peoples , will become the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of the internal regulations of a region of Europe .
this European , sup@@ ran@@ ational law will from now on be adopted by majority and not unanim@@ ously .
there is therefore no longer any opportunity for a particular people to voice its opposition , even if this is a matter of def@@ ending its vital interests .
thirdly , this sup@@ ran@@ ational European law will be drawn up by a Brussels bureauc@@ racy that has had the at@@ tribu@@ tes of a State con@@ fer@@ red on it .
that bureauc@@ racy is becoming a full @-@ scale international pla@@ yer , with the right to conclude international agreements , with a minis@@ ter for foreign affairs ; those words do not li@@ e .
it will enjo@@ y the transfer to its re@@ mit of the powers of a super@@ state - the capacity to draw up laws , to define public services and to address matters relating to immigration and borders .
at the same time - and this will be my last point - national democra@@ cies will be tra@@ m@@ pl@@ ed under@@ foot .
national parliaments are having their capacity to make laws remo@@ ved from them .
to compensa@@ te for this , they have been given the right to del@@ iv@@ er opinions .
.
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for under@@ taking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very di@@ ver@@ se institution and au@@ g@@ ust body that this Parliament is .
however , in one sense the debate has mo@@ ved on , because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty @-@ ratification process that takes place in the Member States .
it is up to the people to determin@@ e what the level of debate and discussion and the final ver@@ dic@@ t on this Constitutional Treaty will be .
many times when we speak about the issues involved , in s@@ pite of our best efforts , some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed .
therefore , we are fighting the next argument rather than dealing with the current debate .
in addition , when you lis@@ ten to some of the debate , it is like going back to the future , because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first tre@@ aties in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , and to the second and subsequ@@ ent tre@@ aties in the 197@@ 0@@ s and 198@@ 0@@ s , are being re@@ has@@ hed .
people are saying that this is the pro@@ ph@@ et of do@@ om and g@@ loo@@ m about to come and join us and take our power away .
let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it .
as a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future , it is a very good document .
it en@@ su@@ res there will be proper respect and trust for the Member States and for their ro@@ les within it , in particular for the small@@ er Member States ; it clearly s@@ ets down in the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine of con@@ fer@@ ral who has the power to do what and where the lines of dem@@ ar@@ cation are drawn .
when the people who op@@ pose this Treaty and have opposed other tre@@ aties say that this will over@@ r@@ ide national law , this issue has already been decided .
back in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s in the European Court of Justice , the prim@@ acy of European law over national law was brought into being .
however , the Treaty clearly defin@@ es that and n@@ ar@@ ro@@ ws down that role , namely that it only oper@@ ates for European law .
the European institutions and European law@@ ma@@ kers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law .
so let us have a real and hon@@ est debate .
let us move away from the lies , the fear and s@@ car@@ em@@ ong@@ ering that takes place .
some people will be justified in oppos@@ ing this Treaty because of their political beli@@ ef@@ s , ide@@ olog@@ ies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States .
but let us ensure that the debate is based on fact , truth and the written text and not on mis@@ concep@@ tions .
Mr President , though this House , in self @-@ congratula@@ tory e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia , will emb@@ ra@@ ce this Constitution , than@@ k@@ fully the ultima@@ te decision res@@ ts with the Member States .
it is their votes that really matter .
what I des@@ p@@ ise most is the fal@@ se pre@@ tence , particularly pre@@ val@@ ent in the United Kingdom , that this Constitution is merely a ti@@ d@@ ying @-@ up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will sett@@ le the constitutional sha@@ pe of Europe for gener@@ ations .
that is demonstra@@ bly fal@@ se .
those who pe@@ d@@ dle that dec@@ ep@@ tion are best ex@@ posed by the Constitution &apos;s own most ar@@ d@@ ent and more hon@@ est pro@@ pon@@ ents .
in the Constitutional Affairs Committee , I have obser@@ ved at first hand the strategy and schem@@ ing of ar@@ ch Euro@@ ph@@ il@@ es .
they make no sec@@ ret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself , but a work in progress and they do nothing to conc@@ e@@ al their amb@@ ition to have it , in their terms , strength@@ ened at the first opportunity - without , of course , the tro@@ ub@@ l@@ es@@ ome obsta@@ cle of further national consultation .
their un@@ dis@@ gu@@ ised cand@@ our gives the li@@ e to those who would dec@@ eive vo@@ ters into thinking that this is a m@@ ere ti@@ d@@ ying @-@ up exercise : it is not .
the choice for the nation @-@ states is this : a choice between a Europe of co@@ operating soverei@@ g@@ n nation @-@ states , or a Europe that is itself a super@@ state .
despite all the den@@ i@@ als , this Constitution is a framework for super@@ sta@@ te@@ ho@@ od .
it declar@@ es its su@@ pre@@ ma@@ cy over national constitu@@ tions ; it proc@@ la@@ im@@ s the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ence of national law ; it ap@@ points its own presid@@ ent and foreign minis@@ ter .
it re@@ leg@@ ates national parliaments to m@@ ere consul@@ ta@@ tive s@@ oun@@ ding bo@@ ards ; it tra@@ des mean@@ ing@@ ful democracy for the p@@ se@@ ud@@ o @-@ democracy of this House ; it neu@@ ters the last defence of the nation @-@ state by increasingly sup@@ plan@@ ting the national ve@@ to with ra@@ dic@@ ally increased qualified majority voting ; and it provides an un@@ br@@ id@@ led path to further integration by per@@ mit@@ ting amendment by head@@ s of government rather than by the people .
anyone with pr@@ ide in his or her own nation , who does not want to see it sub@@ sum@@ ed into a h@@ ide@@ ous con@@ g@@ l@@ om@@ er@@ ate , will reject this ta@@ w@@ d@@ ry Constitution .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what we have been given here is a Constitutional Treaty foun@@ ded on the work of a Convention com@@ posed largely of parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans , and , as it was they who made this bre@@ ak@@ through possible , the development of Europe is no longer in the hands of diplom@@ ats .
n@@ in@@ ety per cent of the draft produced by the Convention then w@@ ent through the Intergovernmental Conference , and I believe that it was this method , involving the peoples of Europe through their elected representatives , that was crucial in terms of the progress made .
not everything in this constitution is perfec@@ t , but I think the decisive thing is that it is better than what we have at present .
this Constitutional Treaty reinfor@@ ces the citizens in their rights ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights will give them entit@@ lem@@ ents and safegu@@ ards .
it strength@@ ens citizens &quot; rights because , in future , the election of the President of the Commission will be directly dependent on the votes of the European Parliament .
the public &apos;s hand is strength@@ ened both by the referendum and by exten@@ ding the rights of the European Parliament .
this Constitution has become more transparent , because it makes the alloc@@ ation of powers and responsibilities cle@@ ar@@ er , thereby making procedures more read@@ ily comprehen@@ sible , and because the Council is , at least when taking decisions on law@@ making , required to meet in public .
the extension of majority decision @-@ making may well not be sufficient , but it is considerable , and it does make the European Union more efficient , something that is appar@@ ent in other areas , for example , in the remo@@ val of the pill@@ ars structure and the introduction of a single legal person@@ ality , and , in particular , in the substantial improvements made in the fields of foreign , security and defence policies .
our Europe is foun@@ ded upon values .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which I regard as drawing to a high degree on the Christian concep@@ tion of what human@@ ity is , is - or so I believe - one of its won@@ ders .
having been draf@@ ted by a previous Convention , the mar@@ ve@@ ll@@ ous thing about it now is that so many peoples can take such a common basis of values as their gu@@ ide and that those who make our laws in future must look to see that these values are ad@@ her@@ ed to - and this is leg@@ ally binding rather than a matter of policy .
we want this Europe of ours to be a community , and that is what the Convention wanted .
now , as we move to make the Constitution work , we have to atta@@ ch high priority to what the Convention wanted being re@@ tained , without it being al@@ tered by a tech@@ no@@ c@@ ratic approach to its implementation .
even now , we have a Foreign Ser@@ vice on which to prac@@ t@@ ise , and we are constantly hear@@ ing of attemp@@ ts already being made in the cor@@ rid@@ ors of countries &quot; foreign minis@@ tries to con@@ test the Commission &apos;s powers - and hence also those of the European Community and its Parliament - as a means towards establishing a new inter@@ governmental authority .
in the way it is represented ab@@ road , too , the European Union is a Community , and we see this in its foreign relations , in development and in many other areas of activity , and this must not be changed by the tech@@ no@@ c@@ ratic way these are shared out in a foreign service .
here we have f@@ ought to secure substantial rights for the Commission , without whose con@@ sent nothing happens , and I would point out to it and to the Council that we will keep a very close e@@ ye on this .
the way in which Europe &apos;s powers and responsibilities are or@@ der@@ ed makes clear that those powers and responsibilities are con@@ fer@@ red by the Member States , and it is for this reason that all this talk of a super@@ state is complete n@@ on@@ sense .
the fact is that soverei@@ gn@@ ty continues to be ves@@ ted in the Member States , and every competence not expres@@ s@@ ly defined as being European remains with them .
in this respect , this Constitution sur@@ pass@@ es anything else we have had ; as the op@@ pon@@ ents of a super@@ state ar@@ gue that Nice is worse , it is they who must surely be in favour of the Constitution .
that is the truth of the matter , and so I would ask Mr A@@ ll@@ is@@ ter and Mr de V@@ ill@@ i@@ ers to take an open @-@ min@@ ded look at the way things are and not tell their vo@@ ters and the public things that are not true .
this Europe seeks to po@@ ol soverei@@ gn@@ ty where we as individual states are too wea@@ k to go it alone .
what this means is that we do not want to take soverei@@ gn@@ ty away ; on the contrary , we want to rec@@ laim it for our citizens where we cannot act otherwise .
now that the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi has struc@@ k , we can see that the nation @-@ states can no longer help on their own , because it is beyond us , and that is why our peoples need to be given additional streng@@ th through our standing together in order to have a chance of sur@@ vi@@ val in this glob@@ alised world order .
that , after all , is the whole point of this European enterpris@@ e , whose traditional objective has been to make war in Europe impossible - an objective of which we must not lose si@@ ght .
at the same time , the citizens , states and peoples must re@@ tain their own id@@ ent@@ ities .
in the future , too , I would like , as a German , to be able to get ang@@ ry when we lose at fo@@ ot@@ b@@ all to the Dutch .
we want to re@@ tain our id@@ entity .
it is in diversity that our we@@ alth is to be found .
that cannot mean , though , that we do not take joint action in situations in which our streng@@ th depen@@ ds on our standing together .
we should see to it that the Constitution is success@@ fully rati@@ fied .
domestic , day @-@ to @-@ day policy must not be allowed to decide how the Member States and their parties han@@ dle the ratification process ; what is , instead , decisive is the historic moment , in which it will become appar@@ ent where the sta@@ te@@ sm@@ en are in the Member States , moving the process of ratification forward .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o on their out@@ standing report .
this Constitution is indeed our bab@@ y , and even if it does have a few f@@ laws , there are no i@@ f@@ s or bu@@ ts in our commitment to it .
we want it to gro@@ w and f@@ lou@@ rish .
let me say , secondly , that the greatest challenge for the European Union is not Turkish membership in twenty years &quot; time , but the ratification of the European Constitution in two .
it is by that that history will jud@@ ge us , and - let me say - not just the politicians , but also the peoples of Europe .
I have confidence in the peoples &quot; intellig@@ ence , and in that of their parliaments .
in two years &quot; time , the Constitution will be in place .
after all , what will happen if it is not ?
those who believe that the status qu@@ o under the Treaty of Nice will continue to pre@@ va@@ il in Europe are han@@ ker@@ ing after an ill@@ u@@ sion .
Europe will not sha@@ ke itself down into a cor@@ e Europe and a f@@ rin@@ ge Europe , either ; on the contrary , without a European Constitution , the European Union will de@@ gener@@ ate into a pat@@ ch@@ work Europe , conf@@ using the public at home and destro@@ ying Europe &apos;s credibility in the e@@ yes of the world .
it would be cris@@ s @-@ c@@ ros@@ sed by the a@@ x@@ es and alli@@ an@@ ces of what would claim to be strategic part@@ ner@@ ships .
if the Constitution fail@@ s , we will re@@ ver@@ t to a Europe of plo@@ ts and counter @-@ plo@@ ts , the old Europe , and it is precisely that that we do not want .
the Constitution brings to an end t@@ wel@@ ve years of inter@@ mit@@ tent reform , which have taken us from Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t to Nice via Amster@@ dam and from 12 to 15 , and then to 25 , Member States .
now at last , Europe can again give its full attention to the political challenges of the twenty @-@ first century , which are enormous .
we do , though , have a new basis on which to do this .
the 25 different peoples , all of whom want to re@@ tain their id@@ entity - and will do so - who ro@@ b@@ bed and mur@@ der@@ ed each other , w@@ aged war on each other and laid each other waste for cen@@ tu@@ ries ; these 25 peoples are now in@@ dis@@ s@@ olu@@ bly un@@ iting their political des@@ tin@@ ies .
no such thing has been done before in Europe &apos;s history or that of the world .
that is what makes our fight for this constitution so wor@@ th@@ while .
let me say , four@@ th@@ ly , that European uni@@ fication was , for fif@@ ty years , an in@@ ward @-@ looking aff@@ air , foc@@ us@@ sing on the accession and integration of new Member States .
from now on , it must look ou@@ tw@@ ards .
Europe is not a world power , but it does have a world power &apos;s responsibility , and that responsibility we have to be able to live up to .
the twenty @-@ first century will present Europeans with im@@ men@@ se challenges : glob@@ alised business and financial flo@@ ws , international terrorism , climate change and the disas@@ ters associated with it , and the f@@ low of mi@@ grants .
a new world order is coming into being - not in ten years &quot; time , but now !
econom@@ ically speaking , Europe is - still - a global pla@@ yer .
politically speaking , we are in the regional le@@ ag@@ ue .
if we Europeans do not face up to these challenges now , we will be ex@@ iting the stage of world history - politically at first , and then - ine@@ vi@@ tably - econom@@ ically .
that is not the Europe for us to leave to our children .
Europe &apos;s response to globalisation is the un@@ ity of its peoples .
that is our response to the challenges of the twenty @-@ first century .
let me conclude by saying that the Constitution provides two guid@@ ing li@@ ghts for the European Union &apos;s actions in the future .
in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Constitution aff@@ ir@@ ms that the EU exists not only to guarantee the freedoms of the market , but also so that the citizens may enjo@@ y the freedoms to which they are entitled .
Article 3 of the Constitution comm@@ its the EU to working towards peace , security and the sustainable development of the ear@@ th , thus aff@@ ir@@ ming that the Union be@@ ars responsibility for our plan@@ et rather than existing for its own sa@@ ke .
freedom for human@@ ity and responsibility for the world - from these gro@@ ws the new Europe &apos;s id@@ entity .
. - Mr President , the American pub@@ lic@@ ist J@@ er@@ em@@ y Ri@@ f@@ kin recently w@@ ro@@ te a bo@@ o@@ k about the European Union and entitled it &apos; The European D@@ re@@ am . &quot;
I am grateful to the President for making it possible for Mr Ri@@ f@@ kin to be with us this afternoon , and for giving us the opportunity to discuss with him the future of Europe and of the European ide@@ al .
this bo@@ o@@ k is a da@@ zz@@ ling analysis of the achiev@@ ements and innova@@ tions of fif@@ ty years of European uni@@ fication , which are truly uni@@ que and to be found no@@ where else in the world : direct elections in 25 countries to one parliament ; a court of law capable of han@@ ding down r@@ ul@@ ings for all citizens and all states ; one single currency in t@@ wel@@ ve countries , enab@@ ling us to defend our economic soverei@@ gn@@ ty at a time of globalisation ; and , now , a European constitution on the table before us .
this is something of which Europeans should be pro@@ ud ; they really should take great pr@@ ide in what has been achieved .
it is , however , g@@ lar@@ ingly appar@@ ent that such a e@@ up@@ hor@@ ic analysis is the product of obser@@ vation from outside Europe , for the European Union e@@ vo@@ kes as@@ ton@@ is@@ hment and ad@@ mi@@ ration from around the world : in Africa - having heard President M@@ be@@ ki &apos;s speech to this House , we know what expectations are placed in Europe ; in Asia , where Europe is giving extra@@ ordinary help to deal with the present disaster ; and also in America , both North and South .
I sometimes wish there were less small @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness , less fe@@ ar@@ ful@@ ness and less sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism within the European Union .
rather than being af@@ ra@@ id of the project of European uni@@ fication , we should hold our head@@ s high with pr@@ ide .
we are a model , and a model secu@@ red by the European Constitution .
some of Europe &apos;s dre@@ am@@ s have already come true .
we still have work to do on the others .
as has already been said , the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers &quot; great dre@@ am was that , after a mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um of war , peace would at last be res@@ to@@ red to the continent , and the EU is the greatest peace project in the world .
many peoples have l@@ ong@@ ed for freedom and democracy .
let me say it again : the EU is the greatest peace project that there has ever been on this continent .
many of those around us find the EU very at@@ trac@@ tive and want to join it .
some dre@@ am@@ s , though , have not come true in a time such as this , in which crime , terrorism and the challenges of globalisation are g@@ na@@ wing away at the European Social Mo@@ del .
I believe we will be better able to make the dre@@ am of prosperity and security a reality with this Constitution than without it .
such are the big issues that have to be expla@@ ined to people every@@ where over the coming ei@@ gh@@ teen months , as ratification is deb@@ ated in the twenty @-@ five countries .
the Europeans &quot; great dre@@ am , the long @-@ term goals of this European project and the values that under@@ p@@ in it : these are what we must commun@@ icate , and we must not allow ourselves to get lost in tri@@ via or details .
one Member on my committee once said that we must not now coun@@ t the individual tre@@ es , the 4@@ 48 ar@@ tic@@ les , and pic@@ k out one ; instead we must look at the whole w@@ o@@ od , the project as a whole .
it is then that we come to the conclusion that this is a great lea@@ p forward , from a union of states to a union of citizens , from diplom@@ atic Europe to a democratic Europe .
nothing is set in st@@ one , and there will of course be more sta@@ ges to European uni@@ fication .
that is what we should be saying to all those who are not yet satisfied .
I want to thank Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o for producing a really good report , which will prepare this House for dialogue with our partners in the national parliaments and the citizens of twenty @-@ five countries .
I am glad that the European Constitution ow@@ es much to this House , from Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i &apos;s &apos; C@@ ro@@ co@@ d@@ ile C@@ lu@@ b &quot; to the European Constitution Inter@@ group in the previous and present legislative perio@@ ds , in which many Members have worked to achieve progress in this area .
we re@@ jo@@ ice and are glad that this draft is now on the table .
we must now do everything possible to ensure that this draft becomes reality rather than existing only in b@@ lack and wh@@ ite .
there have already been two draf@@ ts ; this third attempt at a European Constitution must see the light of day .
if , tomorrow , we vote for the Constitution by a large majority , everyone will go out and fight for it .
Europe &apos;s friends must not let this historic opportunity be taken out of their hands .
we must not leave the field to its op@@ pon@@ ents , who will lead their countries and peoples into is@@ ol@@ ation and down a political cu@@ l @-@ de @-@ sa@@ c .
.
Mr President , Parliament &apos;s Committee on Development expressed decisive support for the constitutional text , in the beli@@ ef that it represents historic progress by establishing solidarity with those who need it most , development cooperation and responsibility in humanitarian assistance , wh@@ er@@ ever it is required , as defin@@ ing character@@ is@@ tics of the European Union .
in the opinion of the Committee on Development , we call for mo@@ bil@@ isation so that the Constitution can be rati@@ fied and can enter into force as soon as possible , and for that mo@@ bil@@ isation to involve those institutions , NGOs and individuals in Europe who have made North @-@ South solidarity a fundamental cause within our political s@@ tru@@ gg@@ le and our social commitment .
let us remember , therefore , that the Constitution makes these values of solidarity and cooperation and humanitarian responsibility the European Union &apos;s dist@@ ing@@ uis@@ hing mar@@ ks and that , accord@@ ingly , they must trans@@ c@@ end all policies and gu@@ ide all Community actions .
the Constitution also means that , in the future , the European Union will have the legal person@@ ality we have la@@ c@@ ked and which will allow us to act as a Union on the international stage and particularly within the re@@ al@@ m of the United Nations .
in this way , we will be making considerable progress with regard to representa@@ tiveness , responsibility , efficiency and potential , which are particularly important in terms of the European Union &apos;s presence and work in the countries of the developing world and in the field of development cooperation .
let us not forget that the er@@ ad@@ ication of poverty in the world is expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly laid down as one of the European Union &apos;s constitutional objectives .
we will end - though this is of particular rele@@ van@@ ce given the current circumstances in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asia - by stres@@ sing that the Constitution provides for the creation of a European body of volun@@ te@@ ers for humanitarian actions , thereby demonstra@@ ting its considerable ti@@ m@@ elin@@ ess and capacity for anti@@ ci@@ pation .
. Mr President , in the area of trade policy , this Constitution pu@@ ts the European Parliament in a much str@@ onger position .
when , as was for@@ mer@@ ly the case , the European Parliament &apos;s democratic control did not extend to trade policy , that gave rise to constan@@ t criticism .
this House did not even have to be consul@@ ted when the autonom@@ ous trade legislation was adopted .
in future , necessary measures will have to be laid down by European acts and framework legislation , so , in principle , Parliament will participate as an equal .
that is something in which we should take great satisfac@@ tion .
it is still , however , a source of an@@ gu@@ ish that it has still not yet been possible to make qualified majority voting the nor@@ m in the Council .
on this , the Convention was more advan@@ ced than the Intergovernmental Conference .
nevertheless , this Constitution makes for greater consisten@@ cy in the trade policy matters that we have been dealing with within the WTO ever since the U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay round .
this Constitution pu@@ ts the European Union on a better legal fo@@ o@@ ting for conduc@@ ting negotiations .
.
Mr President , for those of us who work to ensure that the Union &apos;s economic resources are well spent , this is a good day : all spending is going to be subject to greater democratic control by Parliament and the Council , and efficiency in spending is going to increase , because govern@@ ability is being increased : we are re@@ pla@@ cing v@@ et@@ o@@ es with democracy .
that means we are going to be able to spen@@ d better ; and if the resources the citizens contribute are better spent , we will have more authority to ask for more resources in order to implement the policies the citizens are deman@@ ding of the European Union .
it is , therefore , a great day , a day for being happy to say &apos; yes , &quot; at a time when , through this Constitution , we are bringing the European project to fru@@ ition after fif@@ ty years .
this Constitution brings much progress with it ; nevertheless , as our Group President , Mr Poettering , quite rightly said , it is la@@ cking certain things .
we have been ti@@ mid in terms of acknowled@@ ging our Christian ro@@ ots , we have been ti@@ mid in recogn@@ ising the obvious .
we have just cel@@ e@@ bra@@ ted Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas ; this Parliament will stop at E@@ as@@ ter ; here in Strasbourg the most important building is not a building like this one , but a medi@@ e@@ val building , a ca@@ th@@ ed@@ ral .
perhaps we have been victi@@ m to a degree of in@@ toler@@ ant sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism , but Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas , E@@ as@@ ter and the Strasbourg Ca@@ th@@ ed@@ ral will still be there and there are many aspects we have been able to improve .
we must , therefore , say &apos; yes , &quot; because we believe in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolve the daily problems of the citizens .
we are going to do so in the best way : by spending better , contro@@ lling our spending better and having more democratic and effective policies .
our group and I personally say yes to the Constitution .
Mr President , there was a large majority of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who voted in favour of the new draft Constitution .
we did so not because we thought that the proposal was perfec@@ t in all res@@ pects .
indeed , we should like to see more decisions with qualified majority voting in the social area .
I myself should like to see opportunities exist for cross @-@ border union rights .
we voted in favour because this proposal in the social area is better than the current proposal .
we must not turn the best into the enem@@ y of the good when we jud@@ ge the new draft Constitution .
let me give a few examples of improvements .
firstly , the objective of full employment .
this is the first time we have this objective in any draft for the new Constitution .
secondly , the social clause in Par@@ t I@@ II , which obli@@ ges the EU to meet the social objectives in all the areas of competence .
thirdly , the fundamental rights in the Charter of C@@ itiz@@ ens &quot; Rights , which also includes union rights .
four@@ th@@ ly , the strengthening of the social partners &quot; role through recognition of the signific@@ ance of the social dialogue and tri@@ alogue .
fif@@ th@@ ly , the emphasis upon the balance between employment policy and ma@@ cro@@ economic policy .
si@@ x@@ th@@ ly , the introduction of a legal basis for services of general economic interest .
se@@ ven@@ th@@ ly , the fact that EU citizens are now able to take initiatives .
the new draft Constitution would make the EU more open , more efficient and more democratic .
for ourselves who defend the social model , it is quite easy to support the new draft Constitution because it includes a long list of improvements which will signific@@ antly improve the opportunities for developing the social model in the future .
. - Mr President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Fo@@ od S@@ af@@ ety has adopted a position with regard to the Constitution , of which I shall highlight the following s@@ ali@@ ent points : we welcome the fact that the implementation of the three pill@@ ars of sustainable development is among the Union &apos;s objectives and that environmental integration and a high level of protection for human beings have been recognised .
it is a p@@ ity that the third part relating to the Union &apos;s policies and functioning does not ta@@ lly with the principle of sustainable development , within the scope of the policies on agriculture , cohesion , transport and trade .
certain environmental measures - such as those relating to tax , to@@ wn planning , qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive water management and land use - could be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure , but instead are still adopted unanim@@ ously by the Council .
we welcome the adoption of measures aimed at atta@@ ining high standards of quality and safety of medicines and me@@ dical de@@ vic@@ es .
measures relating to sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance and early war@@ ning systems in the fight against serious cross @-@ border health thre@@ ats are also a step in the right direction .
such measures form part of the EU &apos;s shared powers and are therefore subject to the ordinary legislative procedure .
we welcome the introduction of a c@@ hap@@ ter on democratic life in the Union , and the principle where@@ by these positions must be taken as transpar@@ ently as possible and in the manner that is clos@@ est to the citizens .
furthermore , we should like to highlight the importance of the Community institutions &quot; responsibility towards the public , and public access to the cour@@ ts and other relevant organisations , not least in the field of the environment .
personally , Mr President , I feel that the next step is to dis@@ cover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure ; how this Constitution , which has been created in a somewhat top @-@ down fas@@ hi@@ on , will be received and experienc@@ ed from the bo@@ tto@@ m up@@ wards ; and how the principle of equality between States and the Community method will be stric@@ tly guaranteed in practice .
only history will be able to tell us .
. Mr President , although Mr Le@@ inen has en@@ join@@ ed us to consider the whole for@@ est of the Constitution , and not just individual tre@@ es , I must , as spo@@ kes@@ man for the Committee on Industry , give brief attention to the tre@@ es of industrial policy , some of which I might wish would gro@@ w better than the Constitution makes provision for .
some significant progress has , though , been made .
the example I would like to give is that of space policy , for which Europe now has additional powers ; it may well not sound either particularly every@@ day or convinc@@ ing , but I am not talking about us compet@@ ing with the Americ@@ ans or the Rus@@ si@@ ans or the C@@ hin@@ ese or anyone else in sen@@ ding our man - or w@@ oman - to the mo@@ on or to M@@ ars .
rather , what I am talking about is our making use of the means of information affor@@ ded by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also around the g@@ lo@@ be .
consider , then , the great disaster that we now have to deal with : we need better information and war@@ ning systems , and Europe has the technology to provide them .
consider the day @-@ to @-@ day problems and tasks in connection with information and na@@ vi@@ gation that our Galileo has to deal with , and , finally , let us give thought to security policy .
we cannot de@@ plo@@ y our tro@@ op@@ s without the information they need being provided from space .
if we want a proper policy of military security around the world , then we also need a proper space policy , with an emphasis on civil@@ ian and peaceful use , and for that the Constitution provides additional pos@@ sibilities .
for that reason , the Industry Committee , too , fully and wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ tedly supports the European Constitution .
.
Mr President , it goes without saying that I must begin by congratula@@ ting the rapporteurs on their excellent report .
I have had the hon@@ our of being draf@@ t@@ sman of the opinion for this report for the Committee on Regional Development and I would like to say that the debate on this issue has been very positive and inten@@ se , because , amongst other things , we must remember the essential role played by regional and local administra@@ tions in European integration .
and it is also essential to remember that the European Constitution recogn@@ ises local and regional autonom@@ y as an integra@@ l part of the national id@@ entity of the Member States .
this means that , amongst other things , the European Constitution guarantees the in@@ viol@@ ability of the current borders of the States making up the current European Union .
today , however , on the subject of the Constitution and the regions , I would also like to condemn the fact that , in a region of Europe , a Spanish region , the Bas@@ que Coun@@ try , the exclu@@ sive nation@@ alist government of that A@@ ut@@ onom@@ ous Community wants to implement a rup@@ tur@@ ist , sec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist and independ@@ ent@@ ist plan , the I@@ bar@@ ret@@ x@@ e P@@ l@@ an , which is a direct attack on the Spanish Constitution and the European Constitution .
because I@@ bar@@ ret@@ x@@ e and his government , who call themselves democ@@ rats , have made a p@@ act with the mur@@ der@@ ers of ET@@ A and B@@ a@@ ta@@ su@@ n@@ a to bring this plan into being ; they have made a p@@ act with an organisation which is on the European Union &apos;s list of terrorist groups , B@@ a@@ ta@@ su@@ n@@ a , and the Bas@@ que Na@@ tion@@ alist Party has made a p@@ act and an alli@@ ance with crimin@@ als , with mur@@ der@@ ers : in short , with the enem@@ ies of Europe .
at this point , I am convinced that this Constitution is also going to put an end to independ@@ ent@@ ist , rup@@ tur@@ ist and sec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist proposals such as the I@@ bar@@ ret@@ x@@ e P@@ l@@ an and I am sure that the new Constitution will represent an in@@ sur@@ moun@@ table obsta@@ cle to this I@@ bar@@ ret@@ x@@ e P@@ l@@ an and to any@@ body who wants to dis@@ member the European Union .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ever since the ad@@ v@@ ent of the common agricultural policy ne@@ arly half a century ago , the European Parliament has been little more than a consul@@ ta@@ tive body when it comes to the making of laws .
right up to now , the Council has been able to take decisions without reference to Parliament , and over half the European Union &apos;s Budget is dis@@ posed of without any democratic control .
this is something that the European Parliament , and the Committee on Agriculture in particular , have never accepted .
u@@ no@@ ffici@@ ally , we have found ways of dela@@ ying final votes as a means of for@@ cing the Council into a sort of codecision .
we have also done ster@@ ling work on hand@@ ling such cris@@ es as BSE , which means that our being conc@@ ed@@ ed codecision in principle is something we have , to some extent , ear@@ ned , and that is something we welcome .
it has to be clear to us , though , that a number of points remain to be rec@@ ti@@ fied .
in one ar@@ ticle in particular , the Council has reser@@ ved to itself the right to vote on quo@@ ta@@ s , prices and restrictions on qu@@ ant@@ ity , without , this time , consul@@ ting Parliament at all .
we still , then , have much to do in the future .
we will still have to draw on our cre@@ ative powers in order to exer@@ t our democratic influence in these matters and in getting it stated , in principle , that agricultural policy will be subject to codecision .
if it is , though , Parliament will be given more responsibility , and I hope that this House will continue , as before , to give the interests of agriculture and of rural areas the attention they deser@@ ve .
.
Mr President , Members of the Committee on Fisheries are well at@@ tun@@ ed to opinion in Europe &apos;s coas@@ tal and is@@ land communities .
that committee , in a ne@@ ar unanim@@ ous decision , endor@@ sed my opinion on this Constitution .
the most important paragraph in that opinion , which will be re@@ tabled tomorrow for voting as Amendment No 13 on behalf of my Group , ref@@ ers to exclu@@ sive competence .
it &apos; considers that within the context of the other exclu@@ sive competences of the EU , which are detailed in the Constitution , the inclu@@ sion of the con@@ ser@@ vation of mar@@ ine bi@@ ological resources is anom@@ al@@ ous and un@@ justified &apos; .
the common fisheries policy has not been one of the European Union &apos;s success s@@ tor@@ ies .
decision @-@ making is too cen@@ tr@@ alised , too inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble and too remo@@ te from the communities that it affec@@ ts .
to entr@@ en@@ ch the C@@ F@@ P effectively in primary constitutional law is a major step in the wrong direction and one that will - I believe - be an obsta@@ cle to the kind of major reforms deman@@ ded by the fishing communities that I am fam@@ ili@@ ar with .
exclu@@ sive competence takes the C@@ F@@ P out@@ with the principle of subsidiarity , ensuring that regional advis@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ils can never ev@@ ol@@ ve into management bodies .
I hope that colleagues will support Amendment No 13 tomorrow and support the fishing communities , as the Fisheries Committee of this Parliament has done .
these communities strongly believe that exclu@@ sive competence is not only un@@ necessary but is indeed anom@@ al@@ ous and un@@ justified .
. Mr President , I too would like to warm@@ ly congratulate both rapporteurs , particularly on the way in which they struc@@ tu@@ red their report , in which there is little room for us on the Legal Affairs Committee to make further improvements , although what we have proposed has been incorpor@@ ated , and for that I am very grateful .
we , in the Legal Affairs Committee , will , though , be dealing with the issues of special interest to us in an own @-@ initiative report , particularly the reform of legal instruments and of the law@@ making process , the principles of subsidiarity and propor@@ tion@@ ality , and the innova@@ tions in the justice system .
I believe that another issue that will demand our attention in the future is that of how we can guarantee coher@@ ence between parts I and I@@ II of the Constitution .
this opinion by the Legal Affairs Committee does of course concentra@@ te on the re@@ arrang@@ ement of the Union &apos;s instruments of action , of which there is at present a ver@@ itable ple@@ th@@ or@@ a : the Convention coun@@ ted 35 different types of them .
I would like to pay tribu@@ te to its V@@ ice @-@ President , G@@ i@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ o A@@ ma@@ to , who achieved great things as chairman of the Wor@@ king Group on S@@ imp@@ li@@ fication , something that all those present who were involved in that Wor@@ king Group will be able to confirm .
they can all , in any case , take pr@@ ide in their own contributions .
that much about this European Constitution is uni@@ que as has already been said ; I also con@@ ten@@ d that something else that is uni@@ que is the amount of simp@@ li@@ fication that this Constitution has enab@@ led us to achieve and the amount of bureauc@@ racy it has enab@@ led us to do away with .
I am thinking only of the constitutional reform processes that are going on in Austria and Germany at the moment .
I also see this as pro@@ of that the EU is not the bureauc@@ racy it is always de@@ pic@@ ted as being ; on the contrary it is very much an institution capable of re@@ form@@ ing itself and has shown itself to be more so than not a few nation states .
our legislative instruments will in future be simple and read@@ ily dist@@ ing@@ uis@@ ha@@ ble from administrative instruments - and , when the Constitution is in place , much else about our lives will be so much easier .
I also believe that , although these changes are less spec@@ tac@@ ular than some of what is going on in the institutions , they play a very important part in making the EU more democratic and bringing it closer to the people .
. - Mr President , I congratulate the Members who have drawn up this important report .
the Committee on C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties , Justice and Home Affairs found it a ple@@ asure , a great ple@@ asure , to approve the revis@@ ed con@@ ten@@ ts of the Constitutional Treaty , because several issues relating to the area of freedom , security and justice will at last be addressed in a new way in keeping with people &apos;s demands : clearly , when one talks of freedom one is talking of the most important thing in life for each one of us .
there remain , however , certain aspects - which I shall highlight - that the C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Committee examin@@ ed but which left us somewhat per@@ ple@@ xed , although without d@@ et@@ rac@@ ting from our ple@@ asure and hence our desire to have this report adopted unanim@@ ously by this Parliament .
nevertheless , the C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Committee was very pleased to issue a fav@@ ourable opinion and therefore , on behalf of the C@@ i@@ vil Liber@@ ties Committee , I call on all Members to express their approval of the Constitutional Treaty tomorrow .
Mr President , the Laeken Dec@@ lar@@ ation rightly called for the EU institutions to develop in a way which brought them closer to the people .
as the ratification process on the Constitution ga@@ th@@ ers p@@ ace , it must be said that those amb@@ itions clearly have not been realis@@ ed .
as a member of the Convention , I made great efforts to try to per@@ su@@ ade my colleagues that the emer@@ ging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe &apos;s citizens .
I argu@@ ed throughout that Europe did not need a constitution but a simp@@ lif@@ ying treaty .
that would have been enough to modern@@ ise the institutions and the work@@ ings of the Union .
I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative .
Prime Minister Bla@@ ir agreed with me then ; now he emb@@ ra@@ ces the Constitution as it has been drawn up .
there is nothing anti @-@ European in oppos@@ ing the Constitution .
however , British Con@@ serva@@ tives and other colleagues in the PPE @-@ DE Group think that it cen@@ tr@@ alis@@ es more powers , makes the institutions more remo@@ te and reduc@@ es the powers of nation @-@ states .
Europe has mis@@ sed an historic opportunity to modern@@ ise its work@@ ings to meet the demands of an enlarged and more di@@ ver@@ se Union .
a simp@@ lif@@ ying treaty could have tac@@ kl@@ ed the real issues : rela@@ tive economic dec@@ line , fraud and waste , and greater involvement of national parliaments in the decision @-@ making processes .
at a time when the gener@@ os@@ ity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi disaster is ev@@ ident to all , it is in@@ expl@@ ic@@ able why this Parliament is commit@@ ting a considerable su@@ m of money to a programme of events and rec@@ ep@@ tions in support of the European Constitution .
those funds would have been better direc@@ ted to assis@@ ting in the disaster reli@@ ef .
the Constitution is of such far @-@ reaching signific@@ ance that its rejec@@ tion in one or more of the Member States in the forthcoming referen@@ da would ren@@ der it vo@@ id .
however , rather than being totally negative , we should regard that outcome - should it occ@@ ur - as a f@@ res@@ h opportunity for us all to establish a modern Union that res@@ pects and cel@@ eb@@ rates its diversity and which is accoun@@ table by the people and from the people , rather than one which demands too much con@@ form@@ ity .
we live in a very pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar time in the history of the united Europe .
even though it is very difficult to div@@ ide the recent past into sec@@ tions , we wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed , organised and bec@@ a@@ me part of such events that clearly allow us to draw the conclusion and dec@@ l@@ are that we have ente@@ red into a new er@@ a .
today , the united Europe consis@@ ts of 25 Member States , and we know that ex@@ pan@@ sion is still in progress .
the united Europe &apos;s new face shows more and more defined character@@ is@@ tics and in order to maintain and preser@@ ve these tra@@ its , we now have a Constitution , which is the to@@ pic of today &apos;s pres@@ entation .
the Constitution prov@@ es that the united Europe will be able to meet the legal requirements of the ex@@ pan@@ sion as well .
this Constitution allows for more opportunities to make Europe become the Europe of its citizens .
the role of Parliament , whose Members are ap@@ pointed by direct election , has gro@@ wn , and we believe that the decisions made by the European Parliament and the national parliaments should and will be buil@@ t upon each other .
thus , the range of nor@@ ms that per@@ tain@@ s to the whole of the Community may extend in the long run , especially in the area of social issues .
H@@ un@@ g@@ ary had already rati@@ fied the Constitution at the end of last year .
however , this document that is on the agenda today is very important to us as well .
there have been concerns that information has been sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ously with@@ held .
I firmly believe that we do not with@@ hold information and we do not have any sec@@ re@@ ts , we have nothing to h@@ ide .
it seems as if we have to force information on the European political systems and citizens of Europe .
it requires certain knowledge to be a European citizen and to be democratic .
in the so @-@ called Lisbon process , we need to be fam@@ ili@@ ar with the nor@@ ms of the Constitution , its social nor@@ ms and also know that nor@@ ms require more and more guarantees in order to build a social Europe , strengthen solidarity and secure social toler@@ ance .
the Constitution is our basic law , but as many have said before , it is not a final document set in st@@ one .
let me mention two areas that reflect our future challenges .
firstly , the challenge of a mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural Europe .
what I mean by this is not the question of Isla@@ m , but the challenge that our Europe is religious and sec@@ ular .
secondly , the question of minority issues .
during the ratification debate , the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian parliament ur@@ ged that minority rights should be strength@@ ened in community legislation .
I believe that our common European citiz@@ en@@ ship is the key to over@@ coming discrimination and the ins@@ ec@@ urity of national id@@ entity .
let us take advantage of the opportunities provided by European citiz@@ en@@ ship !
Mr President , this part @-@ session of the European Parliament is of historic signific@@ ance .
a motion for a resolution has been tabled on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , and this House , Europe &apos;s larg@@ est democratic institution , will send an important message to the nations and citizens of Europe by adopting it .
the resolution ap@@ prov@@ es the Constitutional Treaty and calls for its ratification .
adoption of the resolution will be an opportunity for all those who believe that Europe needs a Constitution not only to gain information on the Treaty , but also to conv@@ in@@ ce Europe &apos;s citizens that it should be adopted .
in addition , I believe it will also act as an appeal to the European Commission to become involved in convinc@@ ing European citizens of the Treaty &apos;s mer@@ its .
the Constitutional Treaty has been the target of much criticism in my country , and it did not live up to all the expectations held of it .
I have no doubt that , as it stands , the Treaty makes it possible to strengthen the European Union .
firstly , both the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed there@@ in state un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ously that respect for the dignity of the human being is the basis of our common values , thus confir@@ ming the signific@@ ance of our Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o @-@ Christian her@@ ita@@ ge .
secondly , the Treaty strength@@ ens the role of the Community institutions , no@@ tably Parliament , the European Commission and the Court of Justice .
thirdly , the Treaty exten@@ ds citizens &quot; rights and cre@@ ates a European public space .
four@@ th@@ ly , the Treaty strength@@ ens the EU by creating the post of EU Foreign Minister , and it enab@@ les full continu@@ ity to be achieved by means of longer presid@@ encies , without the EU being turned into a super@@ state .
fif@@ th@@ ly , it strength@@ ens the EU as a community of states , nations and citizens , based on common values and solidarity .
this is the kind of EU we need .
two new Member States , Li@@ thu@@ ania and H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , have been the first to rati@@ fy the Constitutional Treaty .
I am sure that my country , Pol@@ and , in which the majority of citizens are in favour of adopting the Constitutional Treaty , will also demonstrate its une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cal support for the Treaty during the referendum .
I believe this should be regar@@ ded as something significant and , in its own way , symb@@ ol@@ ic .
twenty @-@ five years ago , the Pol@@ ish Sol@@ id@@ arity movement remo@@ ved the first st@@ one from the Berl@@ in W@@ all , and our German colleagues ought not to forget this .
fif@@ teen years ago , the R@@ ound T@@ able talks in Pol@@ and show@@ ed that it is possible to make the trans@@ ition from a tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian system into freedom without any dis@@ ruption to international peace .
this was the beginning of the uni@@ fication process in Europe , and the Treaty represents a great opportunity for this united Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the des@@ tin@@ y of Europe is at sta@@ ke .
I believe that I know what that means ; my fa@@ ther sur@@ vi@@ ved the b@@ attle of S@@ tal@@ ing@@ ra@@ d ; my mo@@ ther emer@@ ged from the concentra@@ tion cam@@ ps at Aus@@ ch@@ wit@@ z and D@@ ac@@ ha@@ u .
are we not all , on this continent , the products of an end@@ less succ@@ ession of per@@ pet@@ ra@@ tors and victims of c@@ eas@@ eless violence ?
that is why I insist that Europe is a promis@@ e - a promis@@ e made 60 years ago on the br@@ in@@ k of the ab@@ ys@@ s that was Aus@@ ch@@ wit@@ z , and in the ru@@ ins of Europe .
the promis@@ e was that nation@@ alism would be overcome , that democracy and the rights to freedom would be un@@ restric@@ ted and that Europe would be united politically .
our actions must be measu@@ red against that .
this Constitution , which the vas@@ t majority of Gre@@ ens will be endor@@ sing , is a great step to@@ ward this promis@@ e being kept .
it is not the end ; the tasks have not been comple@@ ted .
it is for that reason that we will be voting in favour of it , and of the report as well .
this Constitution la@@ ys the foun@@ dations of a European democracy .
it establis@@ hes the Union as a community of fundamental rights .
its policies are under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a common co@@ de of all @-@ emb@@ rac@@ ing values and objectives ; for the first time , it declar@@ es social rights to be human rights as trad@@ iti@@ on@@ ally understood .
it simp@@ lif@@ ies the Treaties , makes external actions subject to international law , makes the EU more effective and transparent , more democra@@ tically legitimate , and cre@@ ates the possibility of its citizens shar@@ ing in its decision @-@ making .
indeed , it does create something that is a Europe of citizens rather than the Europe of state chan@@ cer@@ ies that once exis@@ ted .
that is why we will be voting in favour of it , and that is why I am glad to see Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z here to hear me say that I find his critic@@ isms in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
his amendment makes no reference to democracy , even though this Constitution is in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble if Europe is to be democratic .
why does he not mention that ?
he claim@@ s that social progress is ab@@ sent , yet this Constitution , for the first time in the 200 years &quot; history of human rights , acknowled@@ ges and en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es social rights as human rights in the traditional sense of the word !
despite certain contradic@@ tions , we have , for the first time , incorpor@@ ated full employment and the social market economy in the list of this Constitution &apos;s objectives and values .
it is not true to say that we have agreed to make Europe a military power .
the whole process is highly ques@@ tion@@ able .
the issue of our relationship with NATO is as yet un@@ resolved , and , although n@@ one can surely say in what way Europe will em@@ an@@ ci@@ p@@ ate itself , we have made our actions subject to international law and to the UN Charter , while also , and for the first time , making civil conflict prevention a task imposed by the Constitution .
you cannot make things so easy for y@@ our@@ self .
I am wor@@ ried about the ratification process , but that is not what we have to get through .
when the presid@@ ent of the Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian parliament was here , when our H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian colleagues spoke , these rati@@ fications took place without any information campaign on the part of the governments and without any public debate .
is that how we want to w@@ in the Constitution ?
we will not do it that way !
we have at least n@@ ine referendu@@ ms ahead of us , and please can the rapporteurs , whom I want to congratulate and thank , allow us to say that this report is completely un@@ critical .
that pu@@ ts a question mark against the credibility of this House .
we are not the Intergovernmental Conference &apos;s court po@@ ets .
we are not here to sing the p@@ ra@@ ises of a Constitution that is not without its def@@ ec@@ ts .
we have not created a European social order .
European democracy is in@@ complete .
the s@@ hap@@ ing of a European peace framework still calls for great de@@ ed@@ s to be done , and so I would have lik@@ ed to see us not only vote by a large majority to adopt this Constitution , but also open up pros@@ pects for the contin@@ uation of the constitution @-@ making process .
we in the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance will make our contribution by setting in motion the first citizens &quot; initiative , which will demand a first amendment to the Constitution , compl@@ et@@ ing democracy , peace and the social order in Europe .
Mr President , in de@@ fi@@ ance of the resolution passed by the majority of my party , the P@@ D@@ S , and of the majority in my group , I support this Constitution .
to their &apos; no &quot; I say &apos; no . &quot;
as a soci@@ alist and a convinced European , I cannot s@@ qu@@ are rejec@@ tion of the first European Constitution with my con@@ sci@@ ence .
it was through a democratic process that it came into being , and that is itself a first in the history of the European Union ; I myself played a part in that as a member of the Convention .
let me set out the reasons that have led me to this conclusion .
for cen@@ tu@@ ries , the peoples of Europe have suffer@@ ed from imperi@@ alis@@ tic w@@ ars and b@@ itte@@ r an@@ im@@ os@@ ities .
to these we are , as we must , putting an end .
on that the Constitution s@@ ets its se@@ al .
defin@@ ing the Union as a community of values , the Constitution en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es a can@@ on of values ran@@ ging from the respect for human dignity , which is the highest good , to justice and solidarity .
all these values I coun@@ t as my own , and I want to do everything I can to see them , in their enti@@ re@@ ty , actually made real in society .
the Constitution reinfor@@ ces the rights of citizens ; it makes the EU distinc@@ tly more democratic , above all , indeed , pres@@ enting new opportunities to create a social Europe .
the Constitution substan@@ ti@@ ally advan@@ ces European integration , making the European Union as a whole better prepared to face the future .
the Constitution is signific@@ antly better than the Treaty of Nice , by which the Union is at present held together in law .
my decision also has to do with the fact that the L@@ ef@@ t , during the course of the Convention , largely re@@ fra@@ ined from contribu@@ ting any practical proposals of its own to the process , and with its failure to come up with any real alterna@@ tives to what it now re@@ jects .
I find that unacceptable .
whilst I would like to see a peaceful , democratic and social European Union and to see Europe united , this goal will el@@ ude us unless we are prepared to make conc@@ es@@ sions to one another .
I am convinced that Europe will never come into being if the political families dec@@ l@@ are their own standards to be points beyond which they will not go .
my saying &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution does not , of course , mean that I wish to g@@ los@@ s over or ignor@@ e its def@@ ec@@ ts , and I want to continue to con@@ ten@@ d for changes in the EU .
I will , of course , take up the c@@ ud@@ g@@ els against ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al policies , and I will also fight against all that ten@@ ds to turn the European Union into a military power .
my particular concern is that we must prevent the European Union from de@@ gener@@ ating into an im@@ age of the power pro@@ jec@@ ted from America , and from its being wea@@ ken@@ ed in economic and social terms by re@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment .
Mr President , a b@@ lan@@ k che@@ que is a che@@ que on which the reci@@ pi@@ ent w@@ ri@@ tes the amount concerned .
a che@@ que of this kind can be issu@@ ed in an emergency , if the sig@@ n@@ atory knows the reci@@ pi@@ ent very well .
why , however , recommen@@ d to the elector@@ ate that it endorse an agreement that is to be given substance by leaders we cannot pos@@ sibly know at present ?
we do not know whether the most important and most sensitive issues are to be decided unanim@@ ously or by qualified majority voting .
the future un@@ elected pr@@ ime ministers will themselves be able to determin@@ e how they will make decisions , instead of giving the elector@@ ate the last word .
nor do we know the content of important ar@@ tic@@ les in which decisions are left to the Court of Justice .
in one place , a ple@@ d@@ ge is given on matters relating to countries &quot; social systems ; elsewhere , our welfare systems can be voted away on the basis of a majority decision or a judg@@ ment .
in one place , the status of the national ch@@ ur@@ ch is maintained ; elsewhere , the preced@@ ence taken by the Danish Constitution in matters relating to the national ch@@ ur@@ ch is remo@@ ved .
in one place , national id@@ entity is guaranteed ; elsewhere , the Constitution has to give way if it is in conflict with a decision by officials in Brussels .
in Article I@@ II @-@ 3@@ 75 , the Danish Su@@ pre@@ me Court los@@ es the right to decide the limits placed upon the EU authorities .
in many places , there is freedom of choice as to whether a binding decision or voluntary coordination is to be used .
thus , we do not know what we are sup@@ posed to endorse .
it is therefore w@@ is@@ es@@ t not to endorse anything until the amount is stated on the che@@ que , together with the id@@ entity of the reci@@ pi@@ ent , and until we are also given the right to can@@ c@@ el the che@@ que .
in that way , we shall at least know what we are voting on and how we can over@@ turn a decision .
constitu@@ tions are for states .
between states , agreements are made , that is to say tre@@ aties .
I want to see a Europe of democra@@ cies that sol@@ ves practical problems by foc@@ using upon cross @-@ border issues , or matters that we cannot solve ourselves .
in that way , we should not be los@@ ing anything in terms of democracy , but should have everything to gain in terms of cooperation .
we should then have a democratic b@@ on@@ us instead of a growing democratic defic@@ it that might end up with the coll@@ ap@@ se of democracy .
as the well @-@ known po@@ et E@@ b@@ be K@@ l@@ ø@@ ver@@ d@@ al Re@@ ich pointed out , democracy without a is simply the exercise of power .
government that provides no opportunity for adjus@@ ting a country &apos;s course at the date of the next election is not democracy , but ol@@ ig@@ ar@@ ch@@ y .
Europe deser@@ ves better , and that is the t@@ it@@ le of the alternative statement that I recommen@@ d be adopted instead of Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t &apos;s and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z De V@@ ig@@ o &apos;s report .
- Mr President , the Convention , in which this Parliament took part , dre@@ w up a text considered at the time to be the best possible compromise .
then the Council , in turn , reached the most wor@@ ka@@ ble compromise , and the new Constitutional Treaty was signed in R@@ ome .
depen@@ ding on individual national constitu@@ tions , it is now a matter for the people , through referendu@@ ms , or for the national parliaments to give final approval to the new path .
it is a path which , like it or not , regards Europe not as a feder@@ al super@@ state that has gradu@@ ally ero@@ ded away id@@ ent@@ ities , trad@@ itions and cul@@ tures , but as a Union of soverei@@ g@@ n states that have fre@@ ely ch@@ os@@ en to brea@@ the life into a common policy .
it comes at a time in human history when natural disas@@ ters and man @-@ made tra@@ ge@@ dies require that not just the economic interests of our countries be represented on the world stage , but also the values of democracy , freedom and respect for human dignity - values that our continent has secu@@ red and set out at last after cen@@ tu@@ ries of war and conflict .
if today , in this Chamber , we div@@ ide over something that no longer depen@@ ds on our decision , but on ratification by the individual Member States and individual peoples of the Union , it will mean dis@@ avo@@ wing our Parliament &apos;s ability to plan the future and re@@ leg@@ ating it to the role of a talking sho@@ p in which pl@@ enty of fine speec@@ hes are made but little is decided .
that stands in star@@ k contr@@ ast to the increase in our pr@@ er@@ og@@ atives which , after a great s@@ tru@@ gg@@ le , we have finally achieved precisely through the draf@@ ting of the new Treaty .
it would seem appropriate to rec@@ all that , while the values and principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights now included in the second part of the Treaty form the eth@@ ical basis for the Union , several parts of the Constitutional Charter are still in@@ complete and will need up@@ d@@ ating in the light of current circumstances .
furthermore , we must ensure that the Constitution is not explo@@ ited for party @-@ political purposes against governments that have been du@@ ly elected by their own citizens .
the European Union must not run the risk of becoming a place where political groups join in b@@ attle to attack fre@@ ely made national decisions on ide@@ ological grounds .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we hear it said that the EU needs this Constitution if it wants to deep@@ en integration , but , as we have just heard from one of its most for@@ th@@ right advo@@ ca@@ tes , not everything in the draft we are to vote on is ide@@ al .
it is , appar@@ ently , better than what we had before , so this is progress in any case .
that actually s@@ oun@@ ds pre@@ tty fe@@ e@@ ble .
we are also told , though , that this Constitution will in no way facilitate the development of a European super@@ state ; on the contrary , it appar@@ ently strength@@ ens the Member States in their id@@ ent@@ ities .
if that is so , then the citizens of Europe &apos;s states should be given a real chance to have the last word in the debate on its ratification , if at all possible by means of referendu@@ ms .
for that , though , they need real information rather than just the one @-@ si@@ ded pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da cel@@ e@@ bra@@ ting the Constitution .
the Constitution &apos;s we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses , too , need to be discussed without acc@@ us@@ ations of anti @-@ Europe@@ an@@ ism being th@@ ro@@ wn around : for example , the fact that small@@ er Member States will have fe@@ wer ways to defend their interests ; the fact that the European Parliament will continue to be a to@@ oth@@ less ti@@ ger , particularly in matters affec@@ ting foreign and security policy ; and also the fact that Europe &apos;s workers are still ex@@ posed to the risk of w@@ age and social du@@ mp@@ ing .
only a fran@@ k and open debate on this Constitution &apos;s f@@ laws and dang@@ ers will make it possible for the peoples of Europe and the citizens of the EU to see it as something more than a B@@ asi@@ c La@@ w han@@ ded down from on high .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , what is at issue in today &apos;s debate on the European Constitutional Treaty ?
on the other hand , though , this treaty makes a mul@@ t@@ itude of improvements over against the tre@@ aties that we have at present , and that is the compar@@ is@@ on in which the Constitutional Treaty must come out best .
it brings us more democracy , strength@@ ens the European Parliament , and involves the national parliaments in the law@@ making process .
instead of w@@ ei@@ ghted votes , there will be du@@ al majority in the Council .
instead of more general c@@ laus@@ es , powers will be specifically con@@ fer@@ red .
the Commission is to be limited in siz@@ e , which will help to make it more democratic , and the Constitutional Treaty makes for greater transparency , which of course makes it necessary to involve the national parliaments .
before we come to decide on something at first reading , the national parliaments will be given the chance to say something about it .
not only in that it makes for transparency do I regard that as something important .
the Council will have to hold its meetings in public .
we are at last taking leave of the cl@@ an@@ des@@ tin@@ e diplom@@ acy that has character@@ ised Europe for over fif@@ ty years .
to su@@ m up , what that means to me is that the European Union will be concentra@@ ting on the tasks it can per@@ form , rather than becoming a super@@ state .
even if people still need to be more informed and more involved , this is still , on the whole , a respec@@ table treaty .
I can speak for my own party , the C@@ S@@ U , but also for our colleagues in the C@@ D@@ U , when I say that we will vote in favour of this Constitutional Treaty without any reser@@ vations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the resolution on the European Constitutional Treaty has been written in a very positive spirit .
we seem to be commen@@ ding a fla@@ w@@ less pi@@ ece of work , as if we were un@@ aware of its we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses .
we should not , however , ignor@@ e the vo@@ ices war@@ ning of the short@@ com@@ ings of the present draft Constitution .
we may decide that , despite every effort , this Constitution is neither transparent nor comprehen@@ sible .
I am also struc@@ k by the fact that the motion for a resolution does not allow for much democratic discussion , thus b@@ ran@@ ding those who have their reser@@ vations about the Treaty as anti @-@ European .
the European Constitution is a practical instrument that will affect European integration for dec@@ ad@@ es to come .
Europe can set out on the road either towards a bureauc@@ ratic feder@@ alist super@@ state , or towards the political opposite , a liber@@ al and competitive Europe .
let us make it quite clear that adopting or fail@@ ing to adopt the European Constitution is a pre@@ domin@@ antly political matter , and not a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for integration .
it is therefore entirely legitimate to vote both for the Constitution and against it .
ratification is often por@@ tra@@ yed as an essential step which should not be open to too much discussion .
advo@@ ca@@ tes of the European Constitution sometimes even threa@@ ten that the Union will not allow itself to be held back by just a few countries not rati@@ fying the Constitution , and that these countries will be mar@@ g@@ in@@ alised and will have to content themselves with some less@@ er form of aff@@ iliation .
I consider this approach to be very un@@ fair .
I have already repe@@ a@@ tedly referred to the risk that democratic principles will be viol@@ ated ; I gre@@ w up in a political system where a che@@ er@@ ful and happy &apos; yes &quot; vote was the only possible choice at every election .
I should now like to issue a war@@ ning against the use of these same principles .
I am not trying to target the Constitutional Treaty directly .
I simply wish to emphasise the need for open and democratic discussion , and to stress that a failure to adopt the Constitution is not a disaster , nor does it mean an end to the process of integration in Europe .
on the contrary , it might lead to more prof@@ ound consideration as to where European integration is head@@ ing and where the vo@@ ters would really like to see it .
thank you for your attention .
Mr President , Madam V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my support , on my own behalf and on behalf of the Spanish Socialists , for the Cor@@ bet@@ t @-@ M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o report , which mar@@ ks the end of an historic process .
there have been two debates on the creation of constitu@@ tions in the European Union .
the first was the debate of the C@@ ong@@ ress of the European Mo@@ vement in 19@@ 48 , in which Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill , Re@@ y@@ na@@ ud , R@@ a@@ ma@@ di@@ er , van Z@@ e@@ el@@ and , Mad@@ ar@@ i@@ ag@@ a and A@@ den@@ au@@ er had the opportunity to begin deb@@ ating a Constitution for Europe .
Mr President , please allow me to refer to my country , which will be the first to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution , with a public and open debate which we believe is important for every@@ body .
it is true to say that the Z@@ a@@ pa@@ ter@@ o Government , after w@@ inning the elections of 14 March , un@@ b@@ loc@@ ked the process of ap@@ prov@@ ing the Constitution , but I would like to say - and I cannot see any Member of the Spanish Pe@@ op@@ les &quot; Party , and I would therefore ask the V@@ ice @-@ President of their Group , Mrs G@@ ros@@ s@@ et@@ ê@@ te , to commun@@ icate this on my behalf - that the Convention beg@@ an with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of Mr Az@@ na@@ r , and it was he who called for the referendum .
I therefore believe and hope that there will also be decisive support from the Spanish Pe@@ op@@ les &quot; Party - the support of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats appears to be guaranteed - for the whole of this process .
I believe that in that way we will be able to ensure that we have a referendum which genuinely s@@ ets a positive preced@@ ent for the referendu@@ ms in the other States which have decided to hold them and that there be a public and open debate .
I will end by saying that this conclu@@ des a process in which Europe has been construc@@ ted with pas@@ sion and with good sense , and this has led it to change history .
Mr President , any position on the European Constitution must be based on a balance between what this Constitution says and what it does not say - something that is not perhaps properly under@@ lined in the report we are voting on at this part @-@ session .
this lead@@ s me to say &apos; yes &apos; to this Constitution because of what it represents and because it means a new step forward on the way to a str@@ onger and more efficient , more transparent , more democratic Europe .
with this Constitution , Europe will have a str@@ onger voice in the world .
citizens will get better protection of their fundamental rights . their freedom and security will be better def@@ en@@ ded .
moreover , our values , including those which are behind our social and economic model , will be strongly proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed and protected to allow Europe &apos;s growth and , si@@ mul@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously , to protect Europe &apos;s social cohesion .
but that does not prevent me from acknowled@@ ging that the text reflec@@ ts the unfor@@ tun@@ ate bi@@ as of some political maj@@ orities that exis@@ ted in Europe at the time when it was draf@@ ted .
I particularly regret that it reflec@@ ts a vir@@ tual Europe , a Europe that is not the real Europe , a Europe that does not exist in political terms , where everything that lies between individual citizens and states is just ig@@ no@@ red .
peoples in Europe , regions , and their political role in the construction of a di@@ ver@@ se and plu@@ ral Europe have simply been ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted , have been passed over in sil@@ ence in this text .
but this is just not the reality of the Europe we are all building here together .
what is worse , some languages , such as my own - Ca@@ tal@@ an - which are str@@ onger than acknowled@@ ged offici@@ ally at European Union level , are b@@ lin@@ dly ig@@ no@@ red in this Constitution .
some of these problems can be sol@@ ved outside the Constitution , and some of us will keep fighting for that .
I will therefore join those who support this positive step forward in the building of Europe and I will strongly recommen@@ d a &apos; yes &apos; in the Spanish referendum , although I will fully comprehen@@ d and respect any other position taking a different view of this balance .
I will not take this text as something en@@ gra@@ ved in st@@ one , but as an improvement that allows us to keep working for a Europe where all citizens and peoples can feel com@@ for@@ table , and are acknowled@@ ged as they really are and want to be .
Mr President , we European Gre@@ ens are in favour of a &apos; yes &quot; vote in the coming referendum on the European Constitution in Spain .
we will have the great responsibility of holding the very first referendum on the continent , and a result expres@@ sing the Spanish citizens &quot; firm support for the Constitution will send a clear and strong message to the other European countries and will provide the im@@ pe@@ tus to carry on building the Europe we want to see after ratification .
our &apos; yes &quot; is a deman@@ ding &apos; yes . &quot;
on the other hand , we are concerned and conf@@ used by the position of the Spanish Pe@@ op@@ les &quot; Party .
I would ask the question : what has happened to those people who said they wanted to di@@ e for Nice , such as Mr Az@@ na@@ r ?
I see that they are still ali@@ ve and k@@ ic@@ king and that they are currently creating con@@ fu@@ sion , double language and al@@ arm in relation to the coming referendum in Spain , putting n@@ ar@@ row @-@ min@@ ded party @-@ political interests above European integration .
this double language , together with an attitude of saying or doing little in relation to the Constitution , and conf@@ using the people with other issues which have little to do with the Constitution , does very little to promote European integration .
some people are calling for a &apos; yes &quot; without any real con@@ vic@@ tion and sen@@ ding conf@@ used and contradic@@ tory messa@@ ges to their own vo@@ ters , seeking only to ero@@ de the current government of Spain .
the deman@@ ding &apos; yes &quot; that we Gre@@ ens advoc@@ ate means cho@@ os@@ ing to take advantage of the new European political area construc@@ tively in favour of the social and ec@@ ological Europe we want .
the Constitution is not the end of the road , it is not the final des@@ tin@@ ation , and is not even an in@@ n .
we believe , like An@@ ton@@ io Mac@@ ha@@ do , that the path is made by w@@ al@@ king ; we believe that this Constitution is a step forward and we will continue along this road in the future .
Mr President , I must again point out the wis@@ dom contained in the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an M@@ oun@@ ta@@ ine@@ ers &quot; H@@ and@@ bo@@ o@@ k . in the event of a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy between the ma@@ p and the ter@@ ra@@ in , follow the ter@@ ra@@ in .
otherwise , we end up in trag@@ edy or f@@ ar@@ ce , something we are well on the way towards .
this is due to the fact that , in crucial areas , the Constitution goes against the democratic inten@@ tions that are invo@@ ked and cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly de@@ pri@@ ves genuine democracy of vital sus@@ ten@@ ance .
the Constitution involves a huge concentra@@ tion and cen@@ tr@@ alisation of the EU el@@ ite@@ s &quot; political power , especially over the judic@@ i@@ ary and police .
the EU Constitution constitu@@ tes a genuine abol@@ ition of living democracy in civil society , especially since the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the EU &apos;s power makes real democratic control impossible .
the only hope in this process lies in the forthcoming referendu@@ ms .
the EU el@@ ite@@ s are trying to abol@@ ish this ultima@@ te democratic element too .
democracy is now so deep@@ ly compromis@@ ed that it is open@@ ly prac@@ tis@@ ed as the power of the el@@ ite to go@@ ver@@ n the people .
the fight against the EU Constitution is a fight for democracy , and one that we intend to w@@ in outside this House .
Mr President , it is pre@@ tty clear that what we are involved in here is a one @-@ si@@ ded exercise in sell@@ ing this Constitution to the peoples of Europe .
lis@@ tening to some of the talk , you would think the Sec@@ ond Com@@ ing of the L@@ or@@ d was being deb@@ ated .
starting this week , you will be spending large amounts of tax@@ pay@@ ers &apos; money tell@@ ing people what they should think and how they should vote .
I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order .
some weeks ago I re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed to this Parliament Commissioner Bar@@ ro@@ t &apos;s past and the aff@@ air was wh@@ ite@@ w@@ as@@ hed .
now it has emer@@ ged that during his hear@@ ing , S@@ i@@ i@@ m Kal@@ la@@ s , who is in charge of the anti @-@ fraud dri@@ ve , gave deliber@@ ately mis@@ leading information and in@@ acc@@ ura@@ te da@@ tes , and used a mis@@ interpre@@ tation as a means of s@@ hy@@ ing away from a vital question .
yesterday afternoon , President B@@ or@@ re@@ l@@ l den@@ ied me the chance to make a one @-@ minu@@ te speech to mention this to Parliament .
you will not w@@ in your constitutional b@@ attle by bur@@ ying the truth and by fail@@ ing to have a proper debate .
the whole process will fall yet further into dis@@ re@@ pu@@ te , although , given the fact that I , along with many colleagues here , will be campa@@ ig@@ ning for a &apos; no &apos; vote , perhaps I should be grateful for the manner in which you conduct y@@ ourselves .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there have been times in the course of this debate when one might have been for@@ given for thinking that no criticism of the Constitution had ever been vo@@ ic@@ ed .
I believe that this will change when the Members of this House return to their countries and en@@ counter di@@ ver@@ se and var@@ ied criticism of the Constitution from a number of very different quar@@ ters .
the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , in common with many of the other political groups in this House , is divid@@ ed on the issue of the Constitution .
the members of La@@ w and Justice who constitute the Pol@@ ish element in this group are opposed to it , not because it would be a bad thing for Pol@@ and , but because it would be a bad thing for Europe .
to begin with , the Treaty al@@ ters the system according to which votes are coun@@ ted , to the dis@@ advantage of countries with a particular interest in policies relating to E@@ as@@ tern Europe , cohesion and agriculture .
this applies to Pol@@ and in all three ins@@ tan@@ ces , of course , yet it is not the implications for Pol@@ and that are the most significant problem , but the wea@@ ken@@ ing of whole sectors of European policy .
the Treaty strength@@ ens the EU &apos;s powers over economic , employment and social policy within the Union .
it does not yet go so far as to grant exclu@@ sive competences , of course , and no decisive step has yet been taken .
nevertheless , it substan@@ ti@@ ally strength@@ ens the EU &apos;s powers .
yet it is not harmonisation of economic policy that Europe needs , but systems competition in this field .
harmonisation will consi@@ g@@ n Europe to the mar@@ g@@ ins of global competition .
the Treaty is a significant step towards use of the Community method in the field of foreign policy .
again , no final decisions have yet been made , but a step has been taken in that direction .
it is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Community method and the in@@ ter @-@ state method in foreign policy , and Mr R@@ eh@@ n , the new Commissioner , ad@@ mitted as much during his hear@@ ing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
finally , the Treaty is based on fal@@ se pre@@ mis@@ es from its very first lines .
an example of such fal@@ se@@ ho@@ od and extre@@ me pre@@ jud@@ ice is the remo@@ val from the pre@@ am@@ ble of refer@@ ences to Christi@@ an@@ ity and G@@ od , whose presence is still felt in the majority of the European Union &apos;s Member States .
these are all reasons why today we must say &apos; no &quot; to the Treaty and &apos; no &quot; to this motion for a resolution in order to say &apos; yes &quot; to Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , not only is the draft Constitution far from being ide@@ al , it is also far from being the compromise it could have been .
those in favour of a Constitution and a better European Constitution would do best to reject this draft , as I am in no doubt that a subsequ@@ ent one would be an improvement .
the members of S@@ elf @-@ Def@@ ence will vote in favour of Amendment No 10@@ 2 , an extremely important amendment by Mr B@@ on@@ de to which I have put my own name .
the democratic defic@@ it would be increased if national parliamentary competences were to be han@@ ded over not to the democra@@ tically elected European Parliament , but to the un@@ elected European Commission , and this would be most un@@ des@@ ira@@ ble .
it would also be un@@ des@@ ira@@ ble to ab@@ and@@ on the principle of &apos; one country , one Commissioner . &quot;
yet it would be a good idea to hand back to the nation states all matters which are not in actual fact of sup@@ r@@ a @-@ national importance , and more freedom and less cen@@ tr@@ alism is a good principle to follow .
in conclusion , I should like to say that the members of S@@ elf @-@ Def@@ ence are open to the idea of an EU Constitution .
we do not reject it as such , but we cannot vote in favour of the motion for a resolution as it stands .
we have doub@@ ts , and these doub@@ ts are shared by millions of in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants of the EU &apos;s Member States .
yet we are open to dialogue , as this is what the millions of in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants of our countries want .
we will therefore ab@@ sta@@ in from voting in the final vote .
- Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate the two rapporteurs , Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , on their remar@@ ka@@ ble report .
I should also , however , like to thank Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing , without whom , I am sure , we would not be here today deb@@ ating this historic stage in Europe &apos;s development .
we are in a position to g@@ au@@ ge how far we have come .
the greatest danger for Europe would be to fall back into inter@@ governmental methods .
indeed , we must de@@ pl@@ or@@ e the fact that European governments have not followed all the proposals made by the Convention , the consequ@@ ence of which is that we shall gradu@@ ally have to adap@@ t the Constitution as we go along .
in fact , what we need is more Europe in a glob@@ alised world conf@@ ron@@ ted with terrorism , mi@@ gra@@ tory flo@@ ws , climate change and major economic dis@@ ruption .
we need more Europe , more Union - a Union based on our univers@@ al values - and more democracy .
the Constitution will bring all of this , strengthening Parliament &apos;s role and involving national parliaments at the same time .
those rejec@@ ting this Constitution speak of Brussels bureauc@@ racy , of a los@@ s of national soverei@@ gn@@ ty and of a European super@@ state .
for want of arguments , they tro@@ t out the same back@@ ward @-@ looking s@@ log@@ ans , which are today de@@ vo@@ id of mean@@ ing because they bear no relation to reality .
this is typ@@ ical of their in@@ ability to look to the future .
how else can we explain that all 25 of our governments agreed to adopt the Constitution ?
they certainly did not intend to com@@ mit .
because we must work collec@@ tively together in the service of the European citizen and for future gener@@ ations , we say &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution for Europe .
Europeans must choose between in@@ su@@ lar@@ ity and par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , on the one hand , and op@@ enn@@ ess and modern@@ ity , on the other .
the choice is simple - if we want a free and responsible Europe , we must rati@@ fy the Constitution for Europe .
- Mr President , as a French soci@@ alist and as a European soci@@ alist , I shall be voting tomorrow , with em@@ o@@ tion and pr@@ ide , in favour of the report by the two Members of this House .
I shall therefore turn my speech into a tribu@@ te - a tribu@@ te to Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i , who dre@@ w up the first European Constitution in this democra@@ tically @-@ elected House .
I never forget that he was a ve@@ ter@@ an of the young commun@@ ists and I turn to my fellow soci@@ alists and say to them &apos; never forget where you have come from . &quot;
he was an old anti @-@ fas@@ c@@ ist mili@@ tant , an old feder@@ alist , and I pay tribu@@ te to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14 February 198@@ 4 .
Mr Poettering voted in favour , Mr H@@ än@@ s@@ ch voted in favour , Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z voted against and Mr Ver@@ g@@ è@@ s voted against .
they will do so again , lo@@ y@@ al as they are .
if you re @-@ read the text on which we shall vote tomorrow , you will no@@ tice that it takes up a number of elements of that old text .
let me give you some examples .
Article 3 of the S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i report en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es the principle of European citiz@@ en@@ ship ; Article 4 , respect for fundamental rights ; Article 6 , legal person@@ ality ; Article 9 , the Union &apos;s objective of full employment ; Article 34 spea@@ ks of European laws ; Article 44 men@@ tions sanctions ; Article 8@@ 2 of Par@@ t 4 , which is Par@@ t 3 today , spea@@ ks of ratification , and I could go on .
what I am trying to say is that tomorrow &apos;s vote forms part of the context of this long history , and that this Constitution has not simply fall@@ en out of the s@@ ky ; it is part of a major histor@@ ical movement .
the se@@ am was first min@@ ed over 50 years ago and y@@ iel@@ ded the ra@@ w material of re@@ conciliation .
the single currency , the euro , which is more than ten years old , was Germany &apos;s currency of re@@ conciliation .
let us therefore view this Constitution as a hand pro@@ ff@@ er@@ ed to the peoples who have join@@ ed us again , now that the d@@ ar@@ k night of tota@@ li@@ tari@@ an@@ ism is over .
- Mr President , current events demonstrate that we need Europe now more than ever .
we need Europe to protect us , and to initi@@ ate and dri@@ ve forward an original social model .
we need Europe to gener@@ ate growth , to coordin@@ ate our economic policies and to combat unemployment .
we need Europe to implement a genuine research and development policy , like the one pursu@@ ed by the United States .
we need Europe to protect and preser@@ ve our environment and , finally , we need a Europe that car@@ ries w@@ eight in the world , with military and civil European defence , and a genuine foreign policy .
the world &apos;s balance depen@@ ds on Europe &apos;s continued existence .
in order to address this enormous expec@@ tation we need more effective , more transparent and more democratic institutions .
we need institutions that move away from a way of working that is all too often inter@@ governmental , where@@ by decisions are always taken without the citizens ever being involved .
we need institutions that favour Community decision @-@ making , because this is the only truly democratic method of decision @-@ making .
we also need strong institutions , enab@@ ling us to move towards a more integrated Europe , despite the ti@@ mid@@ ity of the Heads of State or Government .
this is why we support both this excellent and well @-@ written report and the draft Constitution .
even if it does not go as far as we would like , this Constitution is a symb@@ ol@@ ic and significant step towards a more uni@@ fied , str@@ onger and more democratic Europe .
we o@@ we that to our citizens .
Mr President , for the Ca@@ tal@@ an Re@@ pub@@ lic@@ an L@@ ef@@ t - the - and for the other parties in our European co@@ al@@ ition - for example from the Bas@@ que country , Ara@@ g@@ on and An@@ d@@ alu@@ sia - this is not a good Constitutional Treaty .
it does not recognise our wish for internal enlargement .
sta@@ tel@@ ess nations will not have any recognition in this Treaty .
we would have accepted the Treaty if only it had included a small step forward - official @-@ language status for the Ca@@ tal@@ an language .
today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Members may not speak their mo@@ ther ton@@ gue .
of this 2 % , the vas@@ t majority of us are Ca@@ tal@@ an speakers .
I am the four@@ th Ca@@ tal@@ an @-@ speaking Member - after President B@@ or@@ re@@ l@@ l , Mr Gu@@ ar@@ d@@ ans C@@ amb@@ ó and Mr H@@ am@@ mer@@ ste@@ in M@@ in@@ t@@ z - to speak here this morning in a language other than our own -
we reject this constitutional Treaty because we want to be directly involved in Europe and want a str@@ onger , more united and cohes@@ i@@ ve Europe , buil@@ t on its own diversity ; just the opposite of a nation @-@ state buil@@ t on the basis of the French model and against pl@@ ur@@ il@@ ing@@ u@@ alism , diversity and pl@@ ur@@ ina@@ tion@@ ality .
working nation @-@ states do not make a good basis for the construction of Europe .
Europe should be buil@@ t on the basis of national diversity comp@@ ris@@ ing sta@@ tel@@ ess nations , nation @-@ states and constitutional regions , for the purpose of establishing a new European citiz@@ en@@ ship .
- Mr President , the primary duty of a parliament is to represent the people .
our duty in relation to the Constitutional Treaty should be , first of all , to measure the ga@@ p between the peoples of Europe and this Treaty : without the people there can be no Constitution .
to the democratic defic@@ it in the draf@@ ting of the Treaty we can now add the lack of democracy in its adoption : if we cannot have a single referendum for all of Europe &apos;s citizens , we could at least have held a referendum on the same day in all the countries of the Union .
instead , however , everything is done hap@@ ha@@ z@@ ar@@ dly and people are just as div@@ or@@ ced from the Treaty today as they were yesterday .
Europe is in danger of going the way of the t@@ it@@ les of a fam@@ ous tr@@ il@@ og@@ y by the great European intell@@ ec@@ tual I@@ tal@@ o C@@ al@@ v@@ ino : from to to .
there are no people and there is no constitutional spirit in the Treaty ; it la@@ cks any idea of its place in the world and in time .
that is all very serious , at a wor@@ rying time when war and terrorism have come to pre@@ domin@@ ate in politics , when natural disas@@ ters like the one in South @-@ East Asia speak of the social in@@ justice and the in@@ toler@@ able poverty of this world .
in a glob@@ alised world , Europe is in danger of dec@@ lin@@ ing : there is a feel@@ ing of m@@ al@@ ais@@ e in Europe linked to its internal crisis of social cohesion , while ins@@ tability has become the key social factor of our times .
this Treaty represents the ab@@ d@@ ication of politics in the face of all that : a sil@@ ent Constitution .
in it , peace is a va@@ gue as@@ pi@@ ration , not a re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation of war .
in it , the rights of people , women and men , workers and mi@@ grants , are a vari@@ able dependent on a balanced budget and monetary stability .
democracy is an op@@ tional ex@@ tra .
the Constitutional Treaty does not provide for rights , apart from those of the market ; it does not propose reforms ; it has no future ; but instead it ke@@ ep@@ s Europe stu@@ ck in its present crisis .
it is not just ina@@ dequate : it is the wrong direction al@@ together .
that is why the Con@@ feder@@ al Group of the European United L@@ ef@@ t / Nor@@ di@@ c Green L@@ ef@@ t is declar@@ ing itself against this Treaty and will be campa@@ ig@@ ning against it in every country .
we need to free ourselves of this enc@@ u@@ mb@@ ran@@ ce in order to build the Europe of the future .
Mr President , today , the European Parliament is deb@@ ating a treaty that is , as regards its nature and content , a constitution , or at least that is what the rapporteurs tell us we are doing .
in the report , they take as their starting point the appar@@ ent opposition between the Council and Member States on the one hand and Parliament and the citizens on the other .
in doing so , they over@@ look the fact that the European institutions o@@ we their existence to the voluntary transfer of powers by the Member States .
moreover , citizens continue to identi@@ fy primarily with their own state .
a European id@@ entity that has been imposed from above , with its own symb@@ ol@@ ism , will not change this in any way .
the treaty en@@ do@@ ws the European Union with the character@@ is@@ tics of a state .
one unfor@@ tun@@ ate ill@@ ustra@@ tion of this is the Foreign Affairs Minister , a joint figu@@ re@@ head who has to cover up the lack of joint policy , and it is equally unfor@@ tun@@ ate that this person himself becomes an institution .
the rapporteurs have to recognise that the du@@ al responsibility on the part of the Council and Commission cre@@ ates con@@ fu@@ sion and so@@ ws the se@@ ed@@ s of potential conflicts of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
I cannot descri@@ be this treaty as anything other than an im@@ pe@@ tu@@ ous lea@@ p in the d@@ ar@@ k .
- Mr President , as a Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian I ought to be pro@@ ud that my country &apos;s parliament was the first to rati@@ fy the European Constitution .
however , the majority of Li@@ thu@@ ania &apos;s citizens have not seen , read or discussed it .
it was not even deb@@ ated by Li@@ thu@@ ania &apos;s Parliament .
on the other hand I am sure that for the most part this Constitution is in keeping with the interests of my nation and state .
however , I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to Par@@ t 1 Article 8 of the Constitution , which la@@ ys down that the word euro - the name of the common currency of the European Union - must be used in the same way in all European Union languages .
it goes against the fundamental principle of the Constitution and that of the creation of the European Union itself , that is , respect for national languages and cul@@ tures .
according to this ar@@ ticle , which is based on Council Regulation No 9@@ 7@@ 4 / 9@@ 8 of 1998 , there would be an un@@ preced@@ ented intervention in the gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical systems s@@ hap@@ ed over thousands of years and in sem@@ an@@ tic relations expressed not in word order , not in words with one form , but in the dec@@ len@@ sion of words , of the languages of the se@@ ven new countries of the European Union , among them the Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian language .
the Regulation mentioned , announced six years ago , before the new countries were ad@@ mitted to the European Union , does not allow the word euro to be dec@@ lined .
such a ban contradic@@ ts Article 3@@ 14 of the European Community Treaty and Article 5@@ 3 of the Treaty on European Union on the true equality of the European Union &apos;s official languages , as well as European Community Treaty Article 5 on subsi@@ dis@@ ation and Article 15@@ 1 on the limits of cultural policies .
I asked the Commission and the Council why these circumstances have not been taken into consideration and four months later Mr Al@@ mu@@ nia , the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs , re@@ pli@@ ed that the non @-@ dec@@ lin@@ able word euro is used in the Constitution because this was laid down in the Council Regulation .
back to s@@ qu@@ are one , and dis@@ respect for national languages remain@@ ed .
if such a ban remains in the Constitution , then in the Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ian ver@@ sion and all legislation we will have an ab@@ und@@ ance of not only un@@ gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical but ab@@ sur@@ d statements .
I hope that Parliament will take these arguments into account .
thank you for your attention .
- Mr President , a Constitution is the foun@@ ding act of a State , and it was an entirely con@@ sci@@ ous decision to choose that term , just as it was to give the EU a fla@@ g , an an@@ them , a mo@@ t@@ to and even a national cel@@ e@@ bra@@ tion .
despite your pa@@ the@@ tic den@@ i@@ als , the European Constitution is , therefore , without doubt , the foun@@ ding act of a European super@@ state .
it represents the death of our often an@@ ci@@ ent nations and their trans@@ for@@ mation into a number of power@@ less prov@@ inc@@ es within this bureauc@@ ratic , om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent and cen@@ tr@@ alised State .
I know that you b@@ li@@ th@@ ely acc@@ use those who do not share your b@@ lin@@ d beli@@ ef in the benefits of the Europe of Brussels of lies , of medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity and even of stu@@ pid@@ ity .
this is a han@@ dy tac@@ tic and enta@@ ils never having to explain .
it also makes it possible to follow the per@@ emp@@ tory statements of the happy few , who know - or think they know - what is good for the , in their view , un@@ cul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted , m@@ ass@@ es .
the fear ins@@ ti@@ lled in you by the fact that referendu@@ ms are to be held on the Constitution is an ill@@ ustra@@ tion of the con@@ te@@ mp@@ t in which you hold the citizens .
what , for that matter , are the benefits of which people speak ?
I have seen with my own e@@ yes , as a direct consequ@@ ence of European policies , the destruction of our farming and of our econom@@ ies , company re@@ loc@@ ations and de@@ indus@@ tri@@ alisation , en@@ dem@@ ic unemployment and poverty , the dis@@ integration of our social protection systems , the opening of our borders to immigration on a mas@@ sive scale , to terrorism and to international crime .
the Europe of Brussels is not , of course , sol@@ ely responsible - it could not have created or exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated these problems without the coll@@ u@@ sion of governments , of all political hu@@ es , which have decided to sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ e their countries &quot; independence and their in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants &quot; freedom to the Brussels Le@@ vi@@ a@@ than .
the European Constitution will put the fin@@ is@@ hing tou@@ ches to this mon@@ stro@@ us e@@ di@@ fic@@ e , which was be@@ gu@@ n over 40 years ago .
that might be what you want , but we are rejec@@ ting it because Europe and the Europeans deser@@ ve better than this sou@@ ll@@ ess super@@ state .
we are rejec@@ ting it in the name of freedom , in the name of independence , in the name of the soverei@@ gn@@ ty which bel@@ ong@@ s sol@@ ely to the people and which is in@@ ali@@ enable , and in the name of those people &apos;s right to self @-@ determination .
the Members of this House have bet@@ ra@@ yed their hom@@ el@@ an@@ ds .
their gu@@ il@@ t is there for all to see .
they will be cur@@ sed by history and by future gener@@ ations .
- Mr President , we would be making a serious mis@@ take if we considered the Union to be merely an economic entity or a vas@@ t free @-@ trade area , or even a kind of super@@ state re@@ pla@@ cing the national states .
Europe is primarily a great ide@@ al , and it was an ide@@ al for the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers Al@@ c@@ ide De G@@ as@@ per@@ i and K@@ on@@ ra@@ d A@@ den@@ au@@ er , from R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ c@@ human to Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i , from G@@ a@@ e@@ tan@@ o Mar@@ tin@@ o to Hel@@ mu@@ t K@@ oh@@ l .
Europe is our history : it is the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of our cul@@ tures and our languages , our id@@ entity and our future .
it is the Europe of values , of the central importance of the individual , of freedom , solidarity and subsidiarity .
we cannot think of a Union sh@@ ut in ti@@ ghtly within its borders ; we cannot think of Europe as a ma@@ ch@@ ine - al@@ be@@ it an efficient one - run by a bureauc@@ racy that ke@@ ep@@ s changing the rules .
on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity itself , Europe must instead solve the major problems of its citizens which other institutions are unable to address .
does the Constitution interpre@@ t these values ?
the answer is substan@@ ti@@ ally &apos; yes , &quot; even though we cannot h@@ ide our prof@@ ound regret that there is no reference to the Union &apos;s Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o @-@ Christian ro@@ ots .
such a reference would have represented not a religious choice , but the identi@@ fication of our un@@ den@@ i@@ able histor@@ ical ro@@ ots .
the decision to sign the Constitution in R@@ ome was , for our country , an important acknowled@@ g@@ ement of the work carried out during the six months of Italy &apos;s Presidency .
to be effective , a fundamental law needs to have life brea@@ th@@ ed into it ; in other words , it has to be put into practice and inves@@ ted with political power .
that is why Europe , through the Constitution , really must speak with a single voice in foreign policy .
it must w@@ in a se@@ at on the new UN Security Council and it must be an ex@@ por@@ ter of peace and not just of special interests in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East .
the world of globalisation needs this Europe , the Europe of solidarity , subsidiarity and human rights - the political Europe of the people whom this Parliament truly represents .
thank you , Mr President .
there can be no doubt that Europe , the Member States , and , above all , Europe &apos;s citizens need a European Constitution .
the present framework of the Treaties is too n@@ ar@@ row for an enlarg@@ ing Europe .
what was adequate for 15 Member States is no longer adequate for 25 Member States .
after all , one would not try to d@@ ress a fully @-@ gro@@ wn 25 @-@ year @-@ old in the same su@@ it he wor@@ e when he was 15 years old .
he would need to be b@@ ought a new one .
the same is true for Europe , and the enlarged European Union must therefore have a legal and organis@@ ational framework that cor@@ respon@@ ds to its siz@@ e , inten@@ tions and amb@@ itions .
the European Constitution cre@@ ates such a framework .
the Constitution is a good document as it represents a compromise .
it makes the EU more citizen @-@ fri@@ en@@ dly , more efficient and better .
it also makes the Union a place where human beings are valu@@ ed and where democracy and security are safe@@ guar@@ ded .
moreover , it provides for a high level of protection of citizens &quot; personal rights , and grants them better access to the affairs of the entire EU and influence on the European Union &apos;s legislative capac@@ ities .
the EU &apos;s citizens are well aware of this , and this is why they support the European Constitution in such large nu@@ mb@@ ers , even if they are not entirely fam@@ ili@@ ar with the details of its con@@ ten@@ ts .
this is the case in my country , Pol@@ and .
I am pro@@ ud to be able to tell you that 7@@ 3 % of Pol@@ es are in favour of the European Constitution , despite the reser@@ vations pre@@ viously expressed by my government with regard to the draft Treaty , and despite the campaign that has been conduc@@ ted against the Constitution within the country .
it has become appar@@ ent that it is a mis@@ take to explo@@ it the Constitution in domestic political dispu@@ tes .
no political party has the right to call for the Constitution to be rejected , even if it is in opposition .
referendu@@ ms on the Constitution should rela@@ te to its con@@ ten@@ ts , and not turn into anti @-@ governmental ple@@ b@@ is@@ ci@@ tes .
the citizens of the European Union are aware of this , and this is why they know better than politicians what is good for them .
they sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to the view that wh@@ o@@ ever is in favour of Europe is in favour of the European Constitution .
we should lis@@ ten to them .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Constitution , or Constitutional Treaty , is a better legal basis than any we in the European Union have pre@@ viously had , and , as it is a good and acceptable compromise , our group really can vote to endorse it .
we should regard the European Constitutional Treaty as being , above all , a great chance to construc@@ t a shared European id@@ entity .
that is what we in Europe need : a sense of being &apos; us , &quot; a feel@@ ing of bel@@ ong@@ ing together , with us all seeing ourselves as Europeans and also Ger@@ man@@ s , W@@ es@@ t@@ p@@ hal@@ ians from the nor@@ th of the R@@ h@@ ine , and , in my case , citizens of C@@ olog@@ ne - all this made possible by this European Constitutional Treaty .
we have written our shared values into this Constitutional Treaty , thereby making this old continent into something of a new world , for the won@@ der@@ ful thing about this Constitutional Treaty is that we are defin@@ ing in precise terms what hol@@ ds us together .
if this feel@@ ing of being &apos; us , &quot; this id@@ entity , is to come into being , it is quite vital that all Europeans should be able to decide for themselves whether they want this Constitution .
that is why we are campa@@ ig@@ ning for referendu@@ ms on it in every European country , for although most of the people can now vote on the Constitutional Treaty , not all Europeans can .
if the people of Europe are to know , firstly , that this Constitution exists , and secondly , having given it some thought , that they want it , it is vital that they themselves should be asked .
we should therefore let people themselves vote and make an effort to ensure that referendu@@ ms are held in every country .
it will not , unfortunately , be possible to organ@@ ise it so that they are held all on the same day , but , if people themselves are asked , it will in any case enhan@@ ce their sense of id@@ entity , their awareness of being &apos; us . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , I would inv@@ ite you to see this Constitutional Treaty in perspective and not as the fin@@ ished ar@@ ticle .
the European idea has never been fi@@ xed , and it will not now be fi@@ xed in the wor@@ ding of this new Treaty .
this Constitution is an important , essential and in@@ dis@@ pensa@@ ble sta@@ ging post , but it is still only a sta@@ ging post .
Mr G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing said of this document that it was un@@ hop@@ ed @-@ for .
I pre@@ fer to say of it that , broad@@ ly speaking , it can still be improved , given the extent to which , and despite the un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able advan@@ ces it enta@@ ils , the d@@ ross from the previous documents still cl@@ ings to it .
our fellow citizens are prepared to live with this document as an inte@@ ri@@ m report on their common history but have no desire to be taken h@@ osta@@ ge by it for dec@@ ad@@ es , with all movement on what was the European compromise at the beginning of the twenty @-@ first century inde@@ fin@@ i@@ tely post@@ pon@@ ed .
that is the whole point of Amendment No 17 , which I have tabled on behalf of my group and which a great many of my fellow MEPs have co @-@ signed .
through this very clear and very brief amendment , our Parliament , and I quo@@ te , &apos; &#91; a &#93; n@@ n@@ oun@@ ces its intention of using the new right of initiative con@@ fer@@ red upon it by the Constitution to propose amendments to the latter . &quot;
I would thank our two co @-@ rapporteurs , Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , for having supported this amendment , as it is the medium through which our House indic@@ ates that , while remain@@ ing fore@@ ver the dri@@ ving force of European development , it is atten@@ tive to the social and democratic advan@@ ces a@@ wa@@ ited by our fellow citizens .
if the document were to be set in st@@ one , there would be a danger of the same thing happening to the Constitution too .
moreover , any st@@ one out of which the Constitutional Treaty were to be car@@ ved would not , whatever Mr G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing may think , be that out of which the e@@ ques@@ tri@@ an sta@@ tu@@ e comm@@ em@@ or@@ ating the President of the Convention would also be car@@ ved . it might , rather , be that mar@@ king the gra@@ ve of the European project .
the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance would therefore again inv@@ ite you to emb@@ ra@@ ce a prog@@ res@@ sive Europe , as the constitutional process is still in its early days , and its streng@@ th and interest li@@ e specifically in its new@@ ness .
I once w@@ ro@@ te a bo@@ o@@ k on the emerg@@ ence of human rights the@@ ory and on the American Constitution , so I have some understanding of the positive aspects of this document .
what I do not understand , however , is why the European Parliament wishes fre@@ ely to condemn itself to a second @-@ clas@@ s position by supporting this document .
Article I@@ II @-@ 3@@ 30 ( 2 ) read@@ s as follows : &apos; a European law of the European Parliament shall la@@ y down the regulations and general conditions govern@@ ing the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of the du@@ ties of its Members .
the European Parliament shall act on its own initiative after seeking an opinion from the Commission and after ob@@ tain@@ ing the con@@ sent of the Council .
the Council shall act unanim@@ ously on all rules or conditions relating to the taxation of Members or former Members . &quot;
this preser@@ ves the su@@ pre@@ ma@@ cy of the Commission , the execu@@ tive , which has more rights than we do , and it also preser@@ ves the un@@ just dis@@ par@@ ities between us as legitimate representatives of the European people .
only we are truly legitimate , with all the other European bodies being der@@ iva@@ tive , and so I believe that this provision must be om@@ it@@ ted .
although Mrs Wall@@ strö@@ m has just said that we would have more democracy , I do not think that it is more democracy we want , but merely democracy , pur@@ e and simple .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if you gave the Constitution , or whatever you ultimately call it , to a car@@ to@@ on@@ ist in any country of Europe who res@@ pects the principles of democracy , of national soverei@@ gn@@ ty , of the values of the historic and cultural her@@ ita@@ ge , he would draw it like a min@@ c@@ er from which various parts of various animals , from s@@ he@@ ep to co@@ ws , come out in the form of min@@ ced meat .
but people are not animals and it is a crime to tre@@ at them like min@@ ced meat .
fas@@ c@@ ism did it with weapons and some people appear to en@@ v@@ y its inten@@ tions , and 6@@ 5 years later certain other weapons such as money and pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da are being used for the same reason .
we therefore say no to the c@@ ann@@ ing of the peoples of Europe , no to the law of the jun@@ g@@ le which th@@ ro@@ t@@ t@@ les the wea@@ k , no to the im@@ position of under@@ hand appro@@ ac@@ hes and people and no to efforts to turn citizens into do@@ c@@ ile ro@@ bo@@ ts in the hands of mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tion@@ als and ban@@ ks .
we say yes to the right of opinion and rejec@@ tion , yes to the Europe of soverei@@ g@@ n nations , yes to Christi@@ an@@ ity and human rights , yes to the pr@@ ide and dignity of the peoples .
&apos;@@ i recognise you by the fi@@ er@@ ce ed@@ ge of your s@@ word .
I recognise you by the look which measures the ear@@ th with force . &quot;
and force used on the spirit is worse than force against the body .
there is still time for res@@ is@@ tance .
we have time to re@@ ver@@ se globalisation and the new order of things . &apos; .
Mr President , since the first six countries join@@ ed forces , the European Commun@@ ities have developed a form of cooperation that is not perfec@@ t but that is nonetheless a form of cooperation between states of equal value whose governments have the last word concerning the states &quot; co@@ oper@@ ative participation .
what is more , the ad@@ her@@ ents of this Constitution have not today conc@@ e@@ al@@ ed the fact that Europe is to be govern@@ ed not by the countries &quot; governments but by a strong Commission whose parliamentary leg@@ ality lies in the directly elected European Parliament .
my party and I dispu@@ te the sense and val@@ id@@ ity of this construction .
this Constitution remo@@ ves countries &quot; independence in favour of a non @-@ transparent regime pursu@@ ing objectives that , in all too many cases , do not have g@@ ras@@ s @-@ ro@@ ots support .
my country &apos;s ol@@ des@@ t constitutional document , the J@@ ut@@ ish La@@ w of 12@@ 41 , states , for example , and I quo@@ te : &apos; the law shall be hon@@ est and just , toler@@ able in terms of the country &apos;s custom@@ s , appropriate , useful and clear , so that everyone might know and understand what the law says . &quot;
it may be said of the Constitution that we are deb@@ ating in this House today that it is not hon@@ est about the inten@@ tions behind it .
if it is just , it is only so in the e@@ yes of those who wish to am@@ as@@ s power throughout the whole of Europe .
it is not toler@@ able for the majority of Europeans , for it only cor@@ respon@@ ds to the custom@@ s of a few countries .
it is of no use in terms of free cooperation , and it is not clear , for no one can know and understand what the Constitution says .
this draft Constitution must be rejected .
otherwise , the EU will end up as a regime of the big powers , which will damage the EU as a whole .
I recommen@@ d the minority &apos;s amendment .
Europe deser@@ ves better .
please allow me , ladies and gentlemen , to use my time to explain the actual suppl@@ ementary proposal , to dig@@ ress a little from the spirit of the previous discussion .
the proposal I refer to , Pro@@ pos@@ al No 10 , correc@@ ts one of the dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies introduced by the Constitution , those dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies about which so much has been said today .
in fact , the text of the agricultural policy is out of date in the Constitution , fif@@ ty years out of date .
the legitimate aim of agricultural policy half a century ago was to produce sufficient food .
today the situation is re@@ ver@@ sed , Europe has the problem of dispos@@ ing of its sur@@ pl@@ uses .
the European Parliament &apos;s A@@ G@@ R@@ I committee has even pointed , in its views on the Constitution , to the direct conflict between the original aims of the common agricultural policy and the Constitution .
on the other hand , increased competitiveness is a priority aim of all the reforms which have been and are being made in the common agricultural policy - but this is not included in the Constitution .
the draft amendment rights this wrong .
it would also be des@@ ira@@ ble for the European Parliament to adopt this draft amendment because , in the entire resolution of the European Parliament , this is actually the only reference to the most important common policy - the agricultural policy .
the subject of our debate , the Constitution , may be the first joint creation of the re@@ united Europe .
the Member States may also regard it as their own , as we , including myself , partici@@ pa@@ ted in the work of the Convention draf@@ ting the Constitution for a year and a half .
it is , perhaps , not by accident that two new Member States , Li@@ thu@@ ania and H@@ un@@ g@@ ary were the first to rati@@ fy the Constitution .
the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian parliament even proposed an amendment including minority rights among the fundamental principles of the Constitution .
it is an important basic principle , since Europe is also the Europe of minorities , and everyone is a minority in Europe .
at the same time , it is important that minority rights are exerc@@ ised collec@@ tively and mu@@ tually and that the Constitution allows for this as well .
this is , therefore , very ple@@ as@@ ing to us .
however , I find it a little un@@ sett@@ ling that there are many people here in the European Parliament and also among the European public who were off@@ en@@ ded by the acknowled@@ g@@ ement of the histor@@ ical fact that Christi@@ an@@ ity contribu@@ ted to building a joint Europe , to the creation of today &apos;s Europe .
it was by no means an attempt to get rid of a sec@@ ular Europe , but we found it necessary that in addition to men@@ tioning the in@@ her@@ i@@ tance of human@@ ism , en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment and other common European values , the pre@@ am@@ ble acknowled@@ ged the contribution of Christi@@ an@@ ity to this joint Europe and its role in making it possible for us to be here today .
I am , however , pleased that the Constitution allows for an institutional dialogue between ch@@ ur@@ ches and the European Union , which is a very important aspect for ch@@ ur@@ ches .
this hol@@ ds true , no matter how many dis@@ approve of this idea .
as the lead@@ er of the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian Soci@@ alist delegation and as a presid@@ ent of the Inter@@ group for histor@@ ical national minorities , regional languages and constitutional regions , I welcome the Constitutional Treaty .
this Constitutional Treaty is of historic importance in many regards .
it is defin@@ i@@ tely so for national minorities , as it will be the first time in the history of the Union that national minority rights become part of the .
at last a working system can finally be established to protect minority rights within the European Union .
as a H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian Soci@@ alist , I am especially pro@@ ud that it was my government who initi@@ ated the sec@@ tion regarding minority groups .
millions of people bel@@ ong@@ ing to national minority groups will cel@@ eb@@ rate the Constitutional Treaty &apos;s coming into effect .
I represent a country where 10 % of the population is made up of minorities , and from a cultural point of view , one third of its people lives outside its national borders .
as a representative in the European Parliament , I had the right to say in the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian parliament &apos;s ratification debate that every country , including H@@ un@@ g@@ ary , shall now have two Con@@ stitu@@ tions .
the more gener@@ ous Constitution is to be obser@@ ved .
we must ensure that we always refer to the Constitution that grants more rights to our citizens , to the citizens of Europe .
all countries will become ric@@ her in this respect .
with regard to minority rights , the H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian Constitution is far more gener@@ ous than the European Constitutional Treaty , as it includes collective rights , acknowled@@ ges national minorities as decision @-@ making factors in legislation , and in addition to equal treatment , it emphas@@ ises the importance of fav@@ ourable treatment , positive discrimination and allows minorities to establish their own institutions of self @-@ government at all levels .
Mr President , there is pl@@ enty of criticism that could be le@@ ve@@ lled at the Constitutional Treaty , and , although the text is certainly an improvement on what we have at present , the question remains as to whether it is good enough .
in my view , there are a few mis@@ sed opportunities in a number of areas .
let us , for example , consider the election of the President of the European Commission .
as I see it , the European public , or at least the European Parliament , should be asked to vote .
indeed , that is what is stated in the new Constitution , but in the first instance there is only one candidate , as opposed to various candid@@ ates , so there is no choice .
the same applies to codecision : a won@@ der@@ ful European model , a broad majority of peoples and a political majority should apply across the board .
that may be what the Constitution sti@@ pu@@ la@@ tes , but very little will be put into practice right now .
it follows that there is room for much more efficiency and more democracy .
when it comes to rati@@ fying the Constitution , and certainly in countries where a referendum is to be held on it , the debate will not , though , be about sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties and the differences between the old and new situation .
that is a debate reser@@ ved for con@@ no@@ is@@ se@@ ur@@ s like us .
the treaty is about more than these innova@@ tions ; it is about the text as a whole .
we will be voting on a text which is an out@@ line of what we have buil@@ t up over 50 years of Europe - fif@@ ty years of peace , security , free movement of persons , goods , services and capital .
if I consider the opportunities and challenges which the Dutch , along with all Europeans , are able to take on in this large Union , then I have no doub@@ ts and vote in favour .
a referendum will be held in the Netherlands in a few months &quot; time .
I am already opposed to the argument that , as a result of the new Constitutional Treaty , the im@@ min@@ ent accession of Turkey would mean that small Member States , such as the Netherlands , would more or less dis@@ appear into obli@@ vi@@ on within the Union .
this is ra@@ b@@ ble @-@ ro@@ using , because Turkey is a separate decision and the public should , in my view , make up its own mind in a referendum when the time comes .
it is , however , also a sign of small @-@ min@@ ded thinking .
it is in the present institutional cha@@ os of Europe that large Member States can exer@@ t dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate amounts of influence , and small@@ er Member States benefit from law and order .
I am in favour of proper and democratic governance and against cha@@ os .
during the forthcoming referendum , the Dutch Liber@@ als will campaign actively in favour of the EU &apos;s new Constitutional Treaty .
Mr President , the wor@@ st sen@@ tence in the Constitution , which is in conflict with the basic idea of the Co@@ al and S@@ te@@ el Union , is &apos; Member States shall under@@ take prog@@ res@@ sively to improve their military capa@@ bilities . &quot;
if the purpose had been only to reduce the defence budget through greater efficiency , that is what would have been stated .
now , the clear aim is to increase the EU &apos;s military strik@@ ing power .
from dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment , we are now moving towards re@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment .
if we comb@@ ine this with the wor@@ ding to the effect that &apos; &#91; I &#93; n its relations with the wid@@ er world , the Union shall up@@ hold and promote its values and interests , &quot; we see a return to a 500 year @-@ old c@@ ol@@ on@@ ial policy .
this may cause an@@ xi@@ ety in the wid@@ er world , which re@@ members the last time we wanted to s@@ pread our civil@@ isation with the help of the ar@@ my .
it might perhaps create peace between ourselves , but in the world it will create an@@ xi@@ ety .
this is not a document for the future .
it is a return to old @-@ sty@@ le imperi@@ alism and c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ alism .
it is something I reject .
Mr President , I am in favour of rejec@@ ting the Constitution , as is all my group .
at the same time I would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament does not have competence in this matter .
this debate and the committee initiative report to be adopted , which is based on it , have no legal basis or value .
one reason why the Constitution should be rejected is that it means the mili@@ tar@@ isation of the European Union .
under the Constitution , Member States even have to agree to increase their military expenditure .
it is quite inc@@ redi@@ ble that there should be a provision on such a subject at the level of the EU Constitution .
governments of the Member States are be@@ having as if the Constitution were already in force .
it has been decided to establish 13 b@@ attle groups , and to e@@ qui@@ p them as if they were sho@@ ck tro@@ op@@ s .
in fact they are sho@@ ck tro@@ op@@ s , as the intention is to use them for illegal military operations just because the EU decid@@ es to .
we in the Convention did not adopt a r@@ ul@@ ing for the Constitution sta@@ ting that operations outside the EU &apos;s borders must always be law@@ ful - in other words , that they must always have a mandate from the United Nations .
the Constitution should be rejected , but let the people do it .
in fact , the people of just one nation will su@@ ffice .
Mr President , this is the first time dele@@ ga@@ tes have been present here who bring with them 50 years &quot; experience of life under tota@@ li@@ tari@@ an@@ ism .
today , although we are dealing with the draft European Constitution , I occasi@@ on@@ ally feel as if I am back in the old times .
an un@@ elected get @-@ together known as the Convention has produced a r@@ us@@ hed document .
in a similar way , a power@@ ful el@@ ite once made decisions in our country and then issu@@ ed its resolutions as pre@@ des@@ tin@@ ed ine@@ vi@@ tab@@ il@@ ities .
we are today being told that rejec@@ tion of the Constitution would cause a ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ he of cos@@ mic propor@@ tions .
life has ultimately shown that no ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ hes have oc@@ cur@@ red , and the same is true now .
a hy@@ bri@@ d structure mi@@ x@@ ing constitutional principles with practical policies has been developed , opening up b@@ oun@@ d@@ less scope for interpre@@ tation by un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able EU officials .
there is a par@@ all@@ el here , as well , as we too have had documents pass@@ ing decisions from our country to others without author@@ isation .
we are sitting here today in a Chamber ad@@ or@@ ned with la@@ v@@ ish bann@@ ers on the Constitution .
on such occasions , we too used to put up bann@@ ers and lis@@ ten to no@@ is@@ y br@@ as@@ s ban@@ ds , so that the ess@@ ence of the document which had been approved was ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed by the e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia .
we do not need a European Constitution , and what we certainly do not need is this fu@@ zz@@ y document we are about to vote on .
what we also do not need is to expen@@ d EU resources on spec@@ tac@@ ular cel@@ e@@ bra@@ tions .
we should do better to send the money to S@@ ri Lan@@ ka .
- Mr President , I speak on behalf of the new Italian Soci@@ alist Party .
we feel that we must warm@@ ly welcome the new European Constitution .
the Member States are trans@@ fer@@ ring a growing propor@@ tion of their soverei@@ gn@@ ty to benefit an ambitious global idea , where@@ by 25 countries tre@@ ad a common path together , side by side .
it is 21 years since this Chamber , by a large majority , adopted the plan to reform the European Union that had been drawn up by the Italian Member Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i .
it was a complex and d@@ aring plan , which was clearly designed to create a more integrated Community .
since then , little by little , the nations of the old continent have continued to add to and to develop the reasons for un@@ iting within this international framework , which has under@@ gone remar@@ ka@@ ble modi@@ fications and changes .
the Constitution , signed on 29 October in R@@ ome , just as in 19@@ 5@@ 7 , is a fundamental achiev@@ ement in that context .
half a century later , Europe &apos;s road has come back to the place where it all beg@@ an : an exc@@ iting new challenge involving us all in creating and building the Europe of tomorrow .
Mr President , as V@@ ice @-@ Cha@@ irman of the Convention , I can only re@@ jo@@ ice at the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ o@@ od of the European Parliament , tomorrow , and by an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority , declar@@ ing itself in favour of this Constitution .
although the European Parliament need not give its opinion form@@ ally for some time , this position on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , in my view , sen@@ ds a strong message to Europe .
it is true that we , in the Convention , tried to provide an answer to the challenges that Europe is facing , namely enlargement and globalisation , and this Constitution would not have as@@ sum@@ ed its present d@@ im@@ ensi@@ ons without the European Parliament &apos;s important contribution .
I think that this Constitution , although it is a compromise , has , in terms of quality , been a considerable step forward .
the Constitution provides the institutional framework that the enlarged Europe requires .
indeed , it is impossible for Europe to continue to work with the same institutions and the same rules as it did when there were fif@@ teen Member States .
at the same time , I think that the true dimension of this Constitution is that we , although the first step was taken at Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t , are only now really changing from an economic community to a political union : the end of the pill@@ ars , the commun@@ it@@ isation of the third pillar as regards the area of freedom and justice and a far more developed external policy , enab@@ ling Europe to speak with one voice in this glob@@ alised world .
although I hope that a large majority will support this Constitution tomorrow , let us not forget that we in this House carry a major responsibility in convinc@@ ing the Member States that Europe needs it .
I dec@@ l@@ are the session ad@@ jour@@ ned until 3 p.@@ m .
ladies and gentlemen , before the two votes which will take place today at noon , I should like to give the floor for one minu@@ te to Mr Mc@@ M@@ ill@@ an @-@ S@@ cot@@ t , Cha@@ irman of the Del@@ e@@ gation for O@@ b@@ ser@@ vation of the Palestinian Presid@@ ential E@@ lec@@ tions and V@@ ice @-@ President of the Parliament .
. Mr President , we have all re@@ turned saf@@ ely from Palestin@@ e .
I wish to thank my colleagues - there were 28 of us , the larg@@ est ever delegation of the European Parliament - the vice @-@ chairman , Mrs Na@@ pol@@ e@@ tan@@ o , and the staff who ac@@ compan@@ ied us and prepared the obser@@ vation mission .
our task , as Members of the European Parliament , is to del@@ iv@@ er an informed political ver@@ dic@@ t on this crucial election at the Brussels part @-@ session later this month .
however , we feel that the Palestinian people - especially the women - should be pro@@ ud .
in s@@ pite of the Israeli occu@@ pation and the lack of opportunity for East J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m resid@@ ents and others to vote , this election prepar@@ es the ground for the Palestinian parliamentary elections in July and could serve as a model for others in the region .
I hope that the European Parliament will respond to the app@@ et@@ ite for democracy in the Ara@@ b world as a whole .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
recommendation ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 01 / 2005 ) by J@@ am@@ es N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amen@@ ding Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 60 / 1999 la@@ ying down general provisions on the Structural Funds concerning the extension of the du@@ ration of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme and the gran@@ ting of new commitment appropriations ( 16@@ 0@@ 6@@ 4 / 2004 - COM ( 2004 ) 0@@ 6@@ 31 - C@@ 6 @-@ 02@@ 5@@ 2 / 2004 - 2004 / 02@@ 24 ( A@@ V@@ C ) )
. Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to address colleagues before , h@@ ope@@ fully , my report is voted through plenary .
the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme is of much more than pu@@ rely financial importance to Nor@@ thern Ireland and the border coun@@ ties of the Republic of Ireland .
it is the most visi@@ ble contribution so far by the European Union to building a stable society in Nor@@ thern Ireland and , to that extent , it has enormous symb@@ ol@@ ic value as well .
it is a fine example of the European Union offer@@ ing assistance without inter@@ fer@@ ing in the local political process .
on behalf of the people of Nor@@ thern Ireland , I thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that this report was able to go through its parliamentary sta@@ ges at speed .
I am grateful to the chairman and the sec@@ re@@ tari@@ at of the Committee on Regional Development for addres@@ sing the proposal as a priority once it was received from the Commission .
I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient hand@@ ling of the budgetary question , which has enab@@ led us to vote today .
whilst I am also grateful to the Council and the Commission , I regret that the British and Irish governments did not ask for a higher su@@ m of money .
the amount allocated fall@@ s somewhat short of initial expectations .
however , I am pleased that the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme is being extended and would be grateful for strong support for this sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of EU commitment to all the people of Nor@@ thern Ireland .
the next item is the election of the European Ombudsman .
the election will be held in accordance with Rule 19@@ 4 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I have received the following n@@ omin@@ ations :
- Mr N@@ ik@@ i@@ fo@@ ro@@ s Di@@ aman@@ dou@@ ro@@ s
- Mr G@@ i@@ us@@ ep@@ pe For@@ tu@@ na@@ to
two other n@@ omin@@ ations have been declar@@ ed in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sible .
( a sec@@ ret b@@ all@@ ot was held )
the outcome of the vote on the election of the European Ombudsman is as follows :
Members voting : 6@@ 4@@ 3
b@@ lan@@ k or vo@@ id b@@ all@@ ot paper@@ s : 34
votes c@@ ast : 6@@ 0@@ 9
majority required : 3@@ 0@@ 5
the results were as follows :
N@@ ik@@ i@@ fo@@ ro@@ s D@@ I@@ A@@ M@@ A@@ N@@ D@@ O@@ U@@ R@@ O@@ S 5@@ 6@@ 4 votes
G@@ i@@ us@@ ep@@ pe F@@ O@@ R@@ T@@ U@@ NATO 45 votes
the majority of votes c@@ ast were for Mr Di@@ aman@@ dou@@ ro@@ s , who is therefore elected European Ombudsman .
I would like to congratulate him on his election , and to call upon him to take an o@@ ath immediately before the Court of Justice , in accordance with Rule 19@@ 4 ( 7 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
. congratula@@ tions , Mr Di@@ aman@@ dou@@ ro@@ s .
we hope that you will pursue actively , as you did during your previous mandate , your activities under Article 19@@ 5 of the EC Treaty .
we know what a vital role the Ombudsman pla@@ ys , enhan@@ cing the responsibility of the Community administration , as well as sti@@ mula@@ ting thinking on practices and procedures .
I promis@@ e that the Commission will continue to work actively and closely with you .
the Commission is also aware of the fact that citizens are making increasing use of their right to compla@@ in to the European Ombudsman .
the number of compla@@ ints ro@@ se substan@@ ti@@ ally during the first ten months of last year , compared to the same period in 2003 .
this seems to mean that the rise in the number of compla@@ ints reflec@@ ts the fact that citizens know about their rights , rather than any wor@@ sen@@ ing in the administrative behaviour of European institutions - at least , that is what we hope .
the Commission is looking forward to improving its cooperation with the European Ombudsman .
we wish you all the best in your important work .
that conclu@@ des the vote .
recommendation : N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son ( A@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 01 / 2005 )
.
today I voted in favour of the extension of P@@ E@@ AC@@ E F@@ un@@ ding but I did so with considerable reser@@ vation .
that reser@@ vation ar@@ ises from the fact that , to date , P@@ E@@ AC@@ E F@@ un@@ ding in Nor@@ thern Ireland has been allocated in a most im@@ balanced way , to the gro@@ s@@ s dis@@ advantage to the Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ t / Uni@@ on@@ ist Community .
it has also fav@@ ou@@ red terrorist pris@@ on@@ er groups over victi@@ m groups , who exist as victims because of the hor@@ ro@@ r visi@@ ted upon them by those terrorists .
during this extension of P@@ E@@ AC@@ E F@@ un@@ ding I am looking for an over@@ t ri@@ ghting of these wr@@ ong@@ s .
this funding must be allocated in an even @-@ han@@ ded manner .
.
I am delighted to support this report and welcome the proposed extension of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme to cover this year and 2006 .
this decision will allow the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E measures , designed to support re@@ conciliation , to be carried on for another few years .
the contin@@ uation of these peace initiatives is in@@ valuable in re@@ building trust between communities and bringing communities together from both sides of the border .
peace foc@@ uses specifically on re@@ conciliation and the projects it has fun@@ ded have contribu@@ ted gre@@ atly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations .
I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 and sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that further provision will be made in the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives when they are finally established and come into effect in 2007 .
there is no doubt that our hop@@ es for a peaceful future depen@@ d on the good work of the various cross @-@ border and North @-@ South initiatives fun@@ ded under this programme .
the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme is justified as an internal matter for the EU .
the pla@@ yers that have the main and ultima@@ te responsibility for achieving a consolid@@ ation of the peace process are , however , Ireland and Gre@@ at Bri@@ tain .
as the June Lis@@ t se@@ es it , it is of crucial importance that economic aid not be used as a form of &apos; structural aid , &quot; but that it be used for bringing about real and practical improvements that promote positive development of the peace process in Nor@@ thern Ireland .
if it were only up to the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance , the draft Constitution would be much more ambitious than the one presented to us .
it would enable us to give substance to the political , social and ec@@ ological Europe that we cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on .
it would be a project with un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous and defin@@ ite objectives and not include this third part that , in merely ec@@ ho@@ ing the earlier tre@@ aties , is an obsta@@ cle to an ambitious global project for Europe .
in s@@ pite of its im@@ perfec@@ tions , I shall however vote , and call upon others to vote , in favour of this Constitutional Treaty , for it would be an ab@@ er@@ ration and a major political er@@ ro@@ r to th@@ row in one &apos;s lot with those opposed to the Constitution , on the pre@@ text that the final wor@@ ding is not commen@@ su@@ rate with what is at sta@@ ke .
we need Europe , even an im@@ perfec@@ t Europe , more than ever .
with a Constitution , we shall succeed in laun@@ ching this peace @-@ ori@@ ented Europe , the be@@ ar@@ er of common values such as human rights and democracy .
it is by taking this major step that Europeans will feel united in a genuine common project .
it is a mili@@ tant &apos; yes &quot; that I shall stand up for in voting on the Cor@@ bet@@ t report .
not to rise to this historic occasion would be to den@@ y our own work as buil@@ ders of Europe and would , for some considerable time , in@@ hi@@ bit what we wish to see , namely the ambitious development of European integration ...
.
I congratulate Mr N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son on his excellent work on the recommendation concerning the extension of the du@@ ration of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme .
the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme , which was started in 1995 , is aimed at fos@@ tering peace and re@@ conciliation in Nor@@ thern Ireland and in border areas of the Republic of Ireland .
following the success of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E I programme , the Berl@@ in European Council of 1999 decided to extend the programme for a further five years , in order to provide continu@@ ity to the projects that had been set up .
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;s position that in this region of Europe , which has en@@ du@@ red over 30 years of violence , all ener@@ g@@ ies should be chan@@ ne@@ lled into making it possible to maintain social inclu@@ sion , economic development and employment , ur@@ ban and rural reg@@ ener@@ ation and cross @-@ border cooperation .
it is therefore essential to extend the implementation of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme by two years , until the end of 2006 , co@@ inc@@ id@@ ing with the program@@ ming period for the Structural Funds and with a proposal to extend the annual Community contribution to the International Fund for Ireland for the same period .
the wid@@ er aim , therefore , is to al@@ ign the measures finan@@ ced by these two instruments with interven@@ tions carried out in the region under EU cohesion policy .
.
I welcome this report , which form@@ ally gives the bac@@ king of the European Parliament to continued EU funding for the European Pe@@ ace Fund until the year 2006 .
in 2005 and 2006 , EUR 10@@ 8 million are being allocated to this fund which is supporting projects in the border coun@@ ty region and Nor@@ thern Ireland .
one third of this fund , EUR 36 million , will be spent in the border coun@@ ty region , the remain@@ ing EUR 7@@ 2 million being spent in Nor@@ thern Ireland .
the European Pe@@ ace Fund 2000 @-@ 2004 supported 4 000 projects in Nor@@ thern Ireland and the border coun@@ ty region alone .
the European Union also gives EUR 15 million a year towards the International Fund for Ireland and has supported con@@ secu@@ tive Inter@@ re@@ g programmes d@@ ating back to the late 198@@ 0@@ s .
in the overall context of the peace process in Ireland , the European Union has been at the fo@@ ref@@ ron@@ t in providing political and financial support - and it is clear that it will continue to play an active and central role in this regard .
.
I voted in favour of Mr N@@ ic@@ hol@@ son &apos;s report on the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme for Nor@@ thern Ireland , because I feel that it is extremely important for the EU to show solidarity with the Irish peace process .
our solidarity should be chan@@ ne@@ lled into benef@@ iting the wide range of sectors , groups and communities wor@@ st affected by the violence , and into fos@@ tering in@@ ter @-@ community projects .
financial management through loc@@ ally @-@ based partnership structures and sec@@ tor@@ ally speci@@ alised non @-@ governmental organisations will help to strengthen the ties of peace and re@@ conciliation that are crucial to sta@@ bil@@ isation in Nor@@ thern Ireland .
I also consider essential the objective of financial consisten@@ cy that has been set out as a result of the extension of the implementation of the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E programme for a further two years , given that it constitu@@ tes a step towards al@@ ig@@ ning the actions finan@@ ced by this instrument and by the International Fund for Ireland with interven@@ tions carried out in the region under the EU cohesion policy .
.
in a Europe that has proved capable of building peace within its borders , p@@ hen@@ om@@ ena such as those in Nor@@ thern Ireland and the Bas@@ que Coun@@ try have , for@@ tunately , become fe@@ wer and f@@ ar@@ ther between .
given the serious nature of these situations , however , the EU must continue to condemn ve@@ hem@@ ently and un@@ cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ally the use of violence as a means of sol@@ ving political issues .
in the context of the ce@@ ase@@ fir@@ e initiatives and the opening of negotiations between the two sides in the Nor@@ thern Ireland conflict , I feel that similar determination must be shown as regards any initiatives intended to help establish las@@ ting peace in those territor@@ ies .
against this back@@ dro@@ p , I welcome the fact that financial support is to be maintained for Nor@@ thern Ireland and for border areas of the Republic of Ireland , and that the P@@ E@@ AC@@ E II programme is to be extended for a further two years .
we are therefore continuing with the debate on the report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe .
- Mr President , Mr V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , the new Treaty is a positive step from an institutional point of view , as everyone has pointed out .
the new Treaty gives us a Union that is str@@ onger , more democratic and closer to the citizens .
it is also a Constitution which , most importan@@ tly , represents shared values and is a political project .
we see this stra@@ i@@ gh@@ ta@@ way with the constitu@@ tion@@ alisation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is aimed at creating a society that se@@ es itself as a social market economy and that targets full employment .
these are not m@@ ere words ; they are the EU &apos;s new objectives , which are en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in Article 3 of Par@@ t 1 of the Treaty and which must gu@@ ide all of its actions and policies .
Article 18@@ 5 of Par@@ t I@@ II on monetary policy , for example , expres@@ s@@ ly states that , without pre@@ jud@@ ice to the objective of price stability , the European S@@ yste@@ m of Central Ban@@ ks supports the general economic policies in the Union in order to contribute to the achiev@@ ement of its objectives as laid down in Article I @-@ 3 .
hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal application c@@ laus@@ es should also be highli@@ ghted .
these c@@ laus@@ es gu@@ ide the Union &apos;s actions and policies laid down in Par@@ t I@@ II of the Treaty .
accord@@ ingly , Ar@@ tic@@ les 1@@ 15 to 12@@ 2 of Par@@ t I@@ II , for example , state that the various policies of the EU must ensure that equality between men and women is promo@@ ted , that the environment is protected , that consumers are protected , that social rights such as employment are guaranteed and that public services or services of general economic interest have the necessary conditions to fulfil their mis@@ sions .
these examples show how the new Treaty strength@@ ens the European social model .
it does not back@@ tra@@ ck on any ga@@ ins that have been made and en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es new and important advan@@ ces .
it is therefore good ne@@ ws , in that it gives tan@@ gible form to our desire to live in a society with high levels of social protection and high environmental values .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , five years ago , there were some of us in this House who wis@@ hed to re@@ vi@@ ve S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i &apos;s C@@ ro@@ co@@ d@@ ile C@@ lu@@ b .
at that time , we started a feder@@ alist cross @-@ party group designed to work towards a European Constitution .
there were many who lau@@ gh@@ ed in a rather ind@@ ul@@ g@@ ent way then .
in my home country of Sweden , I was pat@@ ted on the head when I tal@@ ked about the need for a common document that clearly stated what we stand for , why we stand for those things and how we work .
now , no one is lau@@ gh@@ ing any more , and talking about a European Constitution is not especially contro@@ versi@@ al .
most people are in favour of it .
through the Convention and through hard work , especially here in the European Parliament , we now have a draft European Constitution .
that is f@@ anta@@ s@@ tic progress .
it makes the EU str@@ onger , more open and more democratic , pu@@ ts the citizen centre stage and simp@@ lif@@ ies decision @-@ making .
Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t &apos;s and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o &apos;s resolution gives a very sound and ins@@ truc@@ tive account of the advantages of the new Constitution and is a document that can in actual fact be used in the campaign , since it is written in such an edu@@ ca@@ tional way .
certainly , a lot could have been better , and many fellow MEPs have tal@@ ked about the fact in this House .
personally , I should have lik@@ ed to have seen a cle@@ ar@@ er dem@@ ar@@ cation of the EU &apos;s powers .
with so many Member States , it would have been sensible to concentra@@ te upon rather fe@@ wer issues at EU level so as to be more effective in these areas .
I should also have lik@@ ed to have seen the permanent President placed not in the Council but in the Commission .
finally , I regret that the Convention did not discuss the issue of the European Parliament &apos;s se@@ at .
we must stop this com@@ mu@@ ting between Strasbourg and Brussels .
it is expen@@ sive and ine@@ fficient and , as long as it goes on , people will never fully trust this institution .
a new er@@ a is on the way .
we shall be able to adopt new reforms and shall be able in the future to take further steps with a view to the next Convention and the next Constitution .
firstly , the present Constitution must be rati@@ fied and , overall , this is a very good draft .
it constitu@@ tes progress for European democracy and for our citizens .
op@@ pon@@ ents must bear in mind that the alternative is the Treaty of Nice , which does not in any way increase democracy within the EU .
nor does the Treaty of Nice make it any easier for us to cooperate with so many Member States .
I am therefore looking forward with great en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m to the debate that is now in the off@@ ing and that is already going on in the various Member States and to being out with you on the stre@@ ets and in market@@ places def@@ ending the European Constitution .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , together with the F@@ lem@@ ish Gre@@ ens , I will , over the next few months , be conduc@@ ting a campaign for Belgian ratification of the Constitution in the feder@@ al , F@@ lem@@ ish and Brussels parliaments .
tomorrow , however , we are not voting on the Constitution , but on the report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , which I regard as disap@@ poin@@ ting .
it is an a@@ pol@@ og@@ y , an exces@@ sively one @-@ si@@ ded en@@ u@@ mer@@ ation of the Constitution &apos;s many benefits .
what a mis@@ sed opportunity , Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t !
should we not have given more consideration to the criticism that is now being le@@ ve@@ lled by the L@@ ef@@ t ?
why , for example , is it not possible to state that we are still on our way towards a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged European democracy , that the role of the constitutional regions is s@@ no@@ wed under , that too many areas of policy are still left for inter@@ governmental cooperation , that there are too many areas in which the ve@@ to still applies ?
why can it not be said that the European Union is still too much in need of a social order , and that its ori@@ entation is too ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al ?
that is why I would ask you to re@@ visit the amendments tabled by the Group of the Gre@@ ens / European Fre@@ e A@@ lli@@ ance , particularly Amendments Nos 4 , 9 , 15 and 16 and , I hope , support them when we vote tomorrow .
- Mr President , among the various reasons for our opposition to this new Treaty I should like to highlight the fact that it reinfor@@ ces cen@@ tr@@ alism , feder@@ alism and European bureauc@@ racy , that it calls for policies applic@@ able to all Member States of the Union , ir@@ respec@@ tive of their actual situations , and that it emb@@ ed@@ s ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ alism and the mili@@ tar@@ isation of Europe more deep@@ ly .
the b@@ lin@@ d im@@ positions of the Stability and Growth Pact , the European Central Bank and the monetary and single currency policies in the euro zone , regar@@ d@@ less of the reality of each individual country , have led to a de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation in the social situation , to an increase in ine@@ qu@@ alities ar@@ ising from the priva@@ tis@@ ation of strategic sectors and public services and to app@@ all@@ ing attacks on workers &quot; rights .
we have also seen how these practices in agriculture , fisheries and in external trade policy have led to economic rec@@ es@@ sions , to unemployment and to the coll@@ ap@@ se of production in increasingly large sectors in countries with we@@ ak@@ er econom@@ ies .
by the same to@@ ken , we cannot accept the promotion campaign for the new Treaty , which is s@@ car@@ c@@ ely democratic and certainly not pl@@ ur@@ alist , based as it is on the arguments of its suppor@@ ters , dis@@ regarding the arguments of those who are opposed to it , those fighting for a more social , more democratic Europe foun@@ ded on the principle of soverei@@ g@@ n States with equal rights and committed to peace .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a Constitution should la@@ y down the ground rules for policy and the rights due to citizens of a democracy .
a Constitution should not establish the content of policy .
social policy and policy relating to tax@@ es , energy , polic@@ ing and issues concerned with al@@ co@@ ho@@ l should be drawn up by the people of each country , ac@@ ting together through the democratic process .
when the will of the people changes in a country , it must be possible for policy to be changed .
the draft with which we are now conf@@ ron@@ ted is something quite different .
it is an expression of the political clas@@ s &apos;s own amb@@ itions for the European project .
it regula@@ tes in detail ; it de@@ als with tou@@ rism and agriculture ; it legitim@@ ises a cor@@ por@@ ate society ; it forces each Member State into a currency union ; and it points towards a concentra@@ tion of power and a Europe govern@@ ed by tech@@ no@@ c@@ rats .
what is presented here as a Constitution is an attempt by the political establishment to us@@ ur@@ p the European peoples &quot; democratic right to sha@@ pe their own fu@@ tures .
that is why the June Lis@@ t re@@ jects this draft .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the task of European integration has brought about the world &apos;s larg@@ est area of law and economic freedom , but the organisation of our continent cannot stop there .
Europe must become a political pla@@ yer , a political uni@@ t en@@ do@@ wed with democratic power and diplom@@ atic cl@@ out .
we want a Europe of states and peoples and , consequently , we wish to strengthen people &apos;s confidence in the European Union .
that is indeed what is proposed by the Constitution signed in R@@ ome .
I again congratulate our rapporteurs , Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , and would emphasise the progress made through the new Treaty .
the rapporteurs are sen@@ ding out a clear message to our fellow citizens : the Constitution is fine , with the best possible wor@@ ding .
it proposes a more integrated , more efficient and more political Europe which is more atten@@ tive to people and str@@ onger both inter@@ n@@ ally and ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
the Constitution , as such , does not increase the competences of the EU .
it preven@@ ts the emerg@@ ence of a cen@@ tr@@ alised super@@ state , it sanctions the legal person@@ ality of the EU and it gives the EU a human face in the form of a long @-@ term President and a Foreign Minister .
it also guarantees all our fellow citizens protection under the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
the European Parliament is ga@@ ining ground on the European political stage .
finally , the Constitution facilita@@ tes rec@@ our@@ se to enhan@@ ced cooperation , making it possible to face up to what will be at sta@@ ke in the future .
the des@@ tin@@ y of a European country is now in@@ separ@@ able from the aff@@ ir@@ mation of its European person@@ ality .
the Constitution represents the best way for our Member States to conf@@ ron@@ t the future , starting from now .
for them to be united around a document that they have all approved is very ambitious .
what now will turn this amb@@ ition into a reality is the will of politicians and , in the first place , of ourselves .
Mr President , the Dutch delegation within the Soci@@ alist Group in the European Parliament believes that the debate is about the Constitution rather than about whether we are in favour of Europe or against it .
we are in favour , with reser@@ vations , because what matters to us are the benefits of the new Constitution compared to the Treaty of Nice .
the Europe of Nice is un@@ decided as to how significant it is .
the new Treaty , however , guarantees the influence of regional , dec@@ entr@@ alised authorities , and desig@@ na@@ tes the national parliament as a w@@ at@@ c@@ hd@@ o@@ g , so that Europe , rather than threa@@ tening to turn into a super@@ state , provides effective and cross @-@ border cooperation in respect of crime and food safety .
in addition , in the new Constitution , more than 30 types of decisions have been re@@ placed by a hand@@ ful of terms read@@ ily recogn@@ is@@ able by the public , including &apos; law &quot; and &apos; enab@@ ling legislation . &quot;
with this , the Constitution introduc@@ es more clar@@ ity about the type of Europe we would like and decision @-@ making that we use to that end .
the Constitution also brings us more effectiveness by exten@@ ding the number of areas in which decisions are taken by qualified majority , thus ensuring that one country cannot put a sp@@ ann@@ er in the works .
more democratic accoun@@ tability is introduced by remo@@ val of much decision @-@ making from the back@@ ro@@ oms , and by making the Council &apos;s decision @-@ making meetings public .
finally , the Constitution brings us more rights for the citizens : social dialogue , the inclu@@ sion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as well as the citizens &quot; initiative , of course .
anyone who fail@@ s to support this important step in the European integration process will become responsible for per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating the present Treaty of Nice , which is more bureauc@@ ratic , s@@ lower , and in many ways un@@ democratic .
our &apos; yes &quot; is one that is t@@ ing@@ ed with a critical obser@@ vation , because Europe is still very much la@@ cking one voice .
social Europe is still ina@@ dequ@@ ately an@@ cho@@ red ; hence a critical &apos; yes . &quot;
in short , the Dutch delegation within the PSE Group gives a critical &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution .
around the referendum in the s@@ pring , we will be en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tically advoc@@ ating this position , supported by Joh@@ an C@@ ru@@ y@@ ff , Ca@@ tal@@ an D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man or Dutch Ca@@ tal@@ an in the Spanish campaign .
in that way , we are hop@@ ing to gain support in the Netherlands for this new project , the new Constitution .
Mr President , Ireland held two referen@@ da on the Nice Treaty : in the first we voted &apos; No &apos; and in the second we voted &apos; Y@@ es &apos; .
there were many reasons for this , but an over@@ rid@@ ing one was that our government took its citizens for granted .
the Irish had always voted &apos; Y@@ es &apos; to Europe , so this time they thought it would be the same .
however , on this occasion , the politicians got it wrong .
we have to learn from our mis@@ takes and ensure that , this time , citizens have easy access to all the information they require .
I would go so far as to suggest that every hou@@ se@@ hold should receive a c@@ op@@ y of the draft Treaty - certainly every hou@@ se@@ hold that requests one .
this will be expen@@ sive , but it is well worth pa@@ ying that price .
furthermore , I would very strongly support a sugges@@ tion to publis@@ h a document out@@ lin@@ ing , on the one hand , what is already in place in the existing Treaties and , on the other , out@@ lin@@ ing what is new , changed or different .
un@@ like the as@@ ser@@ tions from some speakers in this House today , this is not tell@@ ing people what to do or how to think ; it is giving our citizens a choice .
if you were sitting a public examin@@ ation in Ireland , you might be asked to compar@@ e and contr@@ ast .
this is what we need to do : to ass@@ ess if what we now have is an improvement or otherwise .
in s@@ pite of the s@@ ca@@ thing refer@@ ences of many Euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tics , I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ rail or the Sec@@ ond Com@@ ing , but it is a positive step forward for Europe and one that I will support .
I have many reasons for saying this , but time allows me to mention just one today .
this Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens .
for example , a million citizens &apos; sig@@ na@@ tures can pro@@ mp@@ t the Commission to draft a proposal .
that is people power !
just imag@@ ine the pos@@ sibilities : citizens from Lat@@ via , Spain , Ireland or Sweden , for example , finding common cause and deman@@ ding action .
surely , that is the possibility of a citizens &apos; Europe !
Mr President , there are some things to ad@@ mi@@ re in this Constitution but there are also many things to dis@@ like .
on balance my party has decided that it cannot recommen@@ d it to the people of S@@ cot@@ land , and accord@@ ingly will not be voting for the report .
we have a number of objec@@ tions to the Constitution itself , but in the secon@@ ds remain@@ ing I will simply mention the ina@@ dequate subsidiarity provisions .
S@@ cot@@ land is not independent yet , but the S@@ cot@@ t@@ ish Parliament is already the only body responsible for justice , the environment , education , health and many other areas of S@@ cot@@ t@@ ish life .
the provisions in this Treaty for incorpor@@ ating it into the EU law @-@ making process are ina@@ dequate .
we have seen in the field of fisheries the disas@@ tro@@ us consequences of EU legislation being ina@@ dequ@@ ately sensitive to reality on the ground within the Member States or territor@@ ies of the Union , and this Constitution will not suffici@@ ently improve EU law @-@ making for S@@ cot@@ land .
more to the point , it does not take account of the dignity of my country .
we cannot recommen@@ d it to the people of S@@ cot@@ land and will not be voting for it .
Mr President , I am from a country with a constitution that en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es the truth about fundamental human rights : the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity ; the truth that a su@@ pre@@ me being , not a m@@ ere human institution , gave these rights to us - all of us without excep@@ tion .
in Ireland we have had governments which have ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted or even den@@ ied our rights , but under the sh@@ el@@ ter of our constitution , even the most v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able of us can demand them .
the EU Constitution ex@@ p@@ oun@@ ds the fal@@ se position that the EU cre@@ ates all rights , even fundamental rights .
here , the EU is not the guar@@ di@@ an of rights , but the giv@@ er .
I would not dre@@ am of supporting this Constitution .
it has not g@@ ras@@ p@@ ed the simple and important truth of fundamental human rights .
history tell@@ s us that when human institutions become the giv@@ er of rights , rights become gi@@ f@@ ts .
they can be bes@@ to@@ wed sel@@ ec@@ tively , den@@ ied , or even take back .
I will support the truth that the fundamental rights of the human person are from G@@ od .
I will defend the Irish constitution against us@@ ur@@ pation .
- Mr President , first of all I believe that we need to express our gra@@ t@@ itude to the members of the Convention on the F@@ u@@ ture of Europe who prepared this Constitution and , at the same time , to congratulate the head@@ s of the Member States who signed the Constitution on 29 October 2004 .
nor should we forget the chairman of the Convention , Mr G@@ is@@ c@@ ard d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing , whom we need to thank .
I do not intend to repeat everything that has been said in favour of the Constitution or everything that has been written in the rapporteurs &apos; report or everything said by the rapporteurs .
I fully endorse everything that has been said and I congratulate them on the excellent report which they have submitted .
I sinc@@ er@@ ely congratulate both Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ ο .
Τ@@ he text of the Constitution which we are deb@@ ating is not by any means perfec@@ t , as everyone has said .
however , it is the best which there could be under current political circumstances .
it cre@@ ates a more democratic and more operational Union and makes it more credi@@ ble and val@@ id both at home and ab@@ road .
the European Union is going down in global history as a union of states which aims to serve values .
man , the European citizen , the individual , stands at the ep@@ ic@@ en@@ tre of the constitutional arrangements .
humanitarian solidarity is also trans@@ fer@@ red to state level with the provision on the defence of a Member State in the event of attack against it .
it is precisely this solidarity which I emphasise in the amendment which I have tabled and I call on you to vote for it .
the adoption of the Constitution for Europe is a huge step forward .
it is a mil@@ es@@ t@@ one on the road to the future .
those who do not believe in the European Union will naturally find cle@@ ver legal ex@@ cus@@ es for political pre@@ texts to der@@ ide the Constitution and they have every right to do so .
however , they should respect one thing : that their governments , all the governments have signed this Constitution .
that is why , ir@@ respec@@ tive of the reser@@ vations and the individual objec@@ tions which we have , we all need to act and work for the approval of this Constitution , for its ratification by all the Member States
supporting this truly excellent report gives the European Parliament both a great opportunity and a great responsibility to encourage our European fellow citizens to support the European Constitutional Treaty .
our message to the citizens whom we represent here is that the accep@@ tance of the European Constitutional Treaty is a truly excep@@ tional step forward in the development of our common European home and that it is indeed a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for its progress in all areas .
it is but a step from European diplom@@ acy to European democracy .
if the wor@@ st were to happen , and for these or other reasons the agreement were not to be rati@@ fied , this would not simply be a case of Europe running in place ; it would be a significant and a dangerous step back@@ wards .
it would end@@ ang@@ er our efforts to bring about a future that seeks not only peace , but economic and social progress ; a future in which a democratic Europe will remain an active and influ@@ ential pla@@ yer on the international political stage .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteurs .
however , I would like to ask for more noise and ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment over the small clause , under &apos; particip@@ atory democracy &apos; , that de@@ als with the citizens &apos; right of initiative .
this , above all , makes a reality of bringing Europe closer to its citizens .
it buil@@ ds on the right to pet@@ ition , but more than that it is a positive right that allows our citizens to begin to set the agenda .
in my own country , in compar@@ is@@ on , citizens have no right of initiative , pet@@ itions lan@@ gu@@ ish on sh@@ el@@ ves , legislative initiatives rely on parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans w@@ inning a b@@ all@@ ot - it is a sort of ga@@ me of chance - and even then the initiative will probably be tal@@ ked out by colleagues , with the citizens having no real place .
I am very pro@@ ud that this n@@ as@@ cent EU right off@@ ers more : a real opportunity for our citizens to participate in and to move Europe .
let us therefore have a lou@@ d f@@ an@@ fare for this step towards direct democracy , European @-@ sty@@ le .
Mr President , we are all aware that the Constitutional Treaty is bad ne@@ ws .
it is legal n@@ on@@ sense , it is over@@ ly complex and it is rid@@ d@@ led with ide@@ ology .
the th@@ ic@@ k tom@@ es of several hun@@ d@@ red pa@@ ges are in@@ comprehen@@ sible to the average citizen of an EU Member State .
they are written in the spirit of the French R@@ ev@@ olution - an en@@ li@@ gh@@ tened , re@@ v@@ olu@@ tionary and sec@@ ular spirit .
there is no room in the Treaty for G@@ od or traditional , European , Christian , R@@ oman , Greek and Latin values .
there is no room either for the values that are de@@ ar to us , such as the nation , the family , human life , fa@@ it@@ h and trad@@ itions .
these values have been re@@ placed by sec@@ ular , soci@@ alist , stu@@ pid and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re values , such as the wor@@ ship of M@@ other E@@ ar@@ th , or rather G@@ a@@ ia , rights for hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ als and power for Brussels bureauc@@ rats .
this is something we cannot con@@ sent to and never will .
the report we are deb@@ ating is mis@@ leading , bi@@ ased and dec@@ ep@@ tive .
it is pur@@ e pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da , and only has positive things to say about the Treaty .
where is the truth in all of this ?
you should be as@@ ha@@ med of y@@ ourselves !
a bi@@ ased report full of pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da has been produced and distribu@@ ted at the expen@@ se of the citizens of the Member States , and it is a sta@@ in on the con@@ sci@@ ence of the European Parliament .
we should be as@@ ha@@ med of ourselves .
the re@@ v@@ olution must truly have gone a long way for the truth to be ab@@ used in such a fas@@ hi@@ on .
for@@ tunately , Pol@@ and will reject this Treaty , and I hope other countries will follow su@@ it .
the L@@ eag@@ ue of Pol@@ ish F@@ am@@ il@@ ies and the In@@ depend@@ ence and Democ@@ racy Group will vote against the report .
&apos;@@ No &quot; to the Constitutional Treaty !
Mr President , I should like to begin by saying that I cannot agree with the previous speak@@ er .
I should like to express my sinc@@ ere thanks to all the members of the European Convention .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats made a particularly valuable contribution to this Convention , something which as a young ME@@ P I was particularly glad to see .
Mr T@@ eu@@ fe@@ l , Mr Bro@@ k and Mr W@@ u@@ er@@ mel@@ ing are na@@ mes that deser@@ ve mention in this connection , but I should like to thank each and every one of the partici@@ pan@@ ts for the work they carried out during a period of such crucial importance for the future of Europe .
I found it all the more regretta@@ ble that the Council , not long after the Convention had comple@@ ted its democratic work , used an urgent procedure to revis@@ e its outcome to bring it into line with its wishes .
it is unfor@@ tun@@ ate that the democratic nature of the Convention &apos;s work was somewhat tar@@ n@@ ished as a result of this .
nevertheless , I support the Constitution and do not believe that it requires detailed explan@@ ations , as the previous speak@@ er said , but that it cre@@ ates a clear , transparent and more citizen @-@ fri@@ en@@ dly Europe .
if I may go into detail on one point , I believe that one aspect of the Constitution which represents major progress is the fact that cooperation between the European Parliament , on the one hand , and the national parliaments , on the other , will improve our contac@@ ts with the national parliaments , and enable us to gain a more detailed idea of how the legislation for which we often merely la@@ y down the framework is trans@@ posed directly in the nation states .
particularly help@@ ful in this regard is the fact that we have a clear del@@ ine@@ ation of competences between national and European levels , and the early @-@ war@@ ning system for subsidiarity monitoring will also have a positive impact .
I therefore hope that regulation of a cle@@ ar@@ er and more transparent structure of competences , and the early @-@ war@@ ning system for subsidiarity monitoring , will allow us to achieve more effective and better cooperation with our national colleagues , in order to make legislation in Europe even more transparent .
Mr President , any community in which the separ@@ ation of powers is not sti@@ pu@@ la@@ ted and the security of rights is not guaranteed needs a Constitution .
that was stated in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of the Rights of M@@ an and of the C@@ itiz@@ en of 17@@ 8@@ 9 .
we have wis@@ hed to follow the path which more than two cen@@ tu@@ ries ago led to the freedom of people and peoples and , therefore , through this Constitution we will have more and better Europe .
through this Constitution we are restor@@ ing the im@@ pe@@ tus of the Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t Treaty , we are over@@ coming the failure of the Treaty of Nice and we are bringing enlargement and further Europe@@ an@@ isation together , in real time .
naturally , through this Constitution , the Union will have more legitim@@ acy , more values , more rights , more democracy and more efficiency in terms of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ; the European Security and Def@@ ence Policy ; the A@@ re@@ a of Freed@@ om , Security and Justice ; and also social Europe .
I would like to stress the support of the European Con@@ feder@@ ation of Trade Uni@@ ons for the European Constitution , which I believe to be truly essential and fundamental .
this Constitution will have to be improved and , of course , applied and developed amb@@ iti@@ ously when the time comes .
no Constitution is perfec@@ t , but no Constitution can be improved unless it en@@ ters into force .
we must therefore achieve its ratification on time and correc@@ tly .
and we will do all of this with sufficient maj@@ orities to continue moving forward .
this is a citizen &apos;s Constitution which must be perc@@ eiv@@ ed as such .
in Spain , on 20 February , we have a date with a referendum , with two good friends : a Constitution and Europe .
we will be there .
Mr President , we face many my@@ ths and red her@@ r@@ ings as we try to promote the debate on the EU Constitution .
Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o have done an excellent job in their clear and stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward explanation and advoc@@ acy of its mer@@ its .
Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t , I shall probably b@@ or@@ row your wor@@ ding for a pa@@ mp@@ h@@ let in my constitu@@ ency , but this is in a common good cause .
one of the red her@@ r@@ ings put around is whether to call the document a &apos; Constitutional Treaty &apos; or a &apos; constitution &apos; , but , as the auth@@ ors say , this is a ster@@ ile debate .
it is a treaty in form , but a constitution in substance .
why are so many people , at least in my own country , Bri@@ tain , so fri@@ gh@@ tened of the word constitution ?
every c@@ lu@@ b , every society has one .
in fact the UK itself has one , even though it has never been written down all in one place - unfortunately !
the greatest benefits of the new Constitution are that , on the one hand , it con@@ stra@@ ins the EU , but on the other , it liber@@ ates it .
the powers of the European Union will be con@@ stra@@ ined by strength@@ ened rules on limits to competence , on parliamentary scru@@ tin@@ y , on democratic accoun@@ tability and the definition of citizens &apos; rights v@@ is @-@ à @-@ v@@ is the administration .
but the Union will also be fre@@ ed up to act more effectively on the domestic and external challenges we face .
dom@@ es@@ tically , this is most strik@@ ing in the case of justice and home affairs .
we will be able to act more decisi@@ vely to manage our borders and immigration and to tackle serious crime , as our citizens want us to do .
we will also be able to act more effectively ab@@ road .
what an impact it would have made on our public opinion , as well as on the disaster effort , if it had been , for example , a French air@@ cra@@ ft car@@ ri@@ er with German hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters and British mar@@ ines assis@@ ting in A@@ ce@@ h in Indon@@ es@@ ia , and not just American ones .
some claim to see in the Charter of Fundamental Rights - which will become leg@@ ally binding - a threat .
I see it as an opportunity .
the anti @-@ Europeans have to understand that it will sometimes act in the sense of con@@ stra@@ ining the EU institutions and giving re@@ d@@ ress against abuse of powers by them .
there is therefore no reason for people to fear and every reason to welcome the Constitution - and indeed this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the draft European Constitution makes the European citizen a major pla@@ yer in the construction of a united Europe .
the draft Constitution will be subject to the approval of our countries .
H@@ un@@ g@@ ary and Li@@ thu@@ ania have already said yes to it , and that is something about which we are delighted .
in the form of a single document that is more easi@@ ly read@@ able than the current tre@@ aties , the Constitution re@@ aff@@ ir@@ ms the double legitim@@ acy of a Union of states and of citizens .
the Council of Ministers will reach its decisions on a qualified majority basis in a greater number of areas .
the Presidency of the European Council will be sta@@ bil@@ ised with a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year term of office .
the Commission will see the number of its members reduced and its coordination strength@@ ened .
ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally , the ap@@ poin@@ tment of a European Foreign Minister will finally enable Europe to speak with a single voice outside our common borders .
the dra@@ ma of the ti@@ d@@ al wa@@ ve in South @-@ East Asia ill@@ ustra@@ tes once again the importance of such visi@@ bility and of the increased coordination of European action in the world .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , together with the Commissioner , have detailed the democratic progress represented by the draft European Constitution .
the Constitution will also enable Europeans over@@ se@@ as to as@@ ser@@ t their particular ass@@ ets and to contribute to the emerg@@ ence of an active new European fron@@ ti@@ er , a show@@ case for progress in solidarity and diversity .
Europeans have everything to gain from ap@@ prov@@ ing the ratification of the European Constitution .
they will become its major pro@@ pon@@ ents and enable the European Union to func@@ tion better and with more clar@@ ity and transparency , while at the same time establishing a balanced and stable distribution of powers at the different levels of decision @-@ making : European , national and regional .
Mr President , following the example of our group , the Belgian Soci@@ alist delegation will vote in favour of this report , which gives its support to a document that constitu@@ tes an important stage on the road to European integration .
Parliament &apos;s decision will be crucial , democra@@ tically and politically , to the debates that will be conduc@@ ted within the framework of the processes of ratification .
our own decision will be one in favour , even though our &apos; yes &quot; vote will be designed to ring up the cur@@ tain , not to ring it down .
in other words , it will be a comb@@ ative &apos; yes , &quot; which should signal a beginning and not an end .
it will be a decision in the aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive because , as many of us have pointed out , this Treaty pres@@ ents significant advan@@ ces .
how , indeed , can there not be deli@@ ght about the fact that the Constitutional Treaty grants our Parliament new and increased powers , thereby im@@ pos@@ ing a democratic debate within the only European institution en@@ do@@ wed with the legitim@@ acy of univers@@ al su@@ ff@@ ra@@ ge ?
how , too , can there not be agreement to integra@@ ting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the body of the Constitutional Treaty ?
our decision will be &apos; yes , &quot; but a &apos; yes &quot; designed to start the b@@ all ro@@ lling and with a price atta@@ ched .
when it comes to decisions taken by the Council of Ministers , it will not have es@@ cap@@ ed the atten@@ tive read@@ er that , although the double majority rule has been extended , the unanim@@ ity rule has been maintained for a number of crucial decisions , including those relating to the social sp@@ here and to taxation .
in the same way , a number of us are al@@ armed that a Constitution should include , emb@@ ed@@ ded within its wor@@ ding , a part that is program@@ matic in nature and with which we cannot all agree .
the document is not perfec@@ t .
it will be difficult to progress matters in certain social or fis@@ cal areas , but no more difficult than at present .
what is important is to become aware of the fact that this Constitution is only a stage in European integration .
it is mean@@ ing@@ ful only if it her@@ al@@ ds an ambitious future project in which all European citizens , beginning with the least aff@@ lu@@ ent , can g@@ lim@@ p@@ se , and hope for , an improvement in their conditions of life .
more than in terms of the Constitution , the EU will be jud@@ ged in terms of the subsequ@@ ent actions that it will , or will not , promote and in terms of the streng@@ th and political will with which it respon@@ ds , or does not respond , to Europeans &quot; hop@@ es of bringing about , or not bringing about , the social Europe , or the Europe of the people .
for us , that must remain the priority .
Mr President , this is a day of cel@@ e@@ bra@@ tion for Europe and for the European Parliament .
it has taken over 20 years to construc@@ t this Constitution but we are getting close .
I will vote for this report and for the Constitution for three simple reasons .
firstly , this Constitution was prepared in an open and democratic way .
I have been a civil ser@@ v@@ ant for ten years and I have been involved in negotiating three inter@@ governmental con@@ fer@@ ences , including the Amster@@ dam Treaty , the Nice Treaty and this one .
I can guarantee that had this been an inter@@ governmental conference from beginning to end , we would never have had this Constitution .
but because we had a Convention , we most certainly got one .
secondly , this Constitution is a good thing .
there are 4@@ 48 reasons for it , all of which are in the Treaty as ar@@ tic@@ les .
there are three key issues : firstly , it makes the European Union more democratic ; secondly , it makes it more effective and , thirdly , it makes it more under@@ stand@@ able .
thirdly , I will vote for this report because it is very good .
I urge anyone who has not read it from beginning to end to have a look at it , because it simp@@ lif@@ ies and clari@@ f@@ ies the Treaty in a ma@@ g@@ nific@@ ent way .
I wish to congratulate Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , who are both at present speaking on their mo@@ b@@ ile p@@ hon@@ es - I hope they are N@@ o@@ ki@@ as ! - on their excellent report .
if I were to bring up just one thing from the Treaty , it would be on external relations .
just reflec@@ ting on what happened in Asia , we had had a presid@@ ent , a foreign minis@@ ter , a common security policy , a defence system , a better crisis management system , then together we would have got much further .
finally , I would urge each and every Member to go home and defend this Treaty .
that is most certainly what I will do .
Mr President , Commissioner Wall@@ strö@@ m , hon@@ ou@@ red gu@@ es@@ ts in the g@@ all@@ er@@ y , ladies and gentlemen . today &apos;s debate is in my view the most important debate not only of this session but in the history of the Union as a whole .
the Constitutional Treaty is a historic mil@@ es@@ t@@ one and a particularly em@@ an@@ ci@@ p@@ ating moment for the European Community .
the very fact that , in this plenary session , there are representatives of twenty @-@ five nation @-@ states holding discussions in their own languages is clear pro@@ of of an ability to co@@ exist in equality and to respect common values .
on 1 May of last year , you welcomed us , or the great majority of us , here together , and we , or the great majority of us , felt sinc@@ er@@ ely hon@@ ou@@ red .
today , we are all decid@@ ing together on the adoption of a common primary uni@@ fied legal framework respec@@ ting just those values which have allowed us to en@@ large your ass@@ embly .
I respect the fact that you wa@@ ited for us and I personally feel hon@@ ou@@ red that I am able to c@@ ast my vote , because I perc@@ eive the Constitutional Treaty as an eth@@ ical and mor@@ al framework for Europeans , reinfor@@ cing our common histor@@ ical id@@ entity , but I also respect the position of individual nation @-@ states and the pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tis@@ m of their citizens .
what more important document could we give our citizens ?
indeed , through the Constitution we are also strengthening their influence on political decision @-@ making and making it possible for them to exer@@ t closer control .
I have lis@@ tened carefully to the reser@@ vations of the op@@ pon@@ ents and I should like to say most sinc@@ er@@ ely that the Constitution is a compromise , but the adoption of compromis@@ es is a great fe@@ a@@ ture of all sensible , responsible and toler@@ ant people .
the European Constitutional Treaty op@@ ens up new hor@@ iz@@ ons for us and also signific@@ antly em@@ an@@ ci@@ pa@@ tes the European Union within the framework of international politics .
I believe that , by voting for the Constitutional Treaty , we are sen@@ ding a clear and positive signal not only to the citizens of the nation @-@ states within Europe , but also to the whole world , a signal of our resolve to live together in peace and solidarity .
- I@@ n this Parliament I represent citizens of a state , which has already rati@@ fied the European Union Constitution .
on 11 November last year , bar@@ ely two weeks after its sig@@ ning in R@@ ome , Li@@ thu@@ ania rati@@ fied this document , the first European Union Member State to do so .
it is true , the decision was made not in a citizens &apos; referendum , but in one of the last sit@@ t@@ ings of Parliament before the end of its term .
it is also true that the European Union Constitution was rati@@ fied in Li@@ thu@@ ania without comprehensive discussions on the provisions of this document , which ought to be known by , or at least fam@@ ili@@ ar to Li@@ thu@@ ania &apos;s citizens , above all so that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities offer@@ ed by the European Union Constitution .
why do I believe that it is necessary to vote for the ratification of this Constitution in the European Parliament ?
firstly . yes , until 200@@ 9 we can live according to the Treaty of Nice , but it has been clear for a while that the enlarged European Union cannot work effectively without necessary institutional changes , without a new and effective div@@ ision of func@@ tion responsibilities amongst the institutions of the European Union , as well as amongst the European Union and Member States , amongst the European Parliament and national parliaments .
the European Union cannot work well without an effective mechanism for the en@@ ac@@ tment of resolutions , without more active participation by citizens , and without clear and transparent accoun@@ tability to citizens .
this is as obvious as what is written in the mo@@ t@@ to of the report by Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t - a gro@@ wn man cannot we@@ ar children &apos;s c@@ lo@@ th@@ es which he gre@@ w out of long ago .
secondly . the European Union is s@@ tri@@ ving to become one of the most competitive regions with the most dyna@@ mic development in the world .
I believe that while s@@ tri@@ ving for this goal it is important not only to properly set out the priorities of European Union ex@@ pan@@ sion and to ensure that these receive the necessary funding , but also to see that there is order in the European Union above all from the stand@@ point of its institutions .
I am about to fin@@ ish , Mr President .
I would also like a provision about the Christian ro@@ ots of the European Union to be included in the pre@@ am@@ ble of the European Union Constitution .
despite the fact that there is no such provision , I will vote for the ratification of this document which is im@@ perfec@@ t , but suffici@@ ently good .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , the European Constitutional Treaty is another important step in the development of European integration .
it cre@@ ates the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ isi@@ tes for the European Union , following enlargement , to be able to act as a decisive factor in European development , and , of course , for it also to be able effectively to influence developments in the world .
I see the benefit of the European Constitutional Treaty as being , among other things , that it brings the EU closer to its citizens , exten@@ ds the rights of EU citizens , en@@ sh@@ rin@@ es the Charter of Fundamental Rights in primary law , simp@@ lif@@ ies the legal system and re@@ places the main European Treaties currently in force with a single text .
the Constitution also reinfor@@ ces the democratic nature of the Union and strength@@ ens the role of the European Parliament and that of parliaments in the Member States .
it cre@@ ates the conditions for effective decision @-@ making by the European Union , and also clari@@ f@@ ies the powers of the European Union with respect to the Member States .
in addition , it strength@@ ens the EU &apos;s ability to act as a cohes@@ i@@ ve and uni@@ fied power in the international community , which is very important in the light of the events in South @-@ East Asia .
for all these and many other reasons , which are too numerous to mention here , social democra@@ cies , including the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h social democracy which I represent here , une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally support the draft Constitutional Treaty .
as regards my home country , the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h Republic , the situation with respect to ratification of the European Constitution is not going to be simple .
the European Constitution is opposed not only by the commun@@ ists , but also by the con@@ serva@@ tive right , represented here in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
I should therefore like to inv@@ ite Mr Poettering and the other leaders of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , for example Mr Kar@@ as , whom I can see in the Chamber , to come to the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h Republic and urge the pr@@ o @-@ European C@@ z@@ ec@@ h forces to rati@@ fy the European Constitution .
the C@@ i@@ vi@@ c Democ@@ ratic Party , which you have accepted into your ran@@ ks , will not do this work for you .
I thank you .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the real world in which we live is far from being a fair world and changes are therefore required to traditional political mo@@ del@@ s .
what is new and fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating in the European Constitution is the connection between the recognition of a common system of values , democratic values and human rights , and the recognition of a common system of authority .
this no@@ table connection between a project of justice and a method of political shar@@ ing is exactly how the great ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ her I@@ m@@ man@@ u@@ el K@@ ant en@@ vis@@ aged it .
the European Constitution is therefore an act of both political trans@@ for@@ mation and mor@@ al trans@@ for@@ mation .
I am sen@@ ding a letter today to the President of Parliament and to you , Commissioner for institutional relations , sugges@@ ting that we set up a T@@ V sta@@ tion constantly broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting the work of Parliament and the Council &apos;s future public works to all EU countries .
lastly , I wish to pay tribu@@ te to the rapporteurs , Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t .
Mr President , the decisions made by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit have proved to be of still greater signific@@ ance than anyone had for@@ eseen at that time .
the whole of today &apos;s debate has shown this quite clearly .
what was it that dro@@ ve the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken Summit ?
it was , in reality , two things .
firstly , they wanted an EU that func@@ tioned more effici@@ ently and , secondly , they wanted an EU that could ensure that we too could operate once enlargement had become a reality .
wh@@ en@@ ever we have al@@ tered the methods of European cooperation , this has nor@@ m@@ ally happened as a se@@ al@@ ed @-@ off process behind closed do@@ ors , following which the population of Europe has w@@ o@@ ken up one morning to find that leading politicians have once more changed the conditions of cooperation .
that was not , however , the way in which matters proceed@@ ed this time .
a Convention was set up , in which I myself had the ple@@ asure of particip@@ ating .
I think the Convention did some exc@@ iting work , but it also set a new objective for how we are to effect changes in Europe in the future .
in future , changes are to be made as part of an open process .
we are now , therefore , presented with a new draft Constitutional Treaty which we need to discuss with the people .
that being said , the following are crucial points I should like to emphasise .
firstly , an integra@@ l fe@@ a@@ ture of the new Constitutional Treaty is that it provides us with values concerning not merely democracy and human rights , but also the environment and social responsibility .
secondly , the new Constitutional Treaty provides us with an as@@ surance that the principles of op@@ enn@@ ess and democracy , which a modern @-@ day form of cooperation can be expected to respect , are also applied in European cooperation .
as a Member of the Council of Ministers , I have often won@@ der@@ ed at the fact that the population of Europe was not to know how I voted as a minis@@ ter when we reached the point of taking decisions .
now , we are acqu@@ ir@@ ing a modern , and open , Constitutional Treaty .
finally , we are ensuring that , via the European Parliament , the elected representatives of the people are given greater influence .
all in all , it is a good product that we have deb@@ ated today and that we are to recommen@@ d to the population of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the challenge that Europe must face over the coming months is vital for European integration .
citizens and members of parliaments all across the continent are being called on to adopt a single fundamental Charter which sanctions and strength@@ ens the values upon which this Union is foun@@ ded : peace , prosperity , democracy , justice , freedom and solidarity .
the new Constitutional Treaty is certainly not everything we had hop@@ ed it would be , but its very existence constitu@@ tes an un@@ preced@@ ented political and histor@@ ical event , which was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ va@@ ble until a few years ago .
the text we are to adopt strength@@ ens the democratic legitim@@ acy of the European In@@ stitu@@ tions and brings them closer to the 4@@ 50 million men and women who bel@@ ong to the Union .
indeed , the Constitution conf@@ ers greater powers on national parliaments and on the European Parliament , in both legislative and political terms : our citizens will also have a greater say in the democratic process thanks to the closer b@@ ond between Community institutions and local communities , the social partners and associ@@ ations .
our duty , as elected representatives , is to make this participation real , productive and tan@@ gible .
Europe will thereby consolid@@ ate its role as a global pla@@ yer .
this is the main challenge : it is our duty and responsibility to build a Union which can speak with one voice on international issues .
lastly , cultural id@@ entity : despite our regret that there is no reference to the Christian ro@@ ots upon which our Union is un@@ den@@ i@@ ably foun@@ ded , we , as representatives of the Union of Christian Democrats , str@@ en@@ u@@ ously support ratification of this text .
the Italian Parliament will rati@@ fy the Treaty in the coming weeks ; it will be a positive vote , a vote of encoura@@ g@@ ement for other countries where the value of Europe is not felt as deep@@ ly as it is in Italy .
our country , our government , our party - preser@@ ving the leg@@ acy of those men who left their mark on and foun@@ ded Europe - will contribute towards a positive outcome of the ratification process , in order to give full effect to the ide@@ als in which we Christian Democrats have always believ@@ ed .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratula@@ ting the rapporteurs on this report , which ad@@ ds clar@@ ity and w@@ eight to the debate .
I was one of the 200 parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans who partici@@ pa@@ ted in the Convention and produced the Convention text , which the I@@ G@@ C subsequ@@ ently took on board to a very large degree .
I doubt whether any Member State constitution has ever been prepared in such an open and democratic way .
I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved .
of the 200 parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans particip@@ ating in that Convention , only eight signed an alternative text , basi@@ cally argu@@ ing for the dis@@ integration of Europe .
we have heard that case being put here this morning , with Mr A@@ ll@@ is@@ ter of Nor@@ thern Ireland argu@@ ing for a re@@ ver@@ sion to 19@@ th century absolu@@ te soverei@@ gn@@ ty .
if S@@ in@@ n F@@ é@@ in had partici@@ pa@@ ted in the debate this morning they would - although they are the direct political op@@ po@@ si@@ tes in Nor@@ thern Ireland - have been making exactly the same case .
perhaps it is a kind of progress that they agree on 19@@ th century absolu@@ te soverei@@ gn@@ ty , although it is unfor@@ tun@@ ate that they continue to fall out over the outcome of the B@@ attle of the Bo@@ y@@ ne in 16@@ 90 !
the fact is that this is a world in which the response to natural disas@@ ters and to man @-@ made problems clearly requires trans@@ national governance .
uni@@ qu@@ ely in the world , Europe is developing a democratic form of trans@@ national governance .
this Constitution will give us more democracy , more rights and more potential for a prosper@@ ous society in Europe , and indeed for solidarity with the rest of the world .
to conclude , those out@@ comes will not happen of their own accor@@ d .
we have to work for them , using this Constitution as the basis for our work .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , 2004 was a particularly no@@ te@@ wor@@ thy year in the history of European integration , and it had both high and low points .
there can be no doubt that the high points included the enlargement of the Community from 15 to 25 Member States , and the indic@@ ations given in December 2004 that further enlarg@@ ements would follow .
another high point was the sig@@ ning of the Constitution on 29 October in R@@ ome .
it is generally acknowled@@ ged , however , that the European elections were a low point , both in terms of their date and their outcome .
tur@@ n@@ out for the European elections was lower than ever before , and further evidence for this can be seen in the fra@@ g@@ men@@ tation the results caused in this House .
pro@@ of of this fra@@ g@@ men@@ tation can be found not least in the many c@@ ol@@ our@@ ful fla@@ gs I see around me , and by no means only in fron@@ t of the building .
in 2005 , therefore , we must ensure that the public become involved again in the European project , and I do not believe that to be actually such a hard task .
it is , however , an issue of communication .
the product we have - the new European Constitution - is a very good one , and we must w@@ in people over to it .
we do not need pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da campa@@ ig@@ ns ; instead , we need reli@@ able information , in particular with regard to claim@@ s that the Constitution will benefit people .
we should not promis@@ e people the mo@@ on , but tell them what benefits the Constitution will and can bring .
Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t have sum@@ mar@@ ised this in four key points .
the Constitution will bring greater clar@@ ity and greater effectiveness to the European Union , as well as more democracy and accoun@@ tability and more rights for citizens by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
providing information is not the same thing as re@@ fra@@ ining from criticism , but the first task for such criticism must be to make it clear that our product is , in principle , a good one .
finally , it has repe@@ a@@ tedly been claim@@ ed that the public is not interested in a Constitution .
when we held a pub@@ lic@@ ity event at the Uni@@ versity of G@@ ra@@ z , however , the Constitution met with more interest than to@@ ad@@ sto@@ ols or dre@@ am interpre@@ tation .
this should be an inc@@ en@@ tive for us to promote the Constitution to the public .
Mr President , I would like to dec@@ l@@ are that the Italian soci@@ alist delegation will be voting for the Cor@@ bet@@ t @-@ M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o draft report , and I would extend my congratula@@ tions to the rapporteurs on the quality of the report , in particular the explan@@ atory statement .
today the European Parliament has certainly reached an historic mil@@ es@@ t@@ one , which brings to mind 14 February 198@@ 4 when Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i &apos;s draft Treaty , of which the Constitution is in some ways the ide@@ al contin@@ uation , was adopted .
it matters little if in stric@@ tly legal terms the text is a treaty , but what does matter is the substance : today we are all prepared to call it the Constitution , a term which until just a few years ago was often considered un@@ men@@ tion@@ able .
those like Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i and the F@@ eder@@ alist Mo@@ vement , to which I am hon@@ ou@@ red to bel@@ ong , who believ@@ ed and still believe that it is vital to create a true feder@@ al state with few but essential competences that will ensure a role for the European Union in the world , would have wis@@ hed for a b@@ ol@@ der text .
nevertheless , this Constitution contains in ess@@ ence certain fundamental pas@@ sa@@ ges which constitute a stable , las@@ ting framework , on the basis of which we must now move forward so that the Union can effectively do what its citizens expect .
I will only quo@@ te a few examples which I consider to be a priority and which in certain cases ar@@ ise from the link with my region , a cross @-@ border region .
firstly , I would like to mention the establishment of the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs , who is the European Union &apos;s voice on the international stage and who guid@@ es its foreign policy .
the procedures which make him , as a member of the Commission , accoun@@ table to Parliament are a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for the existence of a foreign policy .
following the many - too many - conflicts which have character@@ ised recent years , the citizens of Europe are asking us and themselves what Europe is doing .
secondly , the EU must be a model of development , a tan@@ gible te@@ sta@@ ment to the fact that it is possible to comb@@ ine development and solidarity .
lastly , I would like to point out that the principle of subsidiarity is now a constitutional principle and this strength@@ ens and guarantees it .
that is another reason why I believe we must vote for this report .
I support this constitution , however , in my opinion , it is a good thing that in this Parliament we have Members that are against it .
let me say why this is so .
not because I agree with the arguments that they are putting forward , on the contrary I think that many of their arguments are based on mis@@ taken , or even fal@@ se pre@@ mis@@ es .
but because without anyone oppos@@ ing it , we will end up having a mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous debate where everyone would be in favour and where we would have a lack of objective analysis .
there is no better way by which one can w@@ in an argument about Europe as when one has the courage to compar@@ e the arguments in favour with those against .
we have to take seriously the arguments of wh@@ o@@ ever is against and tre@@ at them with respect .
but we should not be af@@ ra@@ id or run away from the arguments of wh@@ o@@ ever is against , let alone ignor@@ e them .
we should not expect to w@@ in the argument if we do not ex@@ pose ourselves to an open debate , otherwise we will end up saying that we have w@@ on the ga@@ me when in fact only one te@@ am would have come to play .
after all , when one compar@@ es the arguments in favour of this constitution with the arguments against , one will not take long to conclude that the constitution has much more that is good in it than bad and it mer@@ its the support of the European citizens .
there is no doubt that if we explain to the people what the constitution means , the people will be more in favour than against it , because they understand how log@@ ical is the uni@@ fication of Europe , that it makes sense and that it is in their interest .
therefore it is of ut@@ most importance that wh@@ o@@ ever is in this room , wh@@ o@@ ever in this Parliament is in favour of this constitution , has to com@@ mit himself or her@@ self directly with the people to see that they understand it and support it .
this support will be based on the compar@@ is@@ on of the arguments and therefore it will be on a more open , more balanced and a more democratic debate .
Mr President , a Constitution for Europe is necessary : it is a democratic requirement .
prof@@ oun@@ dly atta@@ ched to the un@@ ity of the party , the French Socialists will conduct the national debate without in any way giving up our prog@@ res@@ sive values and ideas .
I consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing Parliament &apos;s authority in respect of the Constitutional Treaty , but I am sor@@ ry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected .
nonetheless , we shall be part of this long and tre@@ ac@@ her@@ ous process that is the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty .
we state that this Constitutional Treaty is stable but capable of being modi@@ fied .
that is the case with all constitu@@ tions , and with this Treaty no less than with others .
we also regret the fact that a large majority of the opinions issu@@ ed by other parliamentary committees that have identi@@ fied a h@@ ost of short@@ com@@ ings in the Constitutional Treaty have been left out of this report .
we are also keen to state clearly that a special uni@@ t , established under the Dutch Presidency , will continue with its work under the future Presid@@ encies and will carefully scru@@ tin@@ ise all the possible consequences of the Constitution &apos;s being rejected .
I want Parliament , legitim@@ ised in its role following this vote , to get to g@@ ri@@ ps with the difficulties of implementing the Constitutional Treaty and to use its parliamentary right of initiative .
that is what we are called upon to do , and it is what Amendment No 17 is all about .
yes , it is inc@@ u@@ mb@@ ent upon ourselves as MEPs and elected representatives of the European people to take a pro@@ active role in implementing the Constitutional Treaty , which govern@@ s the cor@@ por@@ ate life of more than 4@@ 50 million Europeans .
the difficulties re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed by the opinions of the other committees will res@@ ur@@ face so@@ on@@ er or later .
we must therefore be prepared to correct the im@@ perfec@@ tions be@@ qu@@ e@@ a@@ th@@ ed by the Intergovernmental Conference when it al@@ tered the del@@ icate balance achieved w@@ isely and equ@@ ita@@ bly by the Convention .
let us prepare ourselves , ladies and gentlemen , for a new round .
it is , indeed , going to be necessary to defend our pop@@ ular legitim@@ acy in respect of the Constitutional Treaty , whose short@@ com@@ ings we have an absolu@@ te duty to correct when the time is right .
a number of my colleagues in the French delegation will ab@@ sta@@ in from voting on this report .
Mr President , this Constitutional Treaty is worth up@@ holding .
as a Christian Democ@@ rat , I am pleased that the subsidiarity principle has just been further worked out , deep@@ ened and an@@ cho@@ red .
the European Union has now also recognised and en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed the task of the regional dimension , namely local and regional authorities .
there is a need for a better balance to be struc@@ k between what happens at the centre and away from it , in Brussels , in the nation states and in regions and mun@@ ic@@ i@@ pal@@ ities .
as a govern@@ or at regional level , I no@@ tic@@ ed for years that EU information remain@@ ed at Council level for too long and that regions and to@@ w@@ ns were involved in the debate and decision @-@ making too late .
as a representative of the European organisations , I was also able to atten@@ d hear@@ ings of the Convention , particularly those about subsidiarity .
the Treaty text reinfor@@ ces the position of regions and to@@ w@@ ns , which are close to the citizens and where important tasks are carried out in many areas .
in that way , the democratic lo@@ op@@ h@@ ole , which Mr Prodi mentioned in his report on good governance , is closed once more .
it is an important step that the European Parliament supports this and remains critical about the way in which this Treaty will be f@@ l@@ es@@ hed out at local or regional level in the next few years .
I would also suggest that we in this House from time to time ask the Council and the Committee of the Regi@@ ons whether , among other things , our national states have now lear@@ ned to commun@@ icate open@@ ly about European policy , and whether , in the subsidiarity test , national parliaments take the opinions of regions and to@@ w@@ ns into consideration .
I know that the Committee of the Regi@@ ons is developing a similar test .
in short , this Treaty is well worth up@@ holding .
consequently , we will labour for this cause at national level , certainly if referendu@@ ms are on the agenda .
- Mr President , the major risks from this Constitution are three in number .
the first is , are we to become a feder@@ ation , a feder@@ ation both on foreign affairs and in defence and elsewhere , or are we to be a Europe of a lo@@ ose feder@@ ation of dis@@ similar partners , especially after enlargement ?
the second is , are we to be a Europe of social awareness or are we to be a Europe of the open , un@@ contro@@ lled market ?
the third is , are we to be a Europe without a democratic defic@@ it , with power in the hands of the citizens , or are we to be a Europe in which European elections are held and we have abs@@ ten@@ tions of 70 , 60 or 50 % ?
in my opinion , this Constitution answ@@ ers all these questions most pos@@ iti@@ vely , in all events much more pos@@ iti@@ vely than they are addressed under current tre@@ aties .
anyone against this Constitution , alle@@ g@@ ed@@ ly for reasons of social sens@@ iti@@ vity , needs to answer the question of whether the existing tre@@ aties help the poor and the wea@@ k in Europe more than this Constitution help@@ s them .
allow me an element of min@@ or national pr@@ ide as a Greek and as a soci@@ alist : it was during the Greek Presidency , in June 2003 , that the initial negotiations on this Constitution were concluded , and I am pro@@ ud of that .
of course , it now remains to be applied and this is where the MEPs and the governments have a huge responsibility .
we need to ensure that the se@@ ed@@ s of social awareness so@@ wn in the Constitution do not remain pre@@ tty words and are put into practice .
the fam@@ ous social ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am@@ ing clause setting out the Union &apos;s obligation to ensure that its every policy promo@@ tes the objectives of high employment , environmental protection , public health , education and equality between men and women can only be applied under good laws .
si@@ mil@@ arly , I must tell you that , for any MEPs s@@ tri@@ ving for a soci@@ ally fa@@ ire@@ r Europe , this is a particularly pa@@ ins@@ taking and particularly welcome challenge .
for many people , the institutions in Brussels seem remo@@ te .
they see them as c@@ ent@@ res of power where decisions are made over which they have no influence .
the Constitutional Treaty is not a mi@@ rac@@ le c@@ ure for all the problems of the European Union , but it is an opportunity to reduce democratic short@@ com@@ ings and to speed up Europe &apos;s development .
why ?
because it re@@ places numerous agreements and amendments , thereby reducing the lack of transparency in key European Union documents ; because in a single document it brings together the key constitutional and legal foun@@ dations and policies of the European Union ; because it is the basis for more effective functioning of European institutions ; because it contribu@@ tes to the implementation of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy ; because it remo@@ ves the problems that would ar@@ ise were the current agreements to continue to be used in the future .
the Constitutional Treaty is a compromise that does not completely satis@@ fy anyone , but it nonetheless most represents what we have been able to achieve in the convention .
we need the Constitutional Treaty because without it we cannot expect any effective reforms or effective functioning in the enlarged Europe .
although the c@@ hap@@ ter on policies has frequ@@ ently been critic@@ ised , as a sha@@ dow rapporteur I must express my satisfac@@ tion that in the area of social policy and employment very concrete commitments have been set out for the Commission and the governments of the Member States , including the establishment of a Committee for Social Pro@@ te@@ ction and European Social Har@@ mon@@ y .
by accep@@ ting the report on the Constitutional Treaty , the European Parliament is sen@@ ding a clear signal to the people of Europe that the time has come for a transparent and wh@@ oles@@ ale re@@ arrang@@ ement of our constitutional and legal foun@@ dations , thereby ensuring that Europe becomes a continent of peace , prosperity , solidarity and security .
finally I should mention that the Slo@@ ven@@ ian parliament will rati@@ fy the Constitutional Treaty this month .
I am convinced that it will do so by a large majority .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I reject tota@@ li@@ ta@@ rian reg@@ imes .
my gran@@ d@@ mo@@ ther &apos;s family di@@ ed in the Na@@ z@@ i gas cha@@ mb@@ ers . my fa@@ ther was inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated by the commun@@ ist regime .
we have paid in blood for our commitment to the freedom of con@@ sci@@ ence , which was emb@@ o@@ di@@ ed for us by Europe as a hope for democracy , freedom of thought , religious freedom and freedom of con@@ sci@@ ence .
I believe that n@@ one of you would consider me to be anti @-@ European if I were to pose a few questions .
why is the European Parliament pr@@ on@@ oun@@ cing on the Constitutional Treaty before the citizens of the individual states ?
do we need Europe to be govern@@ ed by a constitution ?
the soverei@@ gn@@ ty of Member States should not be threa@@ tened .
if , however , the Constitution strength@@ ens the role of Parliament , but does not define the competences of the European Court of Justice , will the balance between institutions thus be up@@ set ?
decisions of the Court will be directly imposed on Union bodies and Member States without any right of appeal .
the European Court of Justice will be free from any criticism .
can we pre@@ ten@@ d that this will not happen ?
the draft Constitution contains no guarantees that the European Court of Justice will not appropriate some of the exclu@@ sive competences of the soverei@@ g@@ n states , even contrary to national constitu@@ tions .
even if the majority in this Parliament changes after the elections and the com@@ position of the Council changes , a double unanim@@ ity will be required in order to change policies .
and I just wonder : will such a Union be capable of development if its direction is set by this Constitution ?
our civil@@ isation has developed from Christian ro@@ ots .
if the Constitution fail@@ s to acknowledge this histor@@ ical fact , un@@ rest will be introduced into the life of society .
a new ide@@ ology will rise up under a m@@ ask of toler@@ ance .
are we to build the European home on a distor@@ tion of history ?
is it true that , without this Constitution , the concept of a united Europe will di@@ e ?
I think not .
my vo@@ ters have put their fa@@ it@@ h in me and I wish to proceed in Europe so that everyone , including the small@@ est , wea@@ kes@@ t and poor@@ est , are accepted into it and can find their places in it .
ladies and gentlemen , in a democratic Europe , I ask that we respect the freedom of con@@ sci@@ ence when voting .
Mr President , despite all the differences of opinion which the debate sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding this issue has produced , we are once again making European history .
as such , this Treaty is an important step in the right direction .
I am certain that the foun@@ ders of the movement for European integration would be pro@@ ud and pleased if they were now wit@@ n@@ essing just how many fundamental issues have resul@@ ted in such compromis@@ es that Parliament is now deb@@ ating and voting on them .
it is unfor@@ tun@@ ate that in some countries the debate on the Treaty has been taken out of context and used to fu@@ el an internal and party political row .
the wor@@ st fe@@ a@@ tures of Europe@@ an@@ isation , in@@ toler@@ ance and j@@ in@@ go@@ ism , are all too often visi@@ ble and au@@ di@@ ble at such times , although attemp@@ ts are made to conc@@ e@@ al them in the form of lies dis@@ gu@@ ised as lo@@ f@@ ti@@ er as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
when this Treaty has come into force , there is no chance that it will lead to the creation of a European super@@ state : on the contrary , its spirit and text will effectively blo@@ ck any self @-@ seeking as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions on the part of states , groups of states or extre@@ mis@@ t mo@@ v@@ ements .
the Treaty will still allow the economy to play the role best su@@ ited to it in cooperation within the continent .
the dyna@@ m@@ ics of mutual economic activity and the single monetary policy are also pre@@ conditions of political cooperation .
without democracy there is no social dimension , and there is no democracy without a market economy .
I am also pro@@ ud that in my own country , Fin@@ land , we have been able to agree that Parliament can decide on the ratification of the Treaty at national level .
while ap@@ prov@@ ing the report submitted , I would like to reiterate once more that Li@@ thu@@ ania , on the decision of its Parliament , was the first to rati@@ fy this Constitution .
after the recent elections , Li@@ thu@@ ania &apos;s social democ@@ rats , who were and remain in power , took an active part in the task of preparing the Constitutional Treaty .
when countries were invi@@ ted to set down in legal terms the things which after deliber@@ ation all generally agreed on , we did this without delay .
we had good grounds for this .
in a referendum held a year and a half ago , Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ians gave the cle@@ ar@@ est &apos; Y@@ es &quot; to European Union membership of all the new Members .
support in Li@@ thu@@ ania for European Union membership continues to gro@@ w and has reached 8@@ 2 % .
people see that the hop@@ es associated with the European Union are being fulfi@@ lled , and so they want to strengthen it .
the failure of a referendum on the Constitution in any country of the European Union would , I believe , be a pain@@ ful b@@ low to the hop@@ es of the majority of Europeans , among them Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ians .
today the European Union ship already contains 25 states , but is sa@@ il@@ ing with far too wea@@ k an eng@@ ine for such a car@@ go - the Treaty of Nice .
if it is not re@@ placed with a much more power@@ ful one - the eng@@ ine of the Constitutional Treaty - our common ship will reduce speed and may begin to dri@@ ft .
with the old Nice eng@@ ine we will never achieve the goals defined in the Lisbon strategy , and we will be unable to implement new neigh@@ bour policies effectively .
this is particularly relevant to the new European Union countries .
a strong democratic European Union moving forward - this is essential , not just in the interest of our country .
the Constitutional Treaty - no matter how compl@@ icated a compromise it might be - contribu@@ tes to this .
Li@@ thu@@ ania rati@@ fied it with resolve , so that the energy and optimis@@ m of the new countries might be passed on to the European Union &apos;s old @-@ ti@@ m@@ ers .
thank you .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that this substantial report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o has been tabled .
as a former sub@@ stitu@@ te member of the Convention , I must ad@@ mit that I might recommen@@ d to some people that they read this report rather than the Constitution itself , as it is su@@ pre@@ mely read@@ able and extremely convinc@@ ing on the issue .
today I should like to address my comments to those Members of this House who have taken a critical approach to the Constitution .
they have war@@ ned against the creation of a European super@@ state and den@@ oun@@ ced short@@ com@@ ings , and they have come out in opposition to mis@@ takes made in the past .
I believe we should make it very clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of addres@@ sing these short@@ com@@ ings .
the European Constitution re@@ me@@ dies many of the problems that all of us have experienc@@ ed with Europe as it exists today .
it la@@ ys down a system of competences and grants national parliaments the right of participation , thus making Europe less cen@@ tr@@ alist and less bureauc@@ ratic .
the Constitution gives the European Parliament a full say , and Europe will therefore become more democratic than it has been to date .
it also strength@@ ens citizens &quot; rights , above all by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as citizens will be able to invo@@ ke the Constitution directly when appe@@ al@@ ing against European decisions .
finally , the Constitution provides this Europe of ours with a basis of values , and is thus a way of coun@@ tering the tech@@ no@@ c@@ ratic approach to political problems .
the Euro@@ sc@@ ep@@ tics should therefore really be in favour of this Constitution , as it is the only way of changing the things we all wish to change .
today is the an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the b@@ ir@@ th of A@@ le@@ x@@ an@@ der H@@ am@@ il@@ ton , one of the fa@@ th@@ ers of the American Constitution , whose pic@@ ture can today be found on ten @-@ doll@@ ar no@@ tes .
as I look at the fa@@ th@@ ers and mo@@ th@@ ers of the European Constitution in this House , I hope that they will also be re@@ memb@@ ered as gra@@ te@@ fully in 200 years &quot; time .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs on a very thorou@@ gh report .
this document sum@@ mar@@ ises excep@@ tion@@ ally well the most essential points of the European Constitution .
at the same time , I would like to see a sli@@ ghtly different emphasis regarding the pub@@ lic@@ ising of the Constitution .
in its conclusions , today &apos;s report concentra@@ tes on prin@@ ted materi@@ als about the Constitution .
however , public sur@@ ve@@ ys and common lo@@ gic tell us that European citizens primarily look for and receive information via television , including information about the EU .
today &apos;s report stres@@ ses the need to clearly dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish every point in the Constitutional Treaty that di@@ ff@@ ers from existing tre@@ aties .
this , however , is more a to@@ pic for ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic research rather than information to be rela@@ yed to every European citizen .
the 3@@ 00 @-@ pa@@ ge Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is v@@ olu@@ min@@ ous enough as it is , and consequently also more complex than the constitu@@ tions of the Member States .
there is no common European public opinion yet , but in my home country E@@ st@@ onia , for example , support for the EU has gro@@ wn with every month since E@@ st@@ onia &apos;s accession .
at the same time support is fall@@ ing in many Member States .
nevertheless , the same rule applies both in journ@@ alism and in public information throughout Europe : people must be given what they want .
in old and new Member States , in c@@ ities and in the country , people are primarily interested in what effect the European Constitution will have on their every@@ day life .
I believe that in pres@@ enting the Constitution , we should concentra@@ te on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
for instance , what does the right to good administration sti@@ pu@@ la@@ ted in the Charter mean for each citizen ?
to what extent will such a requirement force bureauc@@ rats or politicians to justi@@ fy their decisions , or to be open ?
answ@@ ers to questions such as these should be an integra@@ l part of public information about the Constitution .
also , in conclusion , I would say that there can be no talk of infor@@ ming the citizens of Europe if television is not included .
the Parliament &apos;s Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ General for In@@ for@@ mation should take this into account in its efforts to pub@@ lic@@ ise the Constitution .
I wish them and all the European television networks success in trans@@ la@@ ting the Constitution &apos;s complex wor@@ ding into a pal@@ a@@ table for@@ mat for the public .
thank you .
- Mr President , tomorrow &apos;s vote is of historic importance .
the significant progress being made with the European Constitution and the advantages which der@@ i@@ ve from its positive provisions have already been presented both in the full report by my honourable friends Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and today in this Chamber .
as , therefore , almost all the issues have been ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted , I shall con@@ fine myself to one vital problem .
a new mar@@ a@@ th@@ on star@@ ts from tomorrow for ratification by the Member States .
but what will happen if there is some problem with ratification by some Member State ?
the Constitution does not contain a specific provision to deal with this even@@ tu@@ ality .
nonetheless , the declar@@ ations relating to the provisions of the Constitution state that , if two years after sig@@ nature of the Constitution , 4 / 5 of the Member States have rati@@ fied the Constitution in question and one or more Member States are facing difficulties in connection with ratification , the matter will be submitted to the European Council .
do you , however , think that this arrang@@ ement is satisfactory ?
I believe that there should be a much cle@@ ar@@ er provision .
unfortunately , however , this arrang@@ ement also emer@@ ged from the series of compromis@@ es which were necessary in order for us to get where we are today .
therefore , it is not enough for us to talk and to support the ratification of the Constitution un@@ reser@@ ved@@ ly .
all the governments and all of us need to work to avoid such an unfor@@ tun@@ ate development if we want to enter a new er@@ a for our continent .
- Mr President , by adopting the report by Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ è@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , Parliament will be making its last major contribution towards the adoption of a constitutional Treaty for Europe .
the existence of such a Treaty will en@@ sh@@ r@@ ine the historic trans@@ ition from a Community of peoples and countries prog@@ res@@ sively united by ever @-@ closer economic ties to an actual political Community united by the desire for a common future .
fif@@ ty years of a policy of small , pr@@ ud@@ ent steps has pa@@ ved the way for a new reality based on shared values , civil@@ ised values that express a shared European id@@ entity based on peace , democracy , human rights and economic and social progress .
Europe is not being buil@@ t at vari@@ ance with the sec@@ ular reality of the nations on our continent .
Europe is foun@@ ded upon the free and informed desire to ensure that the past does not repeat itself and to provide its peoples with guarantees that they will remain mas@@ ters of their own des@@ tin@@ y in a future la@@ den with challenges .
the cha@@ m@@ pi@@ ons of soverei@@ gn@@ ty , who acc@@ use Europe of ero@@ ding national soverei@@ gn@@ ty and who see in this Constitution their ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are of a super@@ state coming true , are prof@@ oun@@ dly mis@@ taken in their analysis .
economic , financial and technolog@@ ical globalisation , the current or potential emerg@@ ence of new global , political and economic poten@@ ta@@ tes , have forced Europe to seek respon@@ ses at national level to defend , deep@@ en and export the human@@ ist project initi@@ ated in the last century by the post @-@ war social state under the rule of law .
in a world that is character@@ ised by un@@ certainty , dis@@ order and der@@ e@@ gulation , it is increasingly necessary for Europe to speak out and to play an active role , both for us and for those others who look to us to set an example and to take action on matters of major international importance .
the cha@@ m@@ pi@@ ons of soverei@@ gn@@ ty are not the only op@@ pon@@ ents of this Treaty .
others have lou@@ dly critic@@ ised it for not going far enough , for the fact that results have been me@@ ag@@ re or for its lack of amb@@ ition .
such people ref@@ use to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made , because they per@@ sis@@ t with the poin@@ t@@ less exercise of compar@@ ing the constitutional Treaty before us to the ide@@ alised ver@@ sions of their dre@@ am@@ s instead of compar@@ ing it to the current Treaties and the Nice process , in particular .
Mr President , while the European Parliament has no for@@ mal role in the ratification procedure , I am pleased that , as the elected representatives of 25 Member States of the European Union , we are having this debate today , at a point in time when the ratification procedure has just got under way at parliamentary level and is just about to get under way at referendum level .
on the day when head@@ s of state and government signed the Constitution in R@@ ome , I happened to be in B@@ rat@@ isla@@ va , Slova@@ kia , where I was pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged to participate in the opening of the House of Europe .
that was the first opening of a House of Europe in one of the new Member States .
it was followed by the opening in December of a House of Europe in P@@ ra@@ gue .
procedures for establishing H@@ ous@@ es of Europe in all Member States are under way .
the princi@@ p@@ al func@@ tion of these H@@ ous@@ es of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens .
they offer citizens a point of information that is cen@@ tr@@ ally and visi@@ bly loc@@ ated in their own Member State .
the concept off@@ ers education on the European Union and , by providing ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ation for the political groups , it en@@ su@@ res that the views of this Parliament can be con@@ ve@@ yed to the citizens .
it is my beli@@ ef that if the European Union is to work , we have to strengthen and deep@@ en the relation@@ ships between this Parliament and the national parliaments .
there is no other way in which we can achieve that cooperation in the longer term .
it should not be an &apos; us and them &apos; situation ; it should be about everyone working together for the bet@@ ter@@ ment of all people in the 25 Member States - or perhaps the 27 Member States , should that come about .
that is the challenge for the future ; that is the challenge that we , as democ@@ rats , have to take on board .
it takes two sides to make a debate .
because people do not necess@@ arily agree with every word that others say , this does not mean that they have no right to say it .
I believe in the rights of everyone , I believe in democracy .
I believe that those who dis@@ agree with me have a right to their views .
the majority will ultimately w@@ in , but those who dis@@ agree can make this a better debate , and they should be encoura@@ ged to do so and should not be dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ised from their position .
Mr President , as this report demonstra@@ tes very well , there are three basic aspects to the draft Constitution : firstly , the Union &apos;s values and objectives , the un@@ ity and equality of its peoples , as well as the protection of the diversity of its cul@@ tures , id@@ ent@@ ities and languages ; secondly , the rights , interests and du@@ ties of the citizens ; and , thirdly , the rules for the institutions and for European political life .
the first two aspects - values and rights - define the European democracy we want , based on the diversity and freedom of the peoples , their progress and equality .
the third aspect - this should be made clear : the rules of play - is the result of compromis@@ es between L@@ ef@@ t and Ri@@ ght , between feder@@ alists and inter@@ govern@@ menta@@ lis@@ ts ; it should be made clear that it ref@@ ers to those rules , not to the policies to be implemented .
in this respect , the Constitution is not a final des@@ tin@@ ation , but a de@@ par@@ ture point , with a view to over@@ coming Europe &apos;s soci@@ o @-@ economic le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , its lack of capacity for innovation , research and development and its in@@ sufficient w@@ eight on the international stage .
we must move forward towards a European Government , moving beyond the currently pre@@ domin@@ ant method of inter@@ governmental coordination with all its im@@ po@@ tence , as demonstrated by the failure to implement the Lisbon strategy and the div@@ isions over the in@@ va@@ sion of Iraq .
with this view towards future progress , we shall call for a vote in favour of the European Constitution .
Mr President , a long @-@ standing dre@@ am of this Parliament , and one shared by many of Europe &apos;s citizens , is becoming reality .
we have worked long and hard for this Constitution , but we can be pro@@ ud of what has now been achieved , and I should like to take this opportunity today to thank Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t .
as sha@@ dow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Agriculture , I can say that we are in favour of this draft Constitution , which un@@ doub@@ tedly represents a gain for the committee .
when the common agricultural policy was established in 19@@ 5@@ 8 , this House was merely a consul@@ ta@@ tive body , and it was only with the Treaty of Amster@@ dam that we were given the right of codecision in the fields of the environment , consumer protection and food safety .
the democracy defic@@ it , having per@@ sis@@ ted in s@@ pite of everything , will now be overcome by means of an extension of the codecision procedure to include all decisions of principle on agricultural policy .
there are however also negative sides to the Constitution .
in future the Council will be able to take autonom@@ ous decisions on the setting of quo@@ ta@@ s , prices and qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive restrictions , as the draft Constitution takes no account of the new goals of the common agricultural policy following the EU agricultural reform .
this is a step back@@ wards from the current situation , and it will mean much work for us in the future .
as a representative of the German F@@ eder@@ al of B@@ ad@@ en @-@ W@@ ü@@ r@@ tte@@ mb@@ er@@ g , too , I believe that a number of extremely important goals have been achieved ; the national constitu@@ tions have been strength@@ ened , regions and local authorities have been accor@@ ded greater signific@@ ance , and the principle of subsidiarity has been ad@@ her@@ ed to .
the draft Constitution la@@ ys the foun@@ dations for common economic activities , and we will gain a common basis of values shared by all of us , something I see as particularly important .
we have before us a document which places an obligation on all those who bear responsibility for Europe .
Mr President , I am very much in favour of the European Constitution , and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their out@@ standing report .
the Constitution , which above all strength@@ ens the area of freedom , security and justice , mar@@ ks a mil@@ es@@ t@@ one on the road to a more secure and just Europe .
we have taken a gi@@ ant step towards a Europe of citizens with this Constitution , as by en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ing in it the Charter of Fundamental Rights , by EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and by simp@@ li@@ fied access to justice , citizens &quot; rights have been given an enormous bo@@ ost .
in addition , we now have increased opportunities to coordin@@ ate our efforts in the fight against such ev@@ ils as crime , rac@@ ism and x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in Europe .
I welcome the fact that the members of the C@@ S@@ U in this House will vote in favour of this report .
unfortunately , many members of the C@@ S@@ U in the German , which has yet to rati@@ fy the Treaty , appear to have no in@@ kl@@ ing of the signific@@ ance and implications of the Constitution , as they have announced their intention to vote against it .
this is yet another example of the double ga@@ me which the C@@ S@@ U is so f@@ ond of playing , which involves being prog@@ res@@ sive here in Europe and f@@ lying the fla@@ g for the benefit of the outside world , but speaking out in opposition at home , just in case .
this is , however , one of their trad@@ itions , for it was the C@@ S@@ U that , in 19@@ 4@@ 9 , voted against Germany &apos;s B@@ asi@@ c La@@ w .
ladies and gentlemen : the tra@@ pp@@ ings of the European Union have become too small , and no longer su@@ it it in its new , ex@@ pan@@ ded form .
therefore it is f@@ it@@ ting that the new Constitution will re@@ place agreements that are currently in force and will lead to more effective functioning of the European Union .
it will also strengthen the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments , and thereby the voice of the citizens of the European Union .
as a member of the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture and E@@ duc@@ ation , I particularly support the ar@@ tic@@ les of the Constitution that rela@@ te to those areas .
I believe that it is important that the pre@@ am@@ ble emphas@@ ises the signific@@ ance of Europe &apos;s cultural tradition , Europe &apos;s human@@ is@@ tic leg@@ acy and the values that define the ess@@ ence of Europe and its citizens .
one of our greatest objectives is respect for our rich cultural and l@@ ing@@ uis@@ tic diversity , and concern for the protection and development of the European cultural leg@@ acy .
the Constitution guarantees freedom for ar@@ t and sci@@ ence , the right to education and professional training , equal rights for men and women , and the right of the han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed to be full members of society .
Article 9@@ 2 guarantees the safety of young people at work , and Article 9@@ 3 states that the family should enjo@@ y legal , economic and social security .
the ar@@ tic@@ les as written form a good basis for their implementation , but in s@@ pite of this the European Union must do much more than simply accept and rati@@ fy the Constitution .
above all , it must create the conditions under which the family is recognised as something preci@@ ous and young mar@@ ried cou@@ ples have the opportunity to create and n@@ ur@@ ture a family .
if we use immigration as the princi@@ p@@ al means of sol@@ ving dem@@ ogra@@ p@@ hi@@ c problems , this will je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e our cultural leg@@ acy , the languages of Europe , our culture , our fa@@ it@@ h , the European Union and European civil@@ isation in general - in short , all the values that we wish to preser@@ ve and strengthen through the Constitution .
because we in the 25 Member States have op@@ ted for this community , it is also f@@ it@@ ting that we do everything we can to ensure that it func@@ tions as well and effectively as possible .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and express my full support for the report we are deb@@ ating today .
tomorrow this House will express its support for the text which conclu@@ des a process of creating a constitution which has been ongoing for several dec@@ ad@@ es .
however , our work cannot stop here .
we still have to face the most difficult challenge : its approval and ratification by the European citizens .
without their support , the Constitution makes no sense .
as the honourable Members are well aware , we Spanish have a particular responsibility within this process , since the first referendum amongst European citizens will be held in my country on 20 February .
we all , therefore , have the responsibility of expla@@ ining the constitutional text to the European citizens , which in my case includes those Span@@ i@@ ards living outside of Spain and even outside of the European Union .
I am , therefore , pleased that in my country the majority of political parties , union@@ s and other representatives of civil society agree with us and are fully involved in this task of creating awareness of the content and scope of the Constitution , which is the only way to ensure broad participation and a positive response to this historic task .
Mr President , the road to this Constitutional Treaty was a long and ro@@ ck@@ y one , and a number of good proposals fel@@ l by the wa@@ y@@ side .
now , though , we need this Constitution , and ratification by the Member States must progress quickly .
the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers , including R@@ ob@@ er@@ t S@@ c@@ human and K@@ on@@ ra@@ d A@@ den@@ au@@ er , laid the foun@@ dations for the European house .
their success@@ ors buil@@ t the w@@ all@@ s , b@@ ought the sh@@ el@@ ves and fi@@ lled these sh@@ el@@ ves with fil@@ es .
the con@@ ten@@ ts of this house are now pil@@ ing up to the ro@@ of , and we face the im@@ men@@ se task of cle@@ aring out this house and making it f@@ it for the future .
this is what the European Constitution will help us to do , and it represents a compromise which will mean greater op@@ enn@@ ess and tan@@ gible improvements for the European public .
existing Community legislation will be set out in a Treaty , which will make Europe easier to understand .
the common trade policy will play an ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary role in future in repres@@ enting our internal market to the outside world , and the enlarged Union &apos;s capacity to act will be strength@@ ened by a small@@ er Commission and by a new EU Foreign Minister .
citizens will gain more rights , and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , as draf@@ ted by R@@ oman Her@@ z@@ o@@ g , will be en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed in the Constitution .
the European Parliament &apos;s role will be strength@@ ened ; it will elec@@ t the President of the Commission .
it is to be hop@@ ed that in future leading politicians from European parties will stand for this post .
the Constitutional Convention allowed us too to bring our influence to bear on the Constitution , and Europe will not become a cen@@ tr@@ alist mon@@ s@@ ter state , but will instead be construc@@ ted according to the principle of subsidiarity .
the character@@ is@@ tic approach and principles of the larg@@ est group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , can also be seen in the Constitution , although unfortunately we did not succeed in pus@@ hing through all of our amendments , for some of which we f@@ ought b@@ it@@ ter@@ ly .
to give but two examples , I regret deep@@ ly that no reference to G@@ od has been included , and that the for@@ mula@@ s for qualified majority voting in the Council are so compl@@ icated .
I would however hope for all our sa@@ kes that this Convention is a foun@@ d@@ ation upon which we can continue to build Europe , and that this Europe will be one of peace , freedom and prosperity .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to express my gra@@ t@@ itude towards the honourable Members Mr de V@@ ig@@ o and Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t for an excell@@ ently prepared document , quite simply it is clear and highli@@ ghts the most significant issues .
ladies and gentlemen , the draf@@ ting of the Constitution is in line with the situation which has developed histor@@ ically in modern @-@ day Europe and which currently exists in the world .
ir@@ respec@@ tive of our will , globalisation processes are oc@@ curr@@ ing throughout the world , but initi@@ ally in goods and capital mo@@ v@@ ements , that is to say , in the re@@ al@@ m of material values .
the exchange of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al and mor@@ al values is taking place far more s@@ low@@ ly .
I believe that one of the reasons for conflicts in many places throughout the world today is largely due to the great dis@@ propor@@ tion and im@@ balance between the global exchange of material and sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al values .
the new Constitutional Treaty is a step towards reducing this dis@@ propor@@ tion .
this Treaty will not only help us understand more clearly who we are and where we are going , but will also provide greater clar@@ ity to our partners throughout the world as to our aims and the values which gu@@ ide our actions .
therefore , I repeat that this Constitution is well ti@@ med and necessary , despite certain short@@ com@@ ings .
one such short@@ coming , which Mr Poettering and other honourable Members have already referred to , is that it contains no reference to Christian values .
ladies and gentlemen , we may or may not ad@@ mit it , but we are Christi@@ ans , a@@ the@@ ists , Mus@@ lim@@ s or of other fa@@ i@@ ths .
what we call common European values have ev@@ ol@@ ved for cen@@ tu@@ ries and are based on Christian values .
ladies and gentlemen , all of us , including those who have partici@@ pa@@ ted in the draf@@ ting of the Constitution and those who have partici@@ pa@@ ted in the analysis and discussions , have an obligation to explain the signific@@ ance of this document to the citizens of our countries , as we cannot expect every European Union citizen to have read it .
unfortunately I should like to war@@ n against the tr@@ end seen in the Member States , where@@ by the Treaty is often used for short @-@ term discussions on domestic policy .
ladies and gentlemen , let us re@@ fra@@ in from this te@@ mp@@ tation and dis@@ courage our party members from doing l@@ ike@@ wise .
this is a long @-@ term document , which we , our children and also our neighbours need .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that today the Constitutional Treaty - the European Constitution - is becoming a reality .
the result of the Convention &apos;s work , on which we are to vote tomorrow , shows the will to introduce more democracy , transparency and efficiency into the European In@@ stitu@@ tions , strengthening them and making the decision @-@ making process more efficient .
the citizens are the real w@@ inn@@ ers , since the Constitution consolid@@ ates our common values and principles .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which the European Union has also published in min@@ i@@ a@@ ture ver@@ sion - just like all of the most preci@@ ous bo@@ o@@ ks in history - has been incorpor@@ ated into the Constitutional Treaty .
in my opinion , this is a fundamental sign of the transparency , solidarity and democracy of rights : the rights of the individual , of children , the el@@ der@@ ly and disab@@ led people .
this time these principles are being adopted precisely to bring our institution closer to the people , to put it am@@ id@@ st the people , so that we can provide the answ@@ ers they particularly need precisely at this time .
I therefore think that remo@@ ving society &apos;s bar@@ riers to ensure that citizens can participate fully in our united Europe is the most important aspect of our current activities .
Mr President , the last thing I want to do is to spo@@ il a party .
over the next 48 hours this Parliament will spen@@ d hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of euro on cel@@ e@@ bra@@ ting the Constitution .
we shall have b@@ all@@ o@@ ons , a las@@ er dis@@ play , an or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra ; but I cannot help feel@@ ing that all this is a tou@@ ch pre@@ ma@@ ture .
in at least ten countries there must be a referendum before ratification .
we cannot call the result of those po@@ lls with certainty .
not a single b@@ all@@ ot has yet been c@@ ast .
if it were only the party that was pre@@ ma@@ ture , it would be rather cur@@ mu@@ d@@ ge@@ only of me to ob@@ ject , but we are anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating the Constitution in other more important ways .
we are , for example , pus@@ hing ahead with the creation of an EU diplom@@ atic service , a proposal which , pen@@ ding for@@ mal ratification , has no legal basis .
in the field of justice and home affairs we have gone even further , pre @-@ emp@@ ting many of the Constitution &apos;s c@@ laus@@ es , in particular those to do with the creation of a p@@ an @-@ European legal system and a European public prosecu@@ tor .
before the Constitution had even been signed , let alone rati@@ fied , the European Court of Justice had indicated that it would tre@@ at the Charter of Fundamental Rights as justi@@ ci@@ able .
asked form@@ ally by this House what parts of the Constitution they intended to implement without waiting for official ratification , only five of the current Commissioners answ@@ ered that it would be wrong to anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the results of the national referendu@@ ms .
the other 20 all re@@ pli@@ ed in one way or another that they intended to for@@ ge ahead at once without waiting for the outcome of the national b@@ all@@ ots .
this is meant to be a democratic cha@@ mber , but its attitude sometimes rec@@ all@@ s Ber@@ tol@@ t B@@ re@@ ch@@ t &apos;s fam@@ ous cou@@ pl@@ et &apos; L@@ et us dis@@ mis@@ s the people and elec@@ t another in their place &apos; .
I hope my country will vote &apos; no &apos; to the Constitution and I am campa@@ ig@@ ning to that end , but if I lose , I shall accept the result with good gra@@ ce .
I would urge those of you who support the Constitution to dis@@ play a similar respect for the democratic process and not to try to implement large parts of this Constitution even if one or more Member States has voted against it .
no means no .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by addres@@ sing the citizens of Europe , and urg@@ ing them to care about the Constitution .
we must do everything in our power to ensure that the European public accep@@ ts this Constitution , because it will make Europe cle@@ ar@@ er and more citizen @-@ fri@@ en@@ dly , transparent and democratic .
my impression is that we are all in far too much of a h@@ ur@@ ry to get down to business as us@@ ual .
the Constitution is on the table , but it has not yet been rati@@ fied .
it is a political mil@@ es@@ t@@ one for the European Union , and for a more citizen @-@ fri@@ en@@ dly , transparent and democratic European Union .
so far , though , the Constitution has been a P@@ R disaster , and I should therefore like to war@@ n that we need an information and communication plan for all the European institutions , the Member States and the national parliaments , and we need a European Constitution W@@ e@@ ek in all the Member States .
we also need to abol@@ ish unanim@@ ity in the Council , thus strengthening the common , transparent and democratic Europe as provided for in the Constitutional Treaty .
I would call on the Heads of States or Government to ensure that it is the spirit of the Convention and of the sig@@ ning cer@@ em@@ on@@ y in R@@ ome which s@@ ets the t@@ one of domestic political debate , and not a lack of criticism and discussion , or alo@@ of@@ ness and in@@ difference .
what we need is for the debate on the Constitution to be Europe@@ an@@ ised , not for the ratification process to be nation@@ alised .
the Constitution is not merely a co@@ de of practice for the EU institutions ; it affec@@ ts all Europe &apos;s citizens .
we should however be fully aware that work will begin af@@ res@@ h with tomorrow &apos;s vote .
all that this vote must therefore do is to send out a clear signal .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t and Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o , who really have produced a mas@@ ter@@ pi@@ ece , making the Constitution more read@@ able .
the an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ oman jur@@ ists used to say : &apos; &quot; ( the law ar@@ ises out of the fact ) .
well , from the first day that Europe &apos;s foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers beg@@ an to dre@@ am , beg@@ an to imag@@ ine this common entity - a single entity drawing together mill@@ en@@ nia of history , ge@@ ograph@@ y , society and common values - well , from that moment the foun@@ ding fa@@ th@@ ers themselves thought of having common rules : what we today call the Constitution .
this is why I am extremely disap@@ pointed this morning to hear pro@@ min@@ ent fellow Members , whose freedom of expression I clearly respect , sta@@ ting their opposition to the draft Constitution .
people may op@@ pose this form of Constitution or the content of the Constitutional Treaty , but not common rules , since the establishment of these rules strength@@ ens soverei@@ gn@@ ty .
today we have to reach an agreement in a world under@@ going fundamental changes , including with regard to its systems and new sem@@ an@@ tics : those whose idea of soverei@@ gn@@ ty is as it was conc@@ eiv@@ ed in the ei@@ gh@@ te@@ ent@@ h and n@@ ine@@ te@@ ent@@ h cen@@ tu@@ ries are mis@@ taken .
today the new concept of soverei@@ gn@@ ty lies in subsidiarity : it is the soverei@@ gn@@ ty of local id@@ ent@@ ities , the soverei@@ gn@@ ty of citizens , the soverei@@ gn@@ ty of those who must help construc@@ t a legal system to interpre@@ t in the best possible way the ever more var@@ ied and complex needs of an ev@@ ol@@ ving society .
we cannot conc@@ eive of using the termin@@ ology which the jur@@ ists tau@@ ght us : feder@@ al state , conf@@ eder@@ al state , soverei@@ g@@ n state : Europe is a new entity , a Union , precisely , with which we must all identi@@ fy .
lastly , I would like to express my regret at the lack of a reference , not just to our Christian ro@@ ots , but also to Per@@ ic@@ le@@ an democracy - the origin of the very ess@@ ence of democracy - to the R@@ oman E@@ mp@@ ire and to Car@@ ol@@ ing@@ ian Europe .
let us hope that during the process of European integration these things will be re@@ memb@@ ered .
almost 50 years after the sig@@ ning of the Treaty of R@@ ome , that established the European Economic Union , finally Europe is going to have its own constitution .
for the first time , 4@@ 50 million citizens and 20 nations are going to be united by this document that defin@@ es the values and principles of this European Union .
the ratification of this constitution will lead us to a more democratic Europe .
the Charter of Fundamental Rights was introduced in this constitution and thus the rights of each person are lis@@ ted and every citizen may invo@@ ke this char@@ ter wh@@ en@@ ever he or she thin@@ ks that his or her rights have been bro@@ ken .
the social rights are also a priority and are so by a legal dec@@ re@@ e , the right to education , the right that every citizen can have access to information , protection in the case of an un@@ just ex@@ pul@@ sion and the right that the requests for a review in the case of discrimination on the basis of clas@@ s can be san@@ c@@ tioned , all have been defined and can be implemented .
the role of the European Parliament has therefore been gre@@ atly strength@@ ened and the Parliament together with the Council is going to be responsible to rati@@ fy almost all the documents .
the role of the national Parlia@@ ments will be strength@@ ened as well , and this is because it will be responsible to over@@ see that any agreement between the European Union and the Member States is respected , and therefore the national Parlia@@ ments will have enough power to put pressure on the European Commission so that it can revis@@ e its proposals .
in other words , the European Constitution will help so that we can have a more efficient Europe .
Europe , that has been buil@@ t in sta@@ ges , and that is based on Treaties that have been agreed upon along the years ; from now on@@ wards we will really have one Europe .
the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the clear recognition of European values and objectives are now giving us the opportunity , as European citizens , to call this document &apos; The European Constitution &apos; .
I am going to vote in favour .
I appeal my colleagues to do l@@ ike@@ wise for the good of European citizens .
.
Mr President , in respon@@ ding to this debate I wish to begin by thanking all those who paid tribu@@ te to the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the report it produced .
it is clear that this Constitution has very broad support across the political spec@@ tru@@ m and across Member States .
I am h@@ ope@@ ful that in the vote tomorrow there will be at least a two @-@ thir@@ ds majority in favour of it , with more than 4@@ 00 votes in favour in this Parliament , and that will send a power@@ ful signal .
let me also respond to the critic@@ isms that have been made of the Constitution .
they seem to be tw@@ of@@ old .
firstly , there are those who say they op@@ pose the Constitution because it does not go far enough .
they say it will certainly make the EU more democratic , social and so on , but not enough so .
my answer to them is that the choice at the moment is between the new Constitution and the old one - our current Treaties .
if the new Constitution contains improvements , then it is better to take the new Constitution rather than carry on living with the old one .
that is an argument I would also put to those who compla@@ in that there is no reference to Christi@@ an@@ ity in the new Constitution .
there is no such reference in the current Treaties , although they were draf@@ ted by Sa@@ int S@@ c@@ human .
however , the new Constitution contains a reference to our religious her@@ ita@@ ge and other her@@ ita@@ ges , and its values are Christian values and also the values of many others .
they are values that Christi@@ ans , non @-@ Christi@@ ans , people of other religi@@ ons and of no religi@@ on share .
many op@@ pon@@ ents of this Constitution con@@ j@@ ure up fe@@ ars of a super@@ state ; many are opposed to the very existence of the European Union .
that is ill@@ ustra@@ ted by those who op@@ pose the su@@ pre@@ ma@@ cy of Union law over the law of Member States , which is after all the current situation .
what is the point of agre@@ eing common laws across Europe if one does not want those laws to be applied across Europe ?
that is the whole point of agre@@ eing common European legislation in the areas we want it , such as the environment and the common market .
there is no point in having that legislation if you are against it in the first place .
to those people I would say : be hon@@ est and campaign for what you really believe in , which is your country lea@@ ving the European Union , and do not h@@ ide behind atta@@ cking the Constitution .
what n@@ on@@ sense to say that this new Constitution will create a cen@@ tr@@ alised super@@ state !
cen@@ tr@@ alised , the European Union ?
when it is based on a Constitution that conf@@ ers powers on the European Union with the agreement of every single Member State on the ratification of tre@@ aties ?
that is the only power the Union has .
even in exerc@@ ising its powers , the Council - i@@ .@@ e@@ . the Member States - has a central role in taking decisions , while the central administration - the European Commission - has fe@@ wer employees than the C@@ ity of Le@@ ed@@ s , in my constitu@@ ency .
some super@@ state !
let me conclude by saying that this debate is par@@ tly one of my@@ th against reality .
I am sure that by broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting the facts and enab@@ ling a true analysis of the Treaty we will contribute to an hon@@ est debate which will per@@ su@@ ade people that this Constitution is worth having .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should firstly very much like to thank Parliament for this constructive and largely positive debate .
I am able broad@@ ly to conc@@ ur with what has just been said by one of the rapporteurs concerning both the quality of this debate and the conclusions that must be drawn from it .
moreover , it was this Parliament that ins@@ ti@@ g@@ ated this constitutional process .
as some@@ one pointed out this morning , it was in this House that the constitutional process beg@@ an , and I should like to pay tribu@@ te , on behalf of the Presidency , to Al@@ ti@@ ero S@@ pin@@ ell@@ i who , with his draft European Constitution of 198@@ 4 , initi@@ ated this process and set it going by introducing a first stage , known as the S@@ ing@@ le A@@ c@@ t , negoti@@ ated moreover under the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
I should also like to say to those who have atta@@ c@@ ked and critic@@ ised this draft Constitution that , in a democratic debate , we obviously respect their position .
it is not , however , with n@@ ine@@ te@@ ent@@ h century dis@@ cour@@ ses that a vision is offer@@ ed to the peoples , European and others , of today &apos;s twenty @-@ first century world .
to turn in upon ourselves and return to out@@ mo@@ ded concep@@ ts of soverei@@ gn@@ ty are ina@@ dequate respon@@ ses in a glob@@ alised world .
they offer no solution at all in terms of prosperity , democracy and peace , neither to Europeans nor to others .
I should also like to say to those who draw a sub@@ t@@ le distinc@@ tion between a pr@@ o @-@ European &apos; no &quot; and an anti @-@ European &apos; no &quot; that there is only a &apos; no &quot; pur@@ e and simple , since a rejec@@ tion of the Constitution is simply a de@@ fe@@ at for Europe - a de@@ fe@@ at for a str@@ onger , more open , more transparent and more democratic Europe with perspec@@ tives to offer both within and beyond its own borders .
I therefore believe in the need not to become en@@ tan@@ g@@ led in sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of this kind .
ad@@ m@@ itte@@ dly , not everything is perfec@@ t in this Constitution , as the rapporteur said .
we should all have lik@@ ed to have seen improvements regarding this or that point .
is not , however , im@@ perfec@@ tion in a sense the very ess@@ ence of democracy , since democracy th@@ ri@@ ves on compromise ; and must we not therefore be capable now of accep@@ ting a compromise that represents progress in order to make further progress in the future ?
as several speakers have said , the Constitution provides a sound basis for our shared values .
it sup@@ p@@ lies a democratic framework enab@@ ling the European Union to take more effective action where action is necessary , account having been taken of the principle of subsidiarity .
as has been said , the EU &apos;s mo@@ t@@ to , &apos; United in diversity &quot; character@@ ises the ess@@ ence of this Europe .
a balance between large and small Member States , equality between citizens and the respect for national id@@ ent@@ ities mentioned by several speakers are the very ess@@ ence of our EU , reflec@@ ted very well in this constitutional document .
advan@@ ces have been made . they are perhaps in@@ sufficient .
we should have lik@@ ed to have gone further in the Justice and Home Affairs or external policy sp@@ her@@ es , but I believe that the draft Constitution is an extremely important first stage .
nor should re@@ v@@ isions be considered just at this time .
ad@@ m@@ itte@@ dly , every constitution needs to provide for revision mechanisms , as this one does ; in fact , it provides for various types of mechanism .
improvements will come as the years go by , on condition that this Constitution is adopted and that we are capable of applying it and using it to construc@@ t a genuine European democracy .
this document has been prepared with the broad participation not only of MEPs and of parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans and other representatives from the Member States but also of representatives of civil society .
there has been a debate , al@@ be@@ it an ina@@ dequate one , in civil society .
this debate must be encoura@@ ged and supported , particularly through the ratification procedures that , as has been emphas@@ ised , have already been comple@@ ted in two countries and that are to begin in other countries too .
in this respect , Article 1.@@ 4@@ 7 , relating to particip@@ atory democracy , is an innovation , so much so that it is s@@ car@@ c@@ ely referred to in our national Con@@ stitu@@ tions .
it needs to be brought ali@@ ve and given practical content .
the debate on the adoption of the Constitution has therefore be@@ gu@@ n , and it must be extended .
citizens must be fully involved in it , whether or not there are referendu@@ ms .
I entirely agree with what the V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission said on the subject of communication , explanation and the efforts that must be made in order to make Europe better understood .
the Presidency conc@@ urs with this as@@ ser@@ tion .
I emphasise that this work must firstly be done in the Member States , for it is there that the people are building Europe .
it requires everyone &apos;s involvement : firstly , that of governments and parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans but also , I repeat , that of the representatives of civil society .
in the course of the next few months , the Presidency will contribute every@@ where it can , and every@@ where it must , to this process and will encourage this debate .
.
Mr President , I would like to thank you all for this long but sti@@ mula@@ ting debate .
the vas@@ t majority of the comments have rightly paid tribu@@ te to this excellent report and to the work of the co @-@ rapporteurs .
h@@ ope@@ fully , it will receive the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming support of this House tomorrow .
I am con@@ sci@@ ous that this report and the Constitution need to be put into histor@@ ical perspective .
this is the first time that the European Parliament has not had a list of regre@@ ts about the result of an Intergovernmental Conference , and we can ask one of the ve@@ ter@@ ans in this kind of work about this .
if I compar@@ e this report to the P@@ lan@@ as , M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o and T@@ sa@@ t@@ so@@ s reports , for example , it is the most positive assessment of the outcome of an Intergovernmental Conference .
I share the views of those calling for a wide and hon@@ est debate .
without debate we do not have a democracy and , without debate , we do not get closer to the truth .
it is therefore our responsibility to provide examples of how the Constitution will affect the daily lives of European citizens .
the word &apos; perfec@@ t &apos; has been mentioned .
I have been a Commissioner for only five years and I have not yet seen the &apos; perfec@@ t &apos; document .
if you look around , how could we find a perfec@@ t document ?
we will have to continue to compromise because we are 25 Member States with different trad@@ itions , languages , political decision @-@ making procedures and views .
we will have to show the will and the capa@@ bility to compromise .
this a compromise and it will have to be a compromise .
the words used this morning are worth rec@@ all@@ ing .
most of them are politically lo@@ ad@@ ed - pos@@ iti@@ vely or ne@@ g@@ ati@@ vely .
many have mentioned rights , democracy , op@@ enn@@ ess , effectiveness and values .
Mr M@@ é@@ n@@ de@@ z de V@@ ig@@ o remin@@ ded us this morning that the Constitution is the uni@@ que opportunity to guarantee the values of the Union .
we are united in our diversity but with a set of fundamental and social rights that brings us together .
these are the values we guarantee not just for us but for our children .
others have attemp@@ ted to descri@@ be the Constitution as resul@@ ting in a European super@@ state , a los@@ s of national soverei@@ gn@@ ty , or a wea@@ ken@@ ing of the role of the national parliaments .
they have already received a reply from Mr Cor@@ bet@@ t .
while I expect that we should have to provide concrete facts and examples of the benefits of the Constitution as compared to the Treaty of Nice , I also expect that those talking about national soverei@@ gn@@ ty or national parliaments should provide some facts .
has the role of national parliaments been wea@@ ken@@ ed ?
is it possible to s@@ ne@@ a@@ k through a European law without super@@ vision by the Member States or national parliaments ?
we have to be able to respond to those questions .
let us work on the basis of facts and the text of the Constitution .
this should be made acc@@ es@@ sible to our citizens in all the Member States , not just sc@@ are s@@ tor@@ ies or mis@@ concep@@ tions .
we also have to ensure that we are ready for the entry into force of the Constitution when it is rati@@ fied by all Member States .
we will sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der our responsibilities and so must the Member States .
it is not enough to hope that adoption in one Member State will lead to autom@@ atic accep@@ tance in the next country .
that is why in the Council I have pus@@ hed so strongly for proper national strateg@@ ies to be developed .
as Mr Bro@@ k has indicated , prepar@@ atory work has already be@@ gu@@ n on the entry into force of the Constitution and the European external action service that will assis@@ t the European Minister for Foreign Affairs .
we are not exactly ju@@ mp@@ ing ahead , but we have to start to be prepared .
we cannot simply wait and let another two years go by before we can implement the provisions .
we will have to prepared in the best possible way and find the right balance .
I agree that we must ensure respect for the text of the Constitution .
the speec@@ hes this morning from Members in the new Member States have ill@@ ustra@@ ted the historic value of the European project and the principles and values that it guarantees .
whether we need a b@@ ig@@ ger bo@@ at , a larg@@ er b@@ us or a larg@@ er d@@ ress siz@@ e , we all recognise that we have a sense of responsibility .
I look forward to join@@ ing you in that debate .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day at 12 noon .
the next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on ad@@ mission for employment .
Mr President , Mr Sch@@ mit , ladies and gentlemen , I have the hon@@ our of infor@@ ming Parliament that the Green Paper on economic mi@@ gration that I presented following agreement with my colleague , Commissioner S@@ pid@@ l@@ a , was adopted today by the C@@ olle@@ ge .
with this Green Paper , the Commission wishes to make a contribution to the current debate , a debate be@@ gu@@ n with the Tamper@@ e mandate concerning the most appropriate approach to the ad@@ mission of economic mi@@ grants and concerning the added value represented by the adoption of such a common framework .
within the framework of the programme de@@ vis@@ ed in The H@@ ag@@ ue , the European Council invi@@ ted the Commission to present , before the end of 2005 , a proposal for a common European approach to legal immigration for economic reasons .
three years ago , the Commission had addressed a proposal to the Council on this subject , but this was not followed up because of the re@@ lu@@ c@@ tance of several Member States to tackle the problem in a Community perspective .
the changes on the international stage , Europe &apos;s need for balanced management of the mi@@ gration p@@ hen@@ omen@@ on and of the latter &apos;s many political , social and security implications and , finally , the sig@@ ning of the Constitutional Treaty - which makes a clear distinc@@ tion between sub@@ jects that fall within national competences and those which have , either in addition or exclu@@ sively , a Community dimension - are factors that have led the Council to eng@@ age in ti@@ mely reflec@@ tions and that have put this problem back on the agenda .
the strategy de@@ vis@@ ed in The H@@ ag@@ ue defin@@ es objectives and establis@@ hes a timetable that the Commission intends to respect .
it is self @-@ ev@@ ident that preparing a proposal in this area demands a wide , comprehensive and transparent debate and , above all , the participation of institutional and social ac@@ tors in car@@ rying out the research for eval@@ uations , proposals and contributions .
indeed , police forces and the authorities responsible for conduc@@ ting in@@ qui@@ ries cannot have available to them all of the facts necessary for putting together both a pic@@ ture of local situations and of mi@@ gra@@ tory flo@@ ws from different regions of the world to each European country and a pic@@ ture of the conditions of integration that have already been met , or are to be promo@@ ted , for communities of citizens from outside the EU that already resid@@ e , or that are establishing themselves , in the EU .
indeed , these factors give rise to the sense of ins@@ ec@@ urity experienc@@ ed by our fellow citizens and , in combating them , we must not con@@ fine ourselves to reac@@ tions in stric@@ tly military or polic@@ ing terms .
on the contrary , political actions also have to be undertaken , beginning with a programme of initiatives designed to manage the f@@ low of growing economic em@@ i@@ gration towards , ine@@ vi@@ tably , our own countries that sometimes constitu@@ tes an un@@ den@@ i@@ able advantage for the European economy .
finally , the public debate laun@@ ched by the Commission in the form of its Green Paper will enable the Commission to collec@@ t a h@@ ost of data and information that it will be able to use as a basis for preparing the proposals that are requested from it by the Council and that we shall present within the perio@@ ds laid down .
Mr President , lis@@ tening to Mr F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i , I was thinking of the mo@@ t@@ to of the fam@@ ous Belgian po@@ et , H@@ en@@ ri M@@ ic@@ ha@@ u@@ x , about never des@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing but allowing a solution to bu@@ b@@ ble up un@@ b@@ id@@ den .
I do believe that we must pay tribu@@ te to the Commission for not having des@@ pa@@ i@@ red but for having re@@ open@@ ed a necessary and useful debate .
President Sch@@ mit , you should sta@@ y , for this is very much your area .
we are , indeed , very keen to see the Commission &apos;s move bear fru@@ it .
you failed on a previous attempt in this area , in s@@ pite of the Commission &apos;s initiative and in s@@ pite of Parliament &apos;s commitment .
it was the Council that was unable to bring about an agreement .
the question I put to you , Mr F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i - yes , it is to you that I am speaking - is this : what objective information do you have that lead@@ s you to think - and the question is , in truth , also addressed to Mr Sch@@ mit - that the b@@ loc@@ ks placed by the Council on the previous initiative are likely to be remo@@ ved today , a pros@@ pect about which we are , on the face of it , delighted , al@@ be@@ it - it has to be said - sli@@ ghtly sc@@ ep@@ tical .
Commissioner , I am , of course , like my fellow ME@@ P Mr B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges , delighted that the Commission and the European Parliament are continuing with their common efforts to open legal immigration ch@@ ann@@ els .
I should like , however , to put three questions to you , Commissioner .
the first is similar to Mr B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges &quot; question : what practical legislative measures are you considering taking , and what will you do to stop the Council b@@ loc@@ king such measures , as in the case of your first attempt in 2001 ?
the second question concerns your proposed sec@@ tor@@ al legislation for legal immigration .
does not this approach end@@ ang@@ er mi@@ grants &quot; rights by creating different reg@@ imes for each group ?
thirdly and finally , what measures will you adopt in order to link this immigration policy to a policy of European integration ?
Mr President , my questions follow on directly from Mrs R@@ our@@ e &apos;s comments .
firstly , we welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the initiative on this matter , and I hope that , this time , the Council not again stand in its way .
I believe that the European dimension of this task is more important than the individual interests of the Member States ; this is why it is essential for us to adopt European rules , as without such rules for this field we will be unable to create an internal market .
one could , however , be for@@ given for won@@ der@@ ing at this point what the precise nature of these European rules will be .
Mr F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i , I have no@@ tic@@ ed that in your statements so far you have failed to say that the key regulations which are already in force , such as the I@@ L@@ O Convention , will be taken as a basis .
what part will be played in the Green Paper by the key issues referred to in the I@@ L@@ O Convention on mi@@ grant workers ?
in this connection , I should like to note that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission to incorpor@@ ate these rules .
Mr F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i , we have decided to div@@ ide the questions into three , by group .
do you wish , therefore , to respond now to the statements made by the three speakers ?
. Mr President , I can answer the three questions , which concern the same basic issue .
I would like to thank Mr B@@ our@@ lan@@ ges and the Members who took the floor .
the first reason why I am reason@@ ably optimis@@ tic over the possibility of atta@@ ining a tan@@ gible result , namely the adoption of a European initiative , is that , with regard to 2001 , it was the European Council - the very institution which in 2001 did not allow a similar measure to be adopted - which in November 2004 called on the Commission to adopt a European initiative by the end of 2005 .
within the framework of the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme , the Heads of State or Government , that is , those at the highest political level , asked the Commission to go ahead and to do so quickly .
that , in my view , demonstra@@ tes a new awareness of the fact that only Europe can provide the added value for a strategy on legal immigration .
the second reason is that with respect to the past , we have ch@@ os@@ en what I would call a bo@@ tto@@ m @-@ up rather than a top @-@ down approach .
we have ch@@ os@@ en to laun@@ ch a debate with Parliament , with the European Economic and Social Committee , with emplo@@ yers &quot; associ@@ ations and trade union@@ s , so that we shall be ready to put forward a proposal only once we have ga@@ ther@@ ed sugges@@ tions .
I am conf@@ ident that this method will first of all enhan@@ ce the transparency of the debate , secondly it will allow members of civil society to participate more actively in this debate than in the past , and thirdly it will enable Member States to approve or reject the proposal that the Commission will table , having the views of their emplo@@ yers &quot; associ@@ ations , their trade union@@ s and the European Parliament on hand .
these elements will consolid@@ ate the work .
I therefore cannot pre@@ dic@@ t what tan@@ gible measures will be included in the Commission &apos;s initiative , precisely because today we are rela@@ un@@ ching a European debate with the aim of ga@@ ther@@ ing information and proposals which we shall sub@@ mit to a public hear@@ ing in about the m@@ iddle of this year , so that we can table a proposal by the end of 2005 .
at that time we will be in a better position to understand what the tan@@ gible measures will be .
I can only tell you that we intend to adopt a framework of minimum rules , to enable those who wish to work leg@@ ally to do so , and at the same time to give people a pre@@ view of the provisions with the minimum of bureauc@@ racy - there are currently 25 different rules on the ad@@ mission of mi@@ grant workers , one per country .
we intend to establish a European framework with which anyone outside Europe can fam@@ ili@@ ar@@ ise themselves be@@ fore@@ hand : that will also help , in our opinion , to prevent illegal immigration .
Mr President , Commissioner , we feel that it is certainly com@@ mend@@ able that immigrants are at last no longer considered a problem , but a res@@ ource - as the Green Paper expres@@ s@@ ly states - and that we are aim@@ ing for a permanent mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural and multi@@ religious dialogue .
we are concerned , however , by the produc@@ ti@@ vity approach , as , moreover , you y@@ our@@ self called it in an inter@@ view for an Italian new@@ s@@ paper : that is , the decision to make mi@@ gra@@ tory flo@@ ws cond@@ itional on the requirements of the European labour market .
the Green Paper inc@@ lines towards the possibility - just a possibility , but one which we intend to comment on - of making the ad@@ mission of an immi@@ grant cond@@ itional on a job va@@ can@@ cy which it has not otherwise been possible to f@@ ill with European Union workers , or on a Member State &apos;s specific needs in particular employment sectors .
Commissioner , do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European immigration policy , as well as a step back@@ wards from what many Member States have already achieved ?
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for the Green Paper .
since action was urg@@ ently required , and still is , I am delighted with it .
I have only just received the Green Paper , and so I have not had the chance to read the whole document , only the first few pa@@ ges .
I was immediately struc@@ k by something on pa@@ ge 5 , where as regards the form of future European legislation with a view to the planned harmonisation , three proposals have been made .
at least , the impression is created that three options are still open , namely the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal approach , the sec@@ tor@@ al approach and the so @-@ called common f@@ ast tra@@ ck procedure .
is it not , though , the case that , thanks to years of in@@ decision on the part of the Council , we have tac@@ it@@ ly already decided in favour of the sec@@ tor@@ al approach ?
I think that the P@@ ei@@ ll@@ on report about ad@@ mit@@ ting third @-@ country sci@@ ent@@ ists and res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers is a case in point .
that is bac@@ ked by the Council , and that may explain your optimis@@ m to some extent .
Mr President , Commissioner , many Members have not had si@@ ght of the Green Paper yet , but at this early stage we should set down for you some basic principles of what is a very welcome discussion .
first , as my colleague Mrs R@@ our@@ e said , integration policy must be a vital com@@ pon@@ ent of any proposed legislation .
we know that we want to share best practice , but we still have a very va@@ gue position on integration policy .
secondly , managed mi@@ gration means all things to all Members in this House .
for some it may mean control , for some it may mean the right to family un@@ ity .
this is a big ga@@ p and we must define in this discussion what managed mi@@ gration actually means .
these are human beings coming from third countries to work in the European Union , they are not com@@ mod@@ ities .
we will have a set of principles and laws which will have to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date that .
finally , I very much welcome that civil society will have a much greater say , but we must then lis@@ ten to civil society , to the trade union@@ s and to business .
they have some good ideas , and we must not just pay li@@ p service to those ideas but create a managed mi@@ gration policy which will benefit both the European Union and those people and their families who are coming to benefit our econom@@ ies .
. Mr President , the three interven@@ tions allow me to for@@ mu@@ late one single comment .
firstly - and I am referring in particular to Mr F@@ a@@ va , who already knows this full well - a recognised , common , wid@@ es@@ pread principle , com@@ mon@@ ly referred to as the principle of pre@@ ference for Community workers over third @-@ country workers , is not as@@ ser@@ ted for the first time , but merely repe@@ ated in the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union .
precisely to avoid the in@@ discrimin@@ ate and un@@ balanced application of this principle , we believe that we need to expl@@ or@@ e , with the help of civil society , trade union@@ s and businesses , what job opportunities exist for which there is no direct issue of taking work away from the citizens of our countries .
because , if this were the issue , clearly the impact of immigration on society would not be positive , where@@ as we must ensure that legal immigration lead@@ s to true integration .
this means workers being accepted into civil society and integrated into education , with real inclu@@ sion in society .
obviously , this matter is not addressed by the Green Paper , but is the subject of integration policies which will be the focus of a Commission action in 2005 .
these are areas that the Commission will be developing this year , in close cooperation with Parliament and the Presidency .
integration is an absolutely vital part of the process .
in this for@@ um we seek instead to lis@@ ten to sugges@@ tions as to how we can make European policy on the rec@@ ep@@ tion of third @-@ country workers uni@@ form : that is our aim .
I would reiterate once more to those who asked again that today I cannot give any options or prefer@@ ences among possible ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t solutions .
some@@ body asked me whether we could introduce an American @-@ sty@@ le gre@@ en c@@ ard .
the answ@@ ers will come from the public debate which will be starting , from Parliament and from the social ac@@ tors to whom we shall lis@@ ten .
with regard to one point I will , of course , confirm a commitment which you can already gu@@ ess : the Commission will not con@@ fine itself to lis@@ tening to advice , but will take into account the assess@@ ments and proposals that it ga@@ th@@ ers .
in conclusion , therefore , the Commission has two lines of action : turning what has until now been a national approach into a European approach , with the aim of promoting a more balanced policy , and above all , del@@ im@@ iting the p@@ hen@@ omen@@ on of legal immigration through a positive approach within our soci@@ eties .
this approach is essential for true integration , which it will be difficult to achieve without it .
Mr President , I thank the Commission for its initiative , which is extremely welcome .
let me try to put a new tw@@ ist on things .
there are ten@@ s of millions of Europeans living outside Europe who have bene@@ fi@@ ted from the immigration policy of other countries - not only the United States , but also Aus@@ tr@@ al@@ ia , South Africa , New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and many others .
these people - or a very interesting sa@@ mp@@ le of them - met for the first time during the Greek presidency in June 2003 in Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ik@@ i .
some of the most remar@@ ka@@ bly successful Itali@@ ans , Gre@@ e@@ ks , C@@ z@@ ech@@ s , Roman@@ ians and others living around the world came to tell us about their experi@@ ences .
their experience , as European citizens , of being integrated into those countries could be extremely help@@ ful to you , Commissioner .
I was involved in this and I would be happy to help your staff plan a meeting with these people .
I do not believe that any of us here feel that the rela@@ tives we have in third countries have har@@ med those countries , nor do the h@@ ost countries feel that they have har@@ med them .
so for us as Europeans to fear the no@@ tion of legal mi@@ gration so gre@@ atly goes against our personal experi@@ ences .
let us hear the experi@@ ences of these people .
their experi@@ ences might even enable us to make it easier for our own citizens - identi@@ fying as they will with them - to understand the benefits of legal mi@@ gration to Europe .
I have an obser@@ vation to make , or rather a question to ask of Commissioner F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i .
I am not fam@@ ili@@ ar with the Green Paper , but I would like this document to contain provisions to ensure that in future Europe will not be sus@@ pec@@ ted or acc@@ used , as has sometimes been the case with the United States , of ca@@ using a &apos; bra@@ in dra@@ in &quot; from poor countries .
we need to make sure that people who come to European univers@@ ities or scientific institu@@ tes to study or tra@@ in do not remain here for whatever reasons , whether working or not , as this represents a los@@ s for their own countries .
the countries affected are frequ@@ ently poor countries , whose development depen@@ ds to a large extent on the education of such an el@@ ite .
a policy must be developed which en@@ su@@ res that on the one hand it is possible to work here for a certain l@@ eng@@ th of time , but that on the other hand instruments also exist which would not so much force people to return as encourage them to do so , in order to put the knowledge and experience they have ga@@ ined to use in developing their own cul@@ tures and soci@@ eties .
Mr President , I have a sense of here , having draf@@ ted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on a number of these issues .
I have a number of questions .
what attention is going to be paid to the work that Parliament has already done on these issues ?
we have put forward a considerable number of proposals , which we discussed with civil society , trade union@@ s and business .
the trade union@@ s will demand par@@ ity of treatment for third country nationals coming to work in the European Union , so that they are not paid poor@@ ly to under@@ cut workers here .
business people will tell you that they want entry made easier so that they are not ac@@ ting as a par@@ all@@ el immigration system .
one of the things that have changed since Parliament last loo@@ ked at this is that we now have ten new Member States .
if we are looking at a hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y of movement for employment , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly the Commission is looking at remo@@ ving the trans@@ ition perio@@ ds for those new Member States as part of that change in the hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical system of entry for employment .
Mr President , I am particularly keen to pic@@ k up on Mrs Lam@@ ber@@ t &apos;s comments on trans@@ ition perio@@ ds .
we should do our best to avoid per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ating the ab@@ sur@@ d situation where@@ by third @-@ country nationals are invi@@ ted to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whilst restrictions on employment opportunities for those from EU Member States are still in place .
a balance of some kind must be found , and I am conf@@ ident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter .
I would however like to thank Commissioner F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue , above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens , as has been brought to my attention in many conver@@ sa@@ tions with groups and individuals affected .
on a sli@@ ghtly different note , I have no@@ tic@@ ed that the Green Paper is l@@ itte@@ red with a great many questions .
given that the issue of labour mi@@ gration is such a complex one , it would perhaps be better to leave some of these to one side , in line with the principle of &apos; keep it simple , stu@@ pid . &quot;
. I thank all Members of Parliament for their sugges@@ tions and opinions .
the fundamental purpose of this proposal is that legal mi@@ gration should be seen not as a problem but as an opportunity for all of us and for Europe in particular .
in this period we will laun@@ ch a public debate .
we will take into account the work already done by Parliament , particularly on equality of rights and opportunities for legal mi@@ grants .
we will take into account sugges@@ tions , concrete proposals , and we will consider all proposals as a very positive contribution in the spirit of open and fran@@ k cooperation .
I should like to mention the important issue of &apos; bra@@ in dra@@ in &apos; .
this issue of bra@@ in dra@@ in and what to do about it will be one of the key sub@@ jects in the particular and specific communication on mi@@ gration and development , which the Commission will present in S@@ pring 2005 .
I can already assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the ac@@ u@@ ten@@ ess of this problem , particularly in specific countries and sectors such as heal@@ th@@ care .
the Commission intends to propose a ta@@ il@@ or @-@ made approach where respon@@ ses could be made that are commen@@ su@@ rate with the ma@@ gn@@ itude of this very important and sensitive problem .
in this way , we will put emphasis on the positive impact that mi@@ gration can have on countries of origin .
finally , I can assure you that this problem will be taken fully into account by the Commission .
that conclu@@ des the item on the Commission communication on the Green Paper on ad@@ mission for employment .
I should like to thank Commissioner F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i and the speakers .
Mr Or@@ tuon@@ do L@@ ar@@ re@@ a has asked to be given the floor in order to make a personal statement .
Mr President , if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty , I would say , firstly , that it is integra@@ tion@@ ist ; secondly , that it is based on free accession ; thirdly , that it is respec@@ t@@ ful of different id@@ ent@@ ities , cul@@ tures , languages and institutional structures and cre@@ ates a European citiz@@ en@@ ship which does not exclu@@ de , but rather co @-@ exists with , other citizens from the Member countries .
in the Bas@@ que country , our Parliament has just approved , by an absolu@@ te majority , a new Sta@@ tute for co @-@ existence with the Spanish State which , in fact , is ins@@ pi@@ red by the Community model , which maintain@@ s these same principles I have indicated and is respec@@ t@@ ful of the Constitutional Treaty .
nevertheless , in this morning &apos;s debate one Member has acc@@ used it of atta@@ cking the European Constitution and has said that the Bas@@ que President and the Bas@@ que Na@@ tion@@ alist Party have alli@@ ed themselves with the enem@@ ies of Europe .
that is entirely fal@@ se .
we are going to support a &apos; yes &quot; vote and we advoc@@ ate a &apos; yes &quot; to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum .
and we want to be able to live together in peace and fri@@ end@@ ship with the other peoples of the Spanish State , on the basis of mutual respect for different id@@ ent@@ ities and languages , free accession and common work within a united Europe .
we Bas@@ qu@@ es have supported European integration from the out@@ set , and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty .
the next item is Ques@@ tion T@@ ime , with questions to the Commission ( B@@ 6 @-@ 00@@ 01 / 2005 ) .
as a result of the proposal adopted by the Commission on 26 October , tex@@ ti@@ le im@@ port quo@@ ta@@ s are going to be ab@@ olis@@ hed from 1 January 2005 .
in terms of industrial restruc@@ turing and employment , this decision is going to have very major consequences for some of the Union &apos;s regions .
econom@@ ists in the Nor@@ d @-@ P@@ as @-@ de @-@ C@@ ala@@ is region are already speaking about the los@@ s of 9 000 of the 29 000 direct jobs in the tex@@ ti@@ le industry in that area .
a ver@@ itable human trag@@ edy a@@ wa@@ its the workers concerned and their families .
what specific aid measures is the Commission going to take to safeguard and develop employment in the EU &apos;s major tex@@ ti@@ le industry regions , particularly in terms of structural funding and combating in@@ tra@@ - and ex@@ tra @-@ European re@@ loc@@ ation processes ?
honourable Members , I am respon@@ ding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Man@@ del@@ son , who is unable to be here today as he is currently on his way to In@@ dia .
the WTO Agreement on T@@ ex@@ ti@@ le and C@@ lo@@ thing , which established a ten @-@ year period for the elimin@@ ation of the quo@@ ta@@ s , ex@@ pi@@ red on 31 December 2004 , and trade in tex@@ ti@@ le and c@@ lo@@ thing products is h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th subject to the general WTO rules .
quo@@ ta remo@@ val is likely to res@@ ha@@ pe the export of tex@@ ti@@ le and c@@ lo@@ thing and global out@@ s@@ our@@ cing tr@@ ends .
there may be a sub@@ stitu@@ tion effect among sup@@ pli@@ ers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products , econom@@ ies of scale , competitive prices and efficient services .
the impact of ab@@ olis@@ hing quo@@ ta@@ s will indeed be considerable , though it is difficult to ass@@ ess at this stage .
moreover , it is likely to var@@ y gre@@ atly depen@@ ding on country conditions , the ability to achieve competitive advantages in the higher value added production se@@ g@@ ment and domestic policy respon@@ ses .
sustain@@ ed efforts are needed to help up@@ gra@@ de the s@@ k@@ ill levels of workers , improve the quality of their jobs and em@@ power social partners at all levels to address the many challenges in the sector .
as far as Europe is concerned , this sector defin@@ i@@ tely has ass@@ ets for the future .
investment , a move up@@ market and world lead@@ ership in the fas@@ hi@@ on industry have made Europe the world &apos;s b@@ ig@@ g@@ est ex@@ por@@ ter of tex@@ til@@ es and its second b@@ ig@@ g@@ est ex@@ por@@ ter of c@@ lo@@ thing .
the Commission believes that this enta@@ ils a three @-@ pr@@ ong@@ ed response : monitor the level of impor@@ ts into the EU , help the sector strengthen its competitiveness and remain a key industry in the EU , and keep a special focus on the poor@@ est and more v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able developing countries .
the Commission communication of 13 October 2004 , entitled &apos; T@@ ex@@ til@@ es and C@@ lo@@ thing after 2005 &apos; , is a key element of this strategy .
this communication was a response to the set of recommendations by the Hi@@ gh L@@ ev@@ el Group on T@@ ex@@ til@@ es and C@@ lo@@ thing , in which trade union@@ s were represented .
on structural funding and re@@ loc@@ ation processes , the participation of the tex@@ ti@@ le and c@@ lo@@ thing sector in mul@@ tis@@ ec@@ tor@@ al programmes should provide an efficient framework for supporting the sector , allow for di@@ versi@@ fication of production and ultimately serve the economic interests of the regions in question .
in addition , the Commission proposes that in all future programmes , Member States should reser@@ ve an amount of 1 % of the Structural Fund &apos;s annual contribution for the &apos; Con@@ ver@@ g@@ ence &apos; objective and 3 % of the Structural Fund &apos;s annual contribution for the &apos; Regional competitiveness and employment &apos; objective , to cover unfor@@ eseen local or sec@@ tor@@ al cris@@ es linked to economic and social restruc@@ turing or to the consequences of trade opening .
Madam President , allow me to express to this House my hear@@ t@@ felt solidarity with the millions of employees who will see their lives sha@@ tte@@ red in the interests of satis@@ fying , once again , a minority of aff@@ lu@@ ent people .
indeed , the econom@@ ists of the International F@@ eder@@ ation of Trade Uni@@ ons talk of what they , if not the Commission , know will be the destruction of thir@@ ty million jobs , a million of them in Europe , North Africa , S@@ ri Lan@@ ka and Indon@@ es@@ ia .
as if what a number of these countries have just experienc@@ ed were not enough , they now find themselves in even deep@@ er tro@@ u@@ ble .
it is , I strongly emphasise , the Commission &apos;s , the Council &apos;s and Parliament &apos;s responsibility and duty to put a stop to this social disaster .
the Commission must be aware of the problem of forced and illegal child labour in the co@@ co@@ a industry .
W@@ est Africa provides most of the world &apos;s co@@ co@@ a , where over 200 000 children are thought to be working in ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous conditions on co@@ co@@ a f@@ arms ( International In@@ stitu@@ te of T@@ ro@@ p@@ ical Agriculture , July 2002 ) .
European consumers are faced with the possibility that some of the cho@@ c@@ ol@@ ate they e@@ at has been produced by forced labour .
could the Commission inform me of what initiatives it has undertaken to ensure that the tas@@ te of s@@ la@@ very is ir@@ ra@@ dic@@ ated from the European di@@ et ?
.
honourable Members , I am respon@@ ding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr M@@ ic@@ he@@ l , who is unable to be here this afternoon , as he must atten@@ d the don@@ ors &apos; conference on the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi disaster .
on this issue , the approach of the Commission is tw@@ of@@ old .
firstly , on the one hand , we support the initiatives and programmes of the I@@ L@@ O .
secondly , we reinfor@@ ce the capacity of the countries in the region to implement the relevant Coton@@ ou provisions and different Economic Community of W@@ est African States pro@@ to@@ c@@ ols and initiatives in the area of child protection .
the International L@@ ab@@ our Organisation , through its International Programme on the E@@ l@@ imin@@ ation of Ch@@ il@@ d L@@ ab@@ our , laun@@ ched in 2000 a new initiative called &apos; Com@@ b@@ ating Tra@@ ffic@@ king in Ch@@ il@@ dren for L@@ ab@@ our Ex@@ plo@@ itation in W@@ est and Central Africa &apos; .
in 2003 a &apos; W@@ est Africa Co@@ co@@ a / Com@@ mer@@ cial Agricul@@ tural Programme to Com@@ b@@ at Ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous and Ex@@ plo@@ ita@@ tive Ch@@ il@@ d L@@ ab@@ our &apos; was added , foc@@ using in particular on co@@ co@@ a farming .
the Commission has a strategic partnership with the I@@ L@@ O , in which the fight against child labour is a priority .
in that context , a programme of EUR 15 million under the ACP funds is currently under consideration .
the objectives would be , , firstly , to establish a sustainable mechanism to prevent children from car@@ rying out all sor@@ ts of labour in the agricultural and other sectors .
secondly , to strengthen the capacity of national and community @-@ level agencies and organisations in planning , initi@@ ating , implementing and evalu@@ ating action to prevent and prog@@ res@@ sively elimin@@ ate child labour .
thirdly , to remove all children involved in work in the co@@ co@@ a sector , to prevent children at risk from enter@@ ing such work , and to improve the income @-@ ear@@ ning capacity of ad@@ ult family members , particularly women , through social protection schem@@ es .
E@@ CO@@ W@@ A@@ S is active as a regional organisation in the fight against child labour .
in addition to the Coton@@ ou provisions on trade and labour standards , the E@@ CO@@ W@@ A@@ S Heads of State have adopted a declaration and a plan of action to fight child explo@@ itation , and E@@ CO@@ W@@ A@@ S has recently set up a child uni@@ t in its sec@@ re@@ tari@@ at .
the 9@@ th E@@ D@@ F Regional In@@ dic@@ ative Programme will provide capacity @-@ building to this new uni@@ t within E@@ CO@@ W@@ A@@ S , with a view to promoting the effectiveness of its work .
I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the I@@ L@@ O and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public d@@ oma@@ in .
I wonder whether the Commission is actually considering a more positive agenda with regard to companies who are making prof@@ its out of this at the moment , by perhaps ins@@ is@@ ting that unless European companies - and do not forget that Europeans and North Americ@@ ans consu@@ me most of these co@@ co@@ a products - can give a guarantee that they are not making their products and prof@@ its on the back of child labour , then they cannot im@@ port them into Europe .
has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it ?
. the Commission believes that the framework of the Coton@@ ou Agreement between the EU and the 7@@ 7 ACP countries gives real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice , as well as the cor@@ ruption element that may be linked to it , through political dialogue and support for good governance in ACP countries .
moreover , it considers that poverty and the lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for explo@@ ita@@ tive child labour and child trafficking .
the pover@@ ty@@ - reduction approach through EU development cooperation is a sound basis for tac@@ kl@@ ing the problem as it gives priority to equ@@ itable growth and to better access to education .
finally , the Coton@@ ou Agreement represents an important step forward in promoting C@@ L@@ S in bilateral agreements .
Article 50 includes a specific provision on trade and labour standards , which re@@ aff@@ ir@@ ms the commitments of the Par@@ ties to international C@@ L@@ S as defined by the relevant I@@ L@@ O Con@@ ven@@ tions .
is the Commission aware of the fact that the world C@@ ho@@ c@@ ol@@ ate Man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue ?
would the Commission therefore under@@ take to look at the report that is due in the m@@ iddle of this year from the international cho@@ c@@ ol@@ ate manufac@@ tur@@ ers , commen@@ d them on the work that they have been doing and encourage them to continue to develop their cer@@ ti@@ fication programme ?
I am at a los@@ s as to why cho@@ c@@ ol@@ ate has been sing@@ led out in this respect because there are many other food products being s@@ our@@ ced from Th@@ ir@@ d World countries where the same issues per@@ tain - labe@@ lling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector .
.
I will certainly bring Mr Har@@ bour &apos;s comments to Mr M@@ ic@@ he@@ l &apos;s attention .
I propose that the Commission immediately commen@@ ce talks with the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation on the threat of a sus@@ pension of and ra@@ ising bar@@ riers against food exports to Russia from Pol@@ and and other new Member States .
these talks should help facilitate , nor@@ m@@ alise , acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate and define the inspec@@ tion criteria .
I wish to express my in@@ dign@@ ation at the Commission &apos;s stated position that the issue of ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary inspec@@ tions by the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation is an internal matter for the above states .
this statement s@@ ma@@ cks of discrimination against the new Member States in EU internal relations , because Member States do not have the power to make independent decisions regarding ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary matters related to the im@@ port of products from third countries .
hence , it will be impossible to resolve the problem without dialogue between all the parties .
this situation is not new to the Commission , as it has already &apos; supported &apos; talks between France and the United States on a similar matter .
. I am respon@@ ding to this question on behalf of my colleague , Mr Ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou , who is unable to be here today , as he is un@@ well .
the Commission has made all reasonable efforts to avoid dis@@ ruption in exports of animal and pl@@ ant products from the European Union to Russia .
this potential dis@@ ruption ar@@ ises from Russian ins@@ is@@ tence that EU exports meet its specific im@@ port requirements .
for animal products , there was the concrete concern that trade would be totally b@@ loc@@ ked from 1 January 2005 .
from this date , in fact , Russia ins@@ ists on a single set of san@@ i@@ tary cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates for impor@@ ts .
however , negotiations led by the Commission on behalf of the EU have aver@@ ted this risk .
as regards pl@@ ant products , where a similar risk to exports could materi@@ alise from 1 April 2005 , the Commission intended to start negotiations as soon as the risk emer@@ ged , and asked the Council to endorse this .
following a debate among Member States on the basis of this request , the A@@ G@@ R@@ I Council in December 2004 agreed and the Commission immediately started negotiations on these issues on behalf of the EU .
the Commission is conf@@ ident that this will lead to a successful outcome .
the honourable Member can be assu@@ red , therefore , that although the Commission has very little competence in relation to export requirements in third countries , it has expressed its willingness and has been pro@@ active in view of helping to solve this kind of problem and , as soon as the Commission was given the gre@@ en light from the Council , it eng@@ aged in ti@@ mely negotiations .
in the course of negotiations , no distinc@@ tion has been made between the new and former Member States .
however , Russia has ins@@ is@@ ted on inspec@@ ting all establis@@ h@@ ments in the new Member States which have requested approval for export .
the Commission has highli@@ ghted that these same establis@@ h@@ ments have been approved for in@@ tra @-@ EU trade following the enlargement process .
it has also pres@@ sed for the inspec@@ tion process to be carried out as quickly as possible .
overall , this situation has un@@ doub@@ tedly led to dis@@ ruption in the trade of these Member States with Russia , and it is not made easier by the fact that Russia is not a member of the WTO and does not therefore consider itself b@@ ound by the rules of the WTO .
the honourable Member may rest assu@@ red that the Commission has involved all Member States in the efforts to avoid trade dis@@ ruption , in particular the new Member States .
these efforts are continuing and the Commission will continue to defend the Community interest .
Madam President , Commissioner , the situation is more dra@@ matic than might be sup@@ posed from the Commissioner &apos;s reply .
since 1 May , Russia has been playing g@@ am@@ es and not accep@@ ting goods from Pol@@ and in re@@ ta@@ li@@ ation for the ref@@ us@@ al by certain countries , such as the Bal@@ tic countries , to accept Russian impor@@ ts because they failed to meet the san@@ i@@ tary requirements laid down by the EU .
Member States do not , however , have the power to take independent decisions on ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary matters relating to impor@@ ts of products from third countries .
I would ask you to take urgent action on this matter .
.
as I stated in my reply , the Commission has treated this matter with considerable urgency , when we asked the Council to give us the go @-@ ahead and when we eng@@ aged in negotiations .
the honourable Member is correct that it im@@ poses certain major difficulties on some of these countries and the Commission will do its very best to achieve a satisfactory solution .
however , I must stress the limits of what we can achieve .
h@@ ope@@ fully , with go@@ od@@ will on all sides , the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the ne@@ ar future .
there is wid@@ es@@ pread concern that the draft Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive , particularly its &apos; country of origin &apos; provision , may lead to social du@@ mp@@ ing and a &apos; ra@@ ce to the bo@@ tto@@ m &apos; in service provision .
will the Commission now with@@ draw the draft directive and initi@@ ate a process of consultation aimed at producing a more balanced proposal , while also taking into account the need for a Fra@@ mework Directive to enable deli@@ very of high @-@ quality services of general interest / public services ?
.
the Commission wishes to stress that remo@@ ving internal market bar@@ riers is not tan@@ tam@@ oun@@ t to undermin@@ ing the quality of services , or that the Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive will lead to social du@@ mp@@ ing - quite the contrary .
as regards the protection of workers , the proposed directive does not affect the existing Community , namely the Pos@@ ted Wor@@ kers &quot; Directive from 1996 .
this directive provides that pos@@ ted workers , including temporary workers , enjo@@ y , ir@@ respec@@ tive of the law applic@@ able to the employment relationship , a number of important protec@@ tive provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the work@@ er is pos@@ ted .
therefore , companies cannot use this proposal in order to establish themselves in low @-@ w@@ age countries to circum@@ v@@ ent the social protection of the h@@ ost Member State .
in addition , the proposed directive reinfor@@ ces the control of pos@@ ted workers because it establis@@ hes a system of cooperation between Member States and obli@@ ges the country of origin of the service provid@@ er to assis@@ t the authorities of the h@@ ost Member State in the super@@ vision of working conditions .
the proposed directive will thus help to prevent social du@@ mp@@ ing .
the Commission does not share the concern that the directive will lead to a &apos; ra@@ ce to the bo@@ tto@@ m &apos; in service provision .
first , the country of origin principle only applies to the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
for services provided via an establishment in another Member State - for example a h@@ os@@ p@@ ital or a home for the el@@ der@@ ly - the service provid@@ er will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State .
second , the country of origin principle is emb@@ ed@@ ded in harmonisation and enhan@@ ced administrative cooperation between Member States .
moreover , a number of der@@ og@@ ations from the country of origin principle cover , for instance , the applic@@ able working conditions in the context of pos@@ ting of workers , consumer contracts , health and safety on building si@@ tes and public health .
finally , the Commission wishes to stress that the proposed directive does not require the liberalisation or priva@@ tis@@ ation of services which are currently provided at national , regional or local level by the public sector or public ent@@ ities .
neither does the proposal affect the freedom of the Member States to define what they consider to be services of general economic interest and how they should be organised or finan@@ ced .
furthermore , it does not affect Member States &apos; ability to maintain appropriate regulations concerning the quality , availa@@ bility and per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of services of general interest , or other regulations ensuring consumer and us@@ er rights .
it is also important to note that the proposal does not pre@@ jud@@ ge the work on , or the outcome of , specific Community initiatives , in particular the follow @-@ up to the White Paper on services of general interest .
the Commission has committed to a genuine dialogue with both co @-@ legisla@@ tors and interested parties with a view to finding solutions to specific areas of concern .
to date , the need for a major step forward in opening the internal market has not yet been val@@ id@@ ly con@@ tes@@ ted .
I am conf@@ ident that also the honourable Member would like to see companies , consumers and workers enjo@@ y the benefits of an open and competitive integrated services market .
we are all aware of the economic and social challenges facing the European Union .
be@@ aring in mind the importance of the services sector , the proposed directive will contribute signific@@ antly to addres@@ sing these challenges .
firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Ques@@ tion T@@ ime in Parliament .
I look forward to more .
I am a little be@@ w@@ il@@ der@@ ed by the Commissioner &apos;s reply .
his reply indic@@ ates that this directive will do nothing , that it is not going to affect any of the areas about which we have expressed concern .
he says it will only apply to temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
in what way , then , will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market ?
if it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross @-@ border provisions , how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market ?
.
as I pointed out in my reply , the country of origin principle applies only to the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
the rest of the directive de@@ als with any other areas .
if services are provided via an establishment in another Member State , the service provid@@ er will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State .
I should like to point out to the honourable Member that I would accept that the Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive is very ambitious : it aims to provide an over@@ ar@@ ching framework .
I am aware of the concerns of many Members of this Parliament and people outside this Parliament .
I am very con@@ sci@@ ous that it has raised the political tem@@ per@@ a@@ ture in a number of Member States .
I have ente@@ red into an open and constructive dialogue with Members , and I will continue to do that .
I look forward to future commun@@ ications from your rapporteur to ass@@ ess parlia@@ menta@@ ri@@ ans &apos; views within the committee responsible .
would the Commissioner agree that it is vi@@ ta@@ lly important for Members of this House to understand the huge vari@@ ety of discrimin@@ atory and anti @-@ competitive practices that Member States currently apply against service provid@@ ers ?
it would be very help@@ ful if you could explain these in more detail to Members of this Parliament who per@@ sis@@ t in descri@@ b@@ ing this directive in the entirely un@@ justified terms you have so convinc@@ ingly dis@@ mis@@ sed in your answer of &apos; social du@@ mp@@ ing &apos; and a &apos; ra@@ ce to the bo@@ tto@@ m &apos; .
there is no evidence wha@@ t@@ so@@ ever that either of those things will happen , and it would be help@@ ful if the job creation fac@@ et in@@ her@@ ent in this directive were properly commun@@ icated .
.
I certainly agree with the honourable Member that the opportunities for job creation from an opening @-@ up of the services market throughout Europe are im@@ men@@ se .
various studies have been initi@@ ated , and there are great opportunities for job creation .
given that services account for well over 60 % of the Union &apos;s G@@ DP , it is clear that any improvement in the services area is going to lead to an increase in we@@ alth and jobs for people in the Union .
I agree with the honourable Member that many anti @-@ competitive practices exist in lo@@ ts of Member States that prevent the real opening @-@ up of the services market .
the services directive is attemp@@ ting to open up the services area to the benefit of every@@ body in Europe .
but having said that , and in reply to the earlier question from Mr De R@@ ossa , I am also con@@ sci@@ ous of the specific concerns expressed by Members .
h@@ ope@@ fully , during the parliamentary process and other processes we will be able to te@@ ase these concerns out further .
if you take the quali@@ fications that the Commissioner expressed in his answer to the first question at face value , it is clear that this directive would not apply to the UK health service , which is based on care that is free at the point of use .
if we can take his reas@@ sur@@ an@@ ces at face value , why does he not simply exclu@@ de health from the scope of this directive ?
.
the approach that I have adopted with the European Parliament and others who have raised concerns is to have those concerns and problems put on the table and into a document .
I would not wish to start with a list of the ite@@ ms I think should be remo@@ ved .
that would not be the correct approach .
I accept that this is a very ambitious document , what we are trying to achieve is worth fighting for .
people come to various issues in this House from various perspec@@ tives , with their own experi@@ ences and political and economic ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ies .
what we all have to accept is that if Europe is to meet the challenges of the future and keep the social protection model and other things that we as@@ p@@ ire to and want in Europe , we have to ensure that the European economy gro@@ ws .
standing still is not an option .
the Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive attemp@@ ts to open up this particular market .
as I pointed out in reply to Mr Har@@ bour , services make up the b@@ ul@@ k of the European Union &apos;s economic activity , therefore it is a goal well worth fighting for .
in early 2004 , the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive on services as a crucial contribution to the pursu@@ it of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy .
this proposal has pro@@ vo@@ ked a great deal of debate , including strong support as well as fi@@ er@@ ce opposition from some quar@@ ters .
what conclusions does the Commission draw from the reac@@ tions that the proposal has gener@@ ated ?
could the Commission indic@@ ate why it has ch@@ os@@ en to table a proposal with such a broad scope and why it is putting so much emphasis on the role of the country of establishment of the service provid@@ er ?
why did the Commission not op@@ t for a sector @-@ by @-@ sector approach ?
what is the role of the service sector in the EU &apos;s economy , and what part of this involves cross @-@ border activities ?
what tan@@ gible results relevant to the Lisbon O@@ b@@ jec@@ tives does the Commission hope to achieve with this proposal ?
. as the honourable Member has pointed out , the proposed Directive on services in the internal market is at the heart of our efforts to reform the European economy .
services account for appro@@ xim@@ ately 70 % of EU G@@ DP and employment .
the remo@@ val of internal market bar@@ riers in the area of services , as for@@ eseen by the proposal , is essential for meeting the growth and employment targets which li@@ e at the heart of the Lisbon Agenda .
the potential economic opportunities ar@@ ising from this proposal are indeed huge .
this has been under@@ lined by recent Dutch economic research which shows that implementation of the proposal in its current form could result in an increase in bilateral trade and direct foreign investment in commercial services by 15 % to 35 % .
the Commission has proposed a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal directive for several different reasons .
first , a broad range of services is dealt with because many of the bar@@ riers identi@@ fied are common to various service activities .
the most efficient way to address these bar@@ riers is in a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal way .
secondly , a large scale and detailed harmonisation process through sec@@ tor@@ al directives would be un@@ necessary , un@@ realistic and in@@ consistent with better regulation and subsidiarity principles .
thirdly , the services proposal takes into account the specific@@ ity of certain activities , proposes specific harmonisation where this is de@@ em@@ ed necessary and adop@@ ts a ph@@ ased approach to implementation .
it is clear that the proposal has pro@@ vo@@ ked a great deal of discussion .
however , this is exactly what a proposal this ambitious and far @-@ reaching can be expected to do .
it shows that the proposal is addres@@ sing some very important questions .
at the same time , this also means that there is a lot of work to be done to achieve a common goal .
the country of origin approach is a central element of the proposal , as far as the cross @-@ border supply of services is concerned .
it el@@ im@@ ina@@ tes the problem of cross @-@ border services being subject to a mul@@ t@@ itude of different rules .
this will sti@@ mu@@ late the offer of cross @-@ border services and improve the competitiveness of the EU economy .
the country of origin approach is in particular essential for S@@ ME@@ s , who do not have the means to establish a subsidi@@ ary or an office in another Member State and therefore can export their know @-@ how only by the temporary cross @-@ border provision of services .
I wish to note , however , that the country of origin approach does not apply for services provided through a fi@@ xed commercial presence in the h@@ ost country .
at the same time , I wish to reiterate that the country of origin approach does not operate in is@@ ol@@ ation .
over and above the specific harmonisation for@@ eseen for certain activities , the proposal also fores@@ e@@ es the further development of administrative cooperation between Member State authorities and administra@@ tions .
this harmonisation and cooperation will gener@@ ate the degree of confidence between Member States required for the effective application of the country of origin approach .
finally , a number of der@@ og@@ ations are for@@ eseen for services demonstra@@ ting a particular sens@@ iti@@ vity because of the need to protect consumers , public health or public security , or where the current di@@ ver@@ g@@ ence of Member States &apos; legislation does not allow the application of the country of origin approach .
as pointed out in my earlier reply , the Commission is conf@@ ident that the proposal is the best way to allow the economic potential of the services sector to materi@@ alise , in the interest of our workers , our consumers and our companies .
I also wish to welcome Commissioner Mc@@ C@@ re@@ ev@@ y to his first Ques@@ tion T@@ ime in Parliament and to re @-@ emphasise at the out@@ set that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy and objectives because they can create greater we@@ alth and employment within the European Union .
however , turning to his reply , one of the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est h@@ ind@@ ran@@ ces to cross @-@ border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one @-@ stop sho@@ p for regis@@ tra@@ tion of a company , that is if one Member State ap@@ prov@@ es a company to provide that service in that Member State , it should be reci@@ proc@@ al in all other Member States , because the same basis for decision @-@ making under the internal market rules should apply .
. the country of origin approach which lies at the heart of the Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive will allow for the circumstances Mr C@@ ro@@ w@@ le@@ y has out@@ lined .
as I said in my reply , it will allow companies to operate in another Member State without having to go through a mul@@ t@@ itude of further tes@@ ts .
that is the basis of the country of origin principle as it would apply to the circumstances out@@ lined .
I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Ques@@ tion T@@ ime in this House .
I should like to ask him , in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity - aspects of the Lisbon Agenda - if he would confirm that he shar@@ es my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed , especially when Europe is compared to the United States ?
in this regard , would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the work@@ place - which is gre@@ atly restric@@ ted in the EU compared to the situation in the US , in part because of the lack of affor@@ d@@ able chil@@ d@@ care facil@@ ities - needs to be addressed ?
will the Commission address this issue ?
. I welcome Mr M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l &apos;s contribution , but would like to point out that the matters referred to come under the re@@ mit of my colleague , Mr S@@ pid@@ l@@ a .
Mr M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l has gone into further problems relating to growth within the European Community .
the Lisbon process is about addres@@ sing these matters and , as you will be aware , Mr Barroso has made the Lisbon Agenda his top priority for our period in office .
I note what the honourable Member has said regarding access by women to the labour market and his comments about chil@@ d@@ care .
I am sure other colleagues in the Commission will address these matters .
I too wish to welcome Commissioner Mc@@ C@@ re@@ ev@@ y .
when it comes to the Ser@@ vic@@ es Directive , it is clear that not everyone has understood why it is needed .
I therefore think it would be appropriate , and shall also ask the Commissioner if it might not be appropriate , to produce a list of examples clearly show@@ ing how companies have , in practical terms , been preven@@ ted from contribu@@ ting to economic development .
one example is the case of a French company that wishes to produce gra@@ ves@@ ton@@ es being preven@@ ted from doing so by Ger@@ man@@ s and ex@@ posed to thre@@ ats of fin@@ es .
can the Commissioner come back with a full and practical list of the h@@ ost of problems we have seen in S@@ O@@ L@@ V@@ I@@ T and in other con@@ texts - problems to which companies are ex@@ posed and that prevent economic development ?
. we have produced such a document and I shall gla@@ dly send a c@@ op@@ y of it to the honourable Member .
Madam President , I know how hard it is to cha@@ ir these s@@ es@@ sions , but I wonder what rele@@ van@@ ce that suppl@@ ementary had to Mr M@@ it@@ ch@@ el@@ l &apos;s original question ?
Mrs C@@ eder@@ sch@@ i@@ ö@@ ld seem@@ ed to have ju@@ mp@@ ed back to the previous question .
I know my colleague Mr De R@@ ossa had a genuine suppl@@ ementary on the previous question and was ref@@ used the floor !
Mr Mar@@ tin , it is ev@@ ident that the whole House takes a great deal of interest in this matter .
a great many Members had asked to speak , and there is no way for me to know in advan@@ ce what Members &quot; suppl@@ ementary questions will rela@@ te to when I give them the floor .
perhaps you should discuss the matter again with Mrs C@@ eder@@ sch@@ i@@ ö@@ ld .
the second part of Ques@@ tion T@@ ime has already over@@ run in any case , which means that Ques@@ tions Nos 31 to 33 can no longer be taken , and will instead be answ@@ ered in wr@@ iting .
we shall now proceed to the next set of questions .
the Summit of I@@ ber@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Heads of State or Government agreed in S@@ an J@@ os@@ é de C@@ osta R@@ ic@@ a last November to focus on encouraging education programmes , as the key to Latin American development .
does this also provide the Commission with a w@@ in@@ dow of opportunity in the field of EU @-@ Latin American relations ?
. Madam President , I must ad@@ mit that this is my first Ques@@ tion T@@ ime , but I am looking forward to it .
an opportunity to deal with specific issues should always be welcomed .
I shall now speak in Eng@@ lis@@ h .
this was a question on education , which is indeed a very important sector in the framework of the Commission &apos;s relations with Latin America .
the importance of this sector has been stres@@ sed by the Heads of State and Government of both regions in Ri@@ o , in Mad@@ rid , in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ar@@ a and at various different sum@@ m@@ its , calling in particular for the reinfor@@ cement of regional cooperation at the level of higher education .
the Commission is currently implementing cooperation programmes at national , sub@@ regional and regional levels in the field of education worth about EUR 3@@ 00 million .
in particular the Commission is financing two regional programmes in the field of higher education .
one is the Al@@ f@@ a programme - , and the other is the Al@@ ban programme - .
the Al@@ f@@ a programme promo@@ tes cooperation between higher education institutions and other relevant organisations in the two regions with a view to human and institutional capacity @-@ building , mo@@ bil@@ ising the civil society of both the EU and Latin America regions as a whole and therefore creating and reinfor@@ cing las@@ ting b@@ on@@ ds .
Al@@ f@@ a 1 cover@@ s the period 199@@ 4 @-@ 1999 and Al@@ f@@ a 2 the period 2000 @-@ 2005 .
concerning alloc@@ ations , Al@@ f@@ a 1 has a budget of EUR 32 million and Al@@ f@@ a 2 a budget of EUR 42 million .
the Al@@ ban programme was laun@@ ched in 2002 at the EU @-@ Latin America Mad@@ rid summit , thereby respon@@ ding to the recommendations of the Ri@@ o de J@@ an@@ e@@ ir@@ o summit .
the programme a@@ wards sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ships to Latin American nationals for education training at mas@@ ter and do@@ c@@ tor@@ ate levels in institutions in the EU , as well as for higher training for profession@@ als from Latin America in organisations in the Union .
at regional and national level , several education projects are being implemented , no@@ tably in basic education .
it is worth no@@ ting that the EUR 7@@ 4@@ .@@ 6 million programme is de@@ dic@@ ated to education in the context of the programme for reconstruction and re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation in Central America following H@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch in 1998 .
in N@@ ic@@ ar@@ ag@@ ua the Commission is contribu@@ ting to the improvement of the education sector through budget support tota@@ lling EUR 6@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 million .
Madam President , I would like first of all to welcome the Commissioner , Mrs F@@ er@@ r@@ ero , who , as well as having an adopted H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic sur@@ name , has a mas@@ ter@@ y of Spanish and is know@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able about Latin America .
her reply has satisfied me .
she has told me what I wanted to know about the Commission &apos;s support for the education programmes and , in particular , for the instrument I referred to in my question , the Summit of I@@ ber@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Heads of State or Government , which is made up of the Span@@ is@@ h@@ - and Portuguese @-@ speaking countries of Latin America , as well as Spain and Portugal .
I thank you once again , Commissioner .
we will have the opportunity to discuss these issues further in the future .
. since the answer has already been given , I have nothing to add .
in its campaign entitled &apos; W@@ ou@@ ld you leave it to chance ? - W@@ e d@@ on &apos;@@ t &apos; the Commission is sen@@ ding out the message that Europe has a substantial amount of money available for development cooperation .
the statement by Commissioner F@@ er@@ r@@ ero @-@ W@@ al@@ d@@ ner in this campaign says that the world must become a better place , but this ev@@ id@@ ently means primarily for Europeans and that development cooperation must in the first instance bring stability to our &apos; immediate neighbour@@ ho@@ od &apos; .
combating poverty has been re@@ leg@@ ated to a secon@@ d@@ ary role .
can the Commission say whether this approach , which is primarily designed to make Europe more secure rather than providing permanent solutions to third world development , is compatible with the development agenda of the developing countries and consistent with Article 17@@ 7 of the Treaty and the UN M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um goals ?
.
as the Commission pointed out when it laun@@ ched the pos@@ ter campaign , the priorities of European Commission development cooperation are : to reduce and even@@ tually er@@ ad@@ icate poverty ; promote sustainable development ; build democra@@ cies ; contribute to the integration of developing countries into the world economy ; support good governance and promote respect for human rights .
the Commission is committed to helping developing countries achieve the development goals of the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um .
however , there are important objectives and activities that go far beyond the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um development goals .
for example , promoting peace and security and also supporting institution building .
a comprehensive , integrated approach is therefore essential in achieving sustainable development , as made clear also by the Treaty on European Union in Article 3 , which emphas@@ ises the importance of as@@ suring consisten@@ cy of external policies and instruments in the context of external relations , security , development , economic and trade policy .
this is also clearly stres@@ sed in the 2004 annual report on the Community &apos;s development policy .
the Community &apos;s external actions , including assistance , are further adap@@ ted to the diversity of our part@@ ner regions and countries .
the European neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy is an expression of such a comprehensive and integrated part@@ ner strategy .
si@@ mil@@ arly , our relations with the larg@@ er developing countries in Asia and Latin America in particular cover a broad range of objectives .
in this context , it is clear that bringing concrete benefits to our partners will make the world a better place , not only for the people directly benef@@ iting from EC assistance but also for European citizens .
however , this does not change the over@@ rid@@ ing objective of the development policy of the European Commission , that is to er@@ ad@@ icate poverty .
Madam President , I am pleased with the Commissioner &apos;s response , because I have to say that I was a little sho@@ c@@ ked when I read her statement of 2 December .
indeed , one could have been for@@ given for thinking that the objectives that she lis@@ ted did not agree with the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives .
Commissioner , this issue has been discussed in the Committee on Bud@@ getary Con@@ tro@@ l before .
in this respect too , you have enc@@ ro@@ ac@@ hed upon the area of development cooperation .
Mr M@@ ic@@ he@@ l is the Commissioner for Development and I think that good agreements will need to be made , also in terms of statements made , to prevent what you said from being mis@@ interpre@@ ted in the broad@@ er context of the mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um objectives .
I should like to ask you to consul@@ t with Mr M@@ ic@@ he@@ l very carefully on this sc@@ or@@ e .
.
thank you for acknowled@@ ging that this campaign is going to the right development goals .
it under@@ lines the key sectors of the external assistance policy , as defined in the development policy communication and in the development goals .
there are se@@ ven elements to the se@@ ven priorities of the European Commission intervention .
one is prosperity , achieved by trade and the private sector .
second , security , which is being achieved via justice and regional cooperation .
third is freedom , achieved by human rights and good governance .
four@@ th is food : food security and rural development .
fif@@ th , water : the water initiative protecting sustainable development .
S@@ i@@ x@@ th , education : education systems and access to scho@@ ols .
lastly , the Europe@@ A@@ id message - &apos; part@@ ner@@ ships improving lives wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide &apos; - e@@ vo@@ kes the how and why of external assistance .
with regard to scope , the campaign is reaching out to over 1@@ 50 countries wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide .
it is establishing long @-@ term part@@ ner@@ ships , and its approach is to focus on ow@@ nership of projects in part@@ ner countries .
priority areas results are also to be foc@@ used upon : there must be a demonstra@@ ble impact on people &apos;s lives .
this campaign has really gone to the heart of what we want to do and comes under the u@@ mb@@ re@@ lla of the overall goals .
in the light of Israel &apos;s continued bre@@ ach of the EU @-@ Israel Pro@@ to@@ c@@ ols , will the Commission consider the sus@@ pension of these agreements ?
the human rights clause in the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement places &apos; economic freedom and the principles of the United Nations Charter , particularly the obser@@ van@@ ce of human rights and democracy &quot; as &apos; the very basis of the Association . &quot;
Article 2 , the O@@ per@@ ative C@@ la@@ use , clearly states that &apos; relations between the Par@@ ties , as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself , shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles , which guid@@ es their internal and international policy and constitu@@ tes an essential element of this Agreement . &quot;
.
in response to your call for the sus@@ pension of the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement , it is the Commission &apos;s judg@@ ement that measures such as sanctions would make the Israeli authorities less , rather than more , respon@@ sive to the efforts of the international community to promote a las@@ ting solution .
this is at a time when the EU is seeking to have a very constructive role in ensuring that the with@@ dra@@ w@@ al from G@@ az@@ a takes place in a positive climate , in cooperation with a new , and now democra@@ tically @-@ elected , Palestinian lead@@ ership .
I fully recognise the f@@ r@@ ustra@@ tions of those seeking to promote the peace process when conf@@ ron@@ ted by Israel &apos;s ex@@ pan@@ sion of its sett@@ l@@ ement activities .
the European Commission has reg@@ ularly expressed its concerns not only at the continuing terrorism and violence but also at the rou@@ te of the separ@@ ation bar@@ ri@@ er and the ex@@ pan@@ sion of sett@@ lem@@ ents .
our wish is to address these issues through dialogue .
the Commission is seeking to develop relations with Israel and the Palestin@@ ians through the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy , through support for Palestinian reforms and the development of political dialogue with Israel .
the action plan adopted for Israel includes measures to strengthen dialogue and cooperation on the importance of ad@@ her@@ ence to international law and the need to preser@@ ve the perspective of a vi@@ able , comprehensive sett@@ l@@ ement , which involves minim@@ ising the impact of security and counter @-@ terrorism measures on the civil@@ ian population .
it is the Commission &apos;s view - and I believe this is shared by the Member States - that measures to suspen@@ d the EU @-@ Israel Association Agreement would therefore be coun@@ ter@@ productive .
I fully accept what the Commissioner says about the changing circumstances .
since I tabled this question , Mr A@@ b@@ b@@ as has been elected as lead@@ er of the Palestin@@ ians and we have seen Mr Per@@ es join the Israeli Government .
that gives us some hope for dialogue between the two sides .
however , I would ask her , in her new role , to keep this Protocol under constan@@ t review and to keep the pressure on Israel to obser@@ ve the con@@ ten@@ ts of the Protocol .
I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m , the G@@ ol@@ an H@@ ei@@ ghts , the W@@ est Bank and the G@@ az@@ a S@@ tri@@ p .
I ask her to continue to monitor the situation to ensure that products from those areas are not labe@@ lled as &apos; products of Israel &apos; .
.
I can assure you that the Commission will certainly do that , because just before Ch@@ ris@@ t@@ mas we had such a Council meeting .
this has of course been one of the important issues in the Council so we will try to do our best to get both parties to ab@@ ide by their obligations .
on 9 December , at the time of the adoption of the initial action plans for the new European neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy , the Commissioner responsible for external relations and European neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy stated that his objective was to create a cir@@ cle of friends around the enlarged Union &apos;s borders .
of the se@@ ven countries with which the first action plans were concluded , only Ukraine directly shar@@ es ter@@ res@@ trial borders with the enlarged Union .
on the other hand , Belarus , which shar@@ es borders with three new EU Member States is , according to the Commissioner , not democratic enough to be included in the programme .
does the Commission plan to implement other internal measures to resolve the Belarus problem ?
does it intend to take account of the proposals to set up a cross @-@ cu@@ tting Community assistance programme in the field of human rights and democracy or to broad@@ c@@ ast ra@@ di@@ o or T@@ V programmes from neighbour@@ ing countries ?
are there plans to set up an EU delegation in M@@ ins@@ k or to ap@@ point an EU representative to Belarus ?
these initiatives would contribute to the building @-@ up of civil society in Belarus and to the process of democ@@ rat@@ isation , without in any way compromis@@ ing with the country &apos;s author@@ ita@@ rian regime .
.
the Commission under@@ lines that the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Pol@@ ic@@ y@@ framework is very important , and it wants to reinfor@@ ce further the relationship between the enlarged European Union and its neighbours , including Belarus .
a key principle of the &apos; R@@ ing of F@@ ri@@ ends &apos; is for@@ ging joint ow@@ nership .
the Union cannot impose its policy on anyone , but it is ready to conv@@ in@@ ce its neighbours of the benefits of the E@@ N@@ P .
the Union is offer@@ ing closer cooperation across the spec@@ tru@@ m of its relations - from political dialogue to economic integration - on the basis of commitment to common values .
this offer is , in principle , also val@@ id for Belarus .
through the E@@ N@@ P , the Union is ready to reinfor@@ ce its las@@ ting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus .
if and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place , it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the E@@ N@@ P , with all the benefits that would bring .
under current conditions , however , there can be no fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged E@@ N@@ P action plan for Belarus .
the October 2004 parliamentary elections and the referendum were important mil@@ es@@ ton@@ es for Belarus under the E@@ N@@ P , but , unfortunately , Belarus failed to achieve them .
however , there remains a clear pros@@ pect for deep@@ ening relations , including under the framework of the E@@ N@@ P , provided that fundamental reforms are carried out .
at present , a key element - and this is also an issue in EU policy towards Belarus - is to support civil society and the process of democ@@ rat@@ isation .
in addition , Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from the relevant regional , cross @-@ border and them@@ atic programmes .
the Commission is ste@@ pp@@ ing up its effort to coordin@@ ate assistance for democ@@ rat@@ isation and civil society .
moreover , the Commission is also looking - and here I want go into detail - into the possibility of supporting civil society and the democratic process in a flexible manner .
in the first place , the assistance should be operational and managed in the country concerned .
but the Commission does not exclu@@ de specific situations where a project would be implemented mainly outside Belarus .
the mod@@ alities for doing so need to be carefully considered in the light of the relevant rules and regulations .
support for independent media and information dis@@ sem@@ ination is among the key priorities of EU assistance .
a ra@@ di@@ o or television sta@@ tion broad@@ c@@ as@@ ting to Belarus outside the country is an interesting idea , but requires further clari@@ fication as to whether such an initiative could be supported by EU funds under the existing rules and regulations .
as to the question of opening a delegation in Belarus , it must be bor@@ ne in mind that the EU has limited resources for exten@@ ding its network of fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged dele@@ gations .
Belarus is covered by the European Commission delegation in K@@ i@@ e@@ v , which has a technical assistance office in M@@ ins@@ k .
the Commission will look into the pos@@ sibilities of alloc@@ ating , within the existing structures , additional human resources for work in Belarus .
at the moment , opening a European Commission delegation in M@@ ins@@ k is not , however , being considered .
Commissioner , I should also like to congratulate you on your first Ques@@ tion T@@ ime .
your detailed re@@ p@@ lies would seem to indic@@ ate that the Commission will in fact be working very actively in Belarus .
I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belar@@ us@@ sian authorities to be possible , even in the present circumstances ?
. Madam President , there can be no question of us co@@ operating with the authorities at present .
what we can do , however , and as I mentioned before , is to provide particular support for civil society , and also to focus efforts on working with the ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic community .
I can tell you that we are planning to hold three wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s in order to identi@@ fy exactly what we can do , involving non @-@ governmental organisations and as many neighbour@@ ing countries as possible , as we share the view that support for civil society is the only opportunity available to us at present to bring about change in Belarus .
many thanks .
Commissioner , it would seem that it is indeed essential to involve Belarus &apos;s neighbours in efforts to support the development of civil society in that country .
ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic programmes and programmes relating to the independent media can only be implemented with the cooperation of neighbour@@ ing countries .
I believe that finding projects that might lead to additional funding for such measures would be the best way of ensuring that in future we will be able to establish cooperation with a genuine democratic government in Belarus .
.
first I should like to point out that I have already answ@@ ered , in principle , the question of the media .
I clearly pointed out the Commission &apos;s opinion for the time being .
however , with regard to projects and money I can give you some examples : the EU &apos;s support for civil society is to be strength@@ ened ; the EU &apos;s T@@ AC@@ I@@ S programme - which amounts to EUR 10 million for Belarus in 2005 and 2006 - will focus on support for civil society , independent media - exactly what you wanted us to focus on ; higher education cooperation including ex@@ changes of stud@@ ents and prof@@ ess@@ ors ; and alle@@ vi@@ ation of the consequences of the C@@ her@@ no@@ by@@ l ca@@ tastro@@ p@@ he .
the provision of information to the general public with regard to the European Union and the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy will also be strength@@ ened .
in addition , the T@@ em@@ pu@@ s Programme will finance ex@@ changes of young Belar@@ u@@ sian uni@@ versity stud@@ ents ab@@ road , curr@@ ic@@ ul@@ um development on European studies and capacity @-@ building in local univers@@ ities .
as I said , Belarus is indeed eli@@ gible under the New N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od programmes .
it will therefore benefit from the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy instrument as of 2007 .
finally , the European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights - the E@@ ID@@ H@@ R - will have a more active role in Belarus in the years to come .
in 2005 @-@ 2006 Belar@@ u@@ sian applic@@ ants will be able to apply for support under two campa@@ ig@@ ns : &apos; fos@@ tering a culture of human rights &apos; and &apos; promoting democratic processes &apos; .
I should like to know whether the European Commission is aware that these much @-@ needed edu@@ ca@@ tional programmes are under the control of the Belar@@ us@@ sian authorities , and therefore cannot be regar@@ ded as true support for the process of democ@@ rat@@ isation in Belarus .
I should also like to ask whether , in the light of the Commissioner &apos;s comments , a su@@ m of money will be ear@@ mar@@ ked under the E@@ ID@@ H@@ R ( European In@@ iti@@ ative for Democ@@ racy and Human Rights ) programme to support independent initiatives in Belarus , be@@ aring in mind that over recent years not a single euro from the fund has yet been set asi@@ de for this purpose .
.
as I said before , we will have three wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s .
the last of them will be in Li@@ thu@@ ania , which invi@@ ted the Commission to work together with some neighbour@@ ing countries on new ideas and strateg@@ ies ; on what can be done with NGOs and others .
I will certainly take up this sugges@@ tion in those wor@@ ks@@ hop@@ s to see what can be done , but it must f@@ it into the framework of the regulations that are there .
however , we will certainly consider that .
questions Nos 38 to 41 will be answ@@ ered in wr@@ iting .
questions Nos 39 and 40 lap@@ se , as they are already on the agenda for this part @-@ session .
ar@@ tic@@ les appe@@ aring in the highly re@@ pu@@ table &apos; V@@ im@@ a &apos; new@@ s@@ paper of 5 and 7 December 2004 re@@ ve@@ al the dis@@ co@@ very of a tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one ta@@ pp@@ ing network set up by the Italian authorities and used to e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ p on mo@@ b@@ ile and fi@@ xed tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tions by Greek citizens in Greece .
this has been confirmed in a report produced by the Public Pro@@ secu@@ tor &apos;s Office in Bar@@ i ( Italy ) and quo@@ ted by the new@@ s@@ paper .
it emer@@ ges that the network was set up without any court order having been issu@@ ed by the Greek authorities , while sen@@ i@@ or Greek police and fraud s@@ qu@@ ad offic@@ ers indic@@ ate that they were ti@@ pped off once the network had already been set up by Italian func@@ tion@@ aries .
will the Commission request information from the Italian and Greek authorities on this matter ?
does it know whether any form of compla@@ int has been regis@@ tered to date by the Greek authorities at the e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pp@@ ing by the Italian authorities on Greek citizens without a court order ?
is it ad@@ mis@@ sible , in the abs@@ ence of a court order by a Member State , for tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one conver@@ sa@@ tions by citizens of that Member State to be mon@@ ito@@ red by the authorities of another Member State ?
. the Commission has not been informed of any de@@ position by the Greek authorities concerning any of the facts mentioned by the honourable Member .
since ph@@ one ta@@ ps always require an assessment of the propor@@ tion@@ ality of the potential inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ement of fundamental rights in relation to the public interest ser@@ ved by such measures , per@@ mit@@ ting ph@@ one ta@@ ps as a means of conduc@@ ting criminal investi@@ gations are in most cases subject to a court war@@ r@@ ant .
when the competent authorities of one Member State in the course of criminal investi@@ gations in their own country need to carry out ta@@ ps on p@@ hon@@ es or tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ication services loc@@ ated in another Member State they must follow the procedures that have been put in place for that purpose .
the European Commission obviously does not have the means to jud@@ ge the behaviour of independent judicial authorities .
the main European instrument providing for this situation is the 2000 Convention on M@@ u@@ tu@@ al As@@ sis@@ tance in C@@ r@@ imin@@ al M@@ at@@ ters between the Member States of the European Union .
until such time as this Convention en@@ ters into force , Member States can have rec@@ our@@ se to the 19@@ 5@@ 9 Council of Europe Convention on M@@ u@@ tu@@ al As@@ sis@@ tance in C@@ r@@ imin@@ al M@@ at@@ ters and to Council of Europe R@@ ec@@ om@@ mend@@ ation ( 8@@ 5 ) 10 concerning let@@ ters ro@@ g@@ atory for the inter@@ c@@ ep@@ tion of tel@@ ec@@ om@@ mun@@ ications .
Madam President , Commissioner , I welcome you but you surpris@@ e me .
it is in@@ comprehen@@ sible that the Commission should avoid commen@@ ting on a serious inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ement of the basic rules of data protection .
we have had tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one ta@@ pp@@ ing in Greece of Greek citizens by the Italian authorities in the abs@@ ence of any Greek authorities .
Commissioner , a few weeks ago you were a minis@@ ter in the Italian Government .
why can you not pic@@ k up the tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one and ask both the Italian and the Greek Government what happened ?
. I would like to a@@ pol@@ og@@ ise to Mr Pa@@ pa@@ d@@ im@@ ou@@ l@@ is , but I can only repeat that the Commission has not received any information about this case .
at any rate , the Commission does not have the legal right to rule on a bre@@ ach which , if committed , would have been committed by an independent judicial authority and not by a governmental authority of a Member State .
there are legal instruments available , which I pointed out : in particular , Council of Europe recommendations and the Council of Europe &apos;s Convention on M@@ u@@ tu@@ al As@@ sis@@ tance .
- Madam President , Commissioner , I think there has been another mis@@ take here or something has es@@ cap@@ ed you .
last December , the and new@@ s@@ paper@@ s re@@ ported exten@@ sively on tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one ta@@ pp@@ ing ; they even had special di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms of a de@@ vice which per@@ pet@@ rates this crime , in or out of in@@ ver@@ ted com@@ mas .
this de@@ vice exists some@@ where in M@@ il@@ an or sou@@ thern Italy .
I wonder , therefore , how is it that you too have not yet found out about it , so that you can make the relevant obser@@ vations today .
. of course , what Mr M@@ av@@ ro@@ m@@ ma@@ ti@@ s said is correct .
the Italian new@@ s@@ paper@@ s have re@@ ported certain facts ; nevertheless the Commission can and must remain within the scope of its legal powers , which do not include the power to subject the behaviour of judicial authorities to investi@@ gations or actions .
there are instruments , including within the national states , which allow a jud@@ ge who has carried out an illegal activity to be prosecu@@ ted , but that clearly cannot happen at the request of the Commission .
Commissioner , regar@@ d@@ less of the facts of this case , when you next meet the justice ministers , will you make it clear to them that , under the various international conven@@ tions you mention and in the spirit of membership of the European Union , it is unacceptable for the authorities of one Member State - be they political or judicial - to carry out ph@@ one ta@@ pp@@ ing in another Member State , without the express approval of that Member State ?
. Mr Mar@@ tin , you are absolutely correct and this is certainly the right path to take .
as you are probably aware , in Italy it fall@@ s on the one hand to the Minister for Justice and , on the other , to the judic@@ i@@ ary &apos;s self @-@ govern@@ ing body to take action against jud@@ ges who com@@ mit illegal acts .
I have naturally passed this request on to the Italian Minister for Justice .
what is the Commission &apos;s view on reac@@ tions to the Commission &apos;s annual report on Mi@@ gration ( July 2004 ) , including the view of experts such as S@@ O@@ L@@ ID@@ A@@ R ( K@@ at@@ r@@ in Hu@@ gen@@ du@@ be@@ l ) and the Social P@@ la@@ t@@ form of NGOs that it is difficult to establish &apos; best practice &apos; on integration policy when the con@@ texts of each EU Member State are so different ?
. it is certainly true that there are different appro@@ ac@@ hes to integration represented in the Member States .
concept and practice var@@ ies due to a number of factors : different immigration histor@@ ies and vari@@ ations in the ro@@ les of government and civil society with respect to integration policies are just two examples .
the Commission consisten@@ tly stres@@ sed that integration policy was by definition an area where subsidiarity is at sta@@ ke .
on the other hand , all Member States ad@@ here to human rights standards and shared values such as equality anti @-@ discrimination , solidarity , toler@@ ance , et@@ c .@@ .
through the ongoing exchange of information and experience , particularly through the work of national contact points for integration , we are now seeing a certain degree of conver@@ g@@ ence with respect to policy appro@@ ac@@ hes , goals and targets .
this was confirmed in December with the adoption by the Council of common basic principles on integration .
the pub@@ l@@ ication by the Commission in November 2004 of a hand@@ bo@@ o@@ k on integration for policy ma@@ kers and prac@@ t@@ iti@@ oners , which brings together examples of good practice from throughout the Union on introduction programmes , ci@@ vi@@ c participation and integration indic@@ ators , ill@@ ustra@@ tes that there are many common problems and shows how much we can learn from each other .
best practice must be taken for what it is : ideas , less@@ ons to be lear@@ ned and sugges@@ tions which can ins@@ p@@ ire and inform policy ma@@ kers in the definition of the policies required .
I thank the Commissioner for that clear answer .
I know from the previous debate that you take the issue of integration seriously .
the Commission has a real impact on integration policy and a direct role , for example , in the en@@ for@@ cement of existing directives , which are crucial to integration - I refer expl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly to the Employment Directive and the R@@ ace E@@ quality Directive .
the Commission has played a strong role in trying to en@@ force these directives .
they remain un@@ implemented in at least two Member States that I am aware of .
will you use your powers in office to en@@ force such directives , which play such an important part in the integration process ?
you have that power .
. yes , of course the Commission has such power , and I can reas@@ sure you that the Commission will use all its power to guarantee , sti@@ mu@@ late and encourage Member States to fully implement all directives in the common European interest .
Commissioner , I shall speak in your mo@@ ther ton@@ gue in order to be for@@ th@@ right with regard to an old question : illegal immigration .
the lan@@ dings of illegal immigrants will certainly not wait for us to come up with a common strategy before they resu@@ me in the Mediterranean .
certainly , the only reason they are not continuing at the moment as well is because the poor w@@ ret@@ ches are lying on the se@@ ab@@ ed .
so I would like to ask , what is the Commission doing and what has been planned for the ne@@ ar future to help countries on the borders of the European Union - I am referring in particular to my country , M@@ alta - in order to provide aid and to receive illegal immigrants in a proper manner ?
what level of funding will be allocated for this ?
. the question of illegal immigration is one which the Commission considers to be a priority .
while we are preparing political actions and common European solutions , as you pointed out , we must also address the daily trag@@ edy of des@@ per@@ ate people .
the Commission can and must take action , and it will , in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of persons enter@@ ing European territory are respected , obviously including those who enter ille@@ g@@ ally : the right to respect for human life and dignity is not a question of legal differences .
having said that , we must speed up the strategic policies .
we cannot take advantage of a delay and thereby continue to allow an illegal influ@@ x , but we must immediately respect the fundamental rights of individuals and at the same time prepare common policies on rec@@ ep@@ tion , on the one hand , and the prevention of illegal activities , on the other .
in the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the fight against terrorism , the Member States were required to pass legislation in a number of areas related to combating terrorism , with a view to establishing common defin@@ itions in the face of the thre@@ ats in question .
Article 11 of this framework decision called on the Commission and Council to make an assessment by the end of 2003 of the forms of implementation by the Member States of specific anti @-@ terrorism measures .
these texts were finally submitted by the Commission ( 8 June 2004 - COM ( 2004 ) 04@@ 0@@ 9 / final ) and the Council ( 12 October 2004 - 1@@ 16@@ 8@@ 7 / 2 / 0@@ 4 / re@@ v@@ .@@ 2 ) .
both reports stress , in clear and objective fas@@ hi@@ on , the pas@@ si@@ vity of the Member States and their failure to comply with the objectives set out in the Council framework decision .
the Commission does not pos@@ s@@ ess binding legal instruments to obli@@ ge the Member States to comply with framework decisions .
despite this and with a view to ensuring the EU &apos;s credibility in the fight against terrorism , can the Commission state how it intends to promote and obtain a genuine anti @-@ terrorist policy at Union level and ensure that the Member States act on their promis@@ es regarding legislative action ?
. according to Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union , framework decisions are binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods .
however , framework decisions &apos; shall not enta@@ il direct effect &apos; .
where@@ as , within the first pillar , the Commission has the authority to initi@@ ate an inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ement procedure against a Member State , this possibility does not exist within the Treaty on European Union .
the situation described by the honourable Member certainly does not facilitate the Commission &apos;s role , but it does not prevent it from producing a broad range of policy initiatives , which have been the basis for the policy definition of the Union in the important area of the fight against terrorism .
the Commission has been playing this role very actively in establishing in June 2004 the revis@@ ed action plan on combating terrorism , in up@@ d@@ ating it in December 2004 and in implementing more than half of the respec@@ tive measures .
this is also ev@@ ident from the sub@@ mission , in October 2004 , of four commun@@ ications cover@@ ing different aspects of the prevention , prepar@@ ed@@ ness and response to terrorist attacks and from the adoption , in the same year , of a communication on mutual access to data relevant to the fight against terrorism and of several classi@@ fied documents in the field of consequ@@ ence management and the protection of critical infrastruc@@ tures .
the Commission in general and President Barroso and I in particular are determined to work in close cooperation with Council presid@@ encies to maintain the fight against terrorism .
this is very high on the agenda of the Council , including that of the J@@ H@@ A Council and the European Council comp@@ ris@@ ing the Heads of State and Government .
I am well aware of the legal framework in which the European anti @-@ terrorism policy can operate as far as the Commission is concerned and you described it very well .
if , however , we do not wish to demonstrate collective hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , we need to say how things stand .
and the way they stand is that we have major con@@ fer@@ ences , with all the Heads of Government present , and after@@ wards they have a press conference , set out a decision and following this decision nothing happens .
the Commission itself ad@@ mitted as much on 8 June 2004 .
the question is , therefore : what is the Commission going to do in political terms to put the policy into practice ?
. the Commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implementation of the H@@ ag@@ ue Programme at the infor@@ mal meeting of the Ministers for Internal Affairs and for Justice at the end of the month .
the action plan will be presented in May this year and I hope that it will be adopted by the European Council in June .
the action plan on combating terrorism will contain tan@@ gible measures and guidelines , precise dead@@ lines for the Member States and binding obligations for a common policy to enhan@@ ce cooperation , information exchange and protection for the victims of terrorist attacks .
these are the measures that the Commission initi@@ ally intends to put before Parliament , something which we shall do at the beginning of February , that is , well before we draw up our proposal , and we shall then lis@@ ten to Parliament &apos;s opinion on the concrete proposals .
what progress is the Commission making towards proposing a standar@@ dis@@ ed set of criteria for the re@@ porting of crimes and collec@@ tion of statistics about crimes across the European Union ?
until such a system is established , it is difficult for law en@@ for@@ cement offic@@ ers to have a clear pic@@ ture of the extent of organised criminal activity , and it is therefore very difficult to counter the gan@@ gs effectively .
. the Commission agre@@ es that the abs@@ ence of compar@@ able crime statistics makes the development of an effective EU law en@@ for@@ cement policy more difficult .
the Commission is working on a draft action plan on EU crime statistics .
Member State crime statistics experts are being consul@@ ted on this draft action plan , which will be presented in the form of a Commission communication in the s@@ pring of 2005 .
the two main b@@ loc@@ ks of the draft action plan are : first , the setting up of appropriate coordination ma@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y to ensure that Member States , the Commission and other key ac@@ tors are part of the process of working towards common data @-@ ga@@ ther@@ ing methods and harmon@@ ised definition ; the second element concerns the implementation of developing compar@@ able statistics .
this will include many different com@@ pon@@ ents , to be developed over a period of time , such as defin@@ itions of crime types and an inv@@ ent@@ ory of defin@@ itions where there is already EU @-@ level agreement .
the Commission , in close cooperation with Europol and other provid@@ ers and users of EU crime statistics , is developing this project on a step @-@ by @-@ step basis in accordance with Member States &apos; ability to provide relevant data .
the Commission &apos;s draft action plan was discussed with European direc@@ tors of social statistics in September 2004 .
it was agreed to set up a task force to examine appropriate statis@@ tical methods for monitoring crime .
this task force will begin its work in May 2005 .
I should also mention that the Commission is providing support for work being undertaken to measure statis@@ tically the quality and effectiveness of the judicial process .
a sem@@ in@@ ar on this subject , co @-@ finan@@ ced by the EU &apos;s A@@ G@@ I@@ S Programme , was h@@ os@@ ted by the Italian Minis@@ try of Justice in R@@ ome in October 2004 .
thank you , Commissioner , for sta@@ ying to answer the question .
I am very grateful that you recognise the urgency of this problem because with open borders across the Union , organised crime is free to operate and to pros@@ per , while our police forces are national and cannot cross the fron@@ ti@@ ers .
so we have a real problem .
I am glad that you are tre@@ ating this with considerable urgency .
could you tell us who will be responsible for the coordin@@ ating ma@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y ?
will this be done by Europol or will it be done by the Commission - or ma@@ y@@ be a new agency ?
. I do not think that we can or should create new bodies ; I think that on the one hand the Commission should give strategic , or rather political direction to this sector and , on the other hand , the sector should have the chance to find different ways to use Europol , which as we all know is trying to extend its du@@ ties and its re@@ mit .
the Commission intends to encourage this prog@@ res@@ sion , this ex@@ pan@@ sion of Europol &apos;s du@@ ties .
this is un@@ doub@@ tedly one of the sectors where work can be done .
Madam President , I would like to make a few remarks : some of my fellow Members , like myself , have been here since the start of the sitting , have submitted written questions and have not had the opportunity of receiv@@ ing a reply in the Chamber which they could then counter with a further question , whether they were satisfied or not .
the B@@ ure@@ au and the legal de@@ part@@ ments should better consider the matter of Ques@@ tion T@@ ime and give proper thought as to the time all@@ ot@@ ted and how many questions can be answ@@ ered in that time , because we cannot obli@@ ge a Member to sta@@ y in the Chamber all this time and then not have the satisfac@@ tion of receiv@@ ing an immediate , direct reply from the competent Commissioner .
the situation deser@@ ves to be loo@@ ked into by Parliament &apos;s administration .
it is absolutely in@@ toler@@ able for a situation of this kind to ar@@ ise .
Mrs S@@ bar@@ b@@ at@@ i , the Rules of Procedure la@@ y down quite clear rules for the holding of Ques@@ tion T@@ ime .
a great many Members asked to speak on a certain to@@ pic earlier , and I could not give the floor to everyone .
in my opinion , the main problem is that many Members spen@@ d a long time asking suppl@@ ementary questions , and do not ab@@ ide by the 30 @-@ second time limit , which of course means that we are often dela@@ yed .
I will , however , bear your comments in mind .
I should like to extend my sinc@@ ere thanks to everyone , and especially to Commissioner F@@ rat@@ tin@@ i again for being prepared to remain so long in the Chamber with us for Ques@@ tion T@@ ime .
questions Nos 4@@ 6 to 7@@ 6 will be answ@@ ered in wr@@ iting .
Mr President , I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure .
we saw this House spi@@ ed on in a dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful manner during the last election period , and it appears that this is already happening again , in that I heard yesterday that at least one atten@@ d@@ ance list from December 2004 was given - I stress given - to a Member in order that he might make a c@@ op@@ y of it .
there are two questions I would like to ask about this .
firstly , is there any basis in fact for what I have been told ?
secondly , if there is , is there any basis in law for this being done ?
I am not sure whether this is exactly a point of order , but , in any event , I can reply by saying that the B@@ ure@@ au has already loo@@ ked into this issue , which has been commun@@ icated to the legal services , and we are a@@ waiting a report from those services so that we can act accord@@ ingly .
the next item is the Council Sta@@ te@@ ment on the programme of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , Prime Minister of Luxemb@@ our@@ g , has the floor , and I would like once again to express Parliament &apos;s sa@@ d@@ ness at the death of her Ro@@ y@@ al Hi@@ gh@@ ness , the G@@ r@@ and Du@@ ch@@ ess J@@ os@@ ep@@ h@@ ine @-@ Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te of Luxemb@@ our@@ g , P@@ r@@ inc@@ ess of Belgi@@ um .
.
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must say , it is always a ple@@ asure to come to Strasbourg , the very emb@@ od@@ im@@ ent of the European c@@ ity , a c@@ ity that symb@@ olis@@ es the re@@ conciliation between France and Germany , a meeting point for so many European amb@@ itions and an inter@@ sec@@ tion of so many contin@@ en@@ tal dre@@ am@@ s .
in addition to my ple@@ asure at being here , I have the hon@@ our today to present to Parliament - the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe - the priorities for the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency of the European Union . the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency follows that of our Dutch friends .
I must pay hear@@ t@@ felt tribu@@ te to their hard work , their ten@@ ac@@ ity and their un@@ den@@ i@@ able succ@@ esses .
the EU made significant progress under the Dutch Presidency .
when it comes to an end , I hope to be able to say the same of the el@@ ev@@ ent@@ h Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , which beg@@ an a few days ago .
the experience of our previous presid@@ encies might indeed prove to be valuable , but presid@@ encies come and go and have different character@@ is@@ tics .
when I was President of the Council of Ministers for the first time , in 198@@ 5 , there were ten Members of the European Commun@@ ities ; when I was President in 199@@ 1 , there were 12 ministers around the table ; when I took over the Presidency in 1997 , there were fif@@ teen of us , and now there are 25 Member States .
in 20 years the number of Member States has more than doub@@ led .
the decision @-@ making system has naturally become more compl@@ icated .
what a jo@@ y and a ple@@ asure , however , to see the countries of E@@ as@@ tern and Central Europe take their place in the EU , in view of the fa@@ te@@ ful dec@@ re@@ e that s@@ ought to dri@@ ve a w@@ ed@@ ge between us for ever .
the experience of our various presid@@ encies and of obser@@ ving the succ@@ es@@ sive presid@@ encies of other countries has tau@@ ght me two things .
firstly , the EU will not genuinely move forward if those holding the Presidency place their own national interests at the heart of their concerns rather than re@@ pla@@ cing them with the common interest , the best definition of the interests of everyone .
it follows that the EU will not find genuine coher@@ ence , let alone harmon@@ y , unless we all respect the spirit and the letter of the Community method and the balance between the three institutions .
the Commission is not a tou@@ ch jud@@ ge sol@@ ely in charge of monitoring compliance with the rules of the internal market .
it should be the pla@@ y@@ ma@@ ker , the ins@@ pi@@ ration and the dri@@ ving force of the te@@ am .
the Council , for its part , is not the field of play of exclu@@ sively national interests , however justified those may be , but rather a wor@@ ks@@ ho@@ p of understanding .
the place of Parliament , for its part , is not that of a spec@@ ta@@ tor w@@ at@@ ching from the stands .
it is an ac@@ tor with pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ged status because it is legitim@@ ised by univers@@ al su@@ ff@@ ra@@ ge .
you will , therefore , see me reg@@ ularly in your offic@@ es , in your meetings and in your cor@@ rid@@ ors in Brussels and Strasbourg .
I say this for myself , for my ministers and for all those who work in the service of Parliament , and thus in your service .
together we must over@@ see the ratification of the new Constitutional Treaty in the right conditions .
it is true that the draft Constitution is not perfec@@ t , but we must not ben@@ ch@@ mark it against perfec@@ tion ; we must ben@@ ch@@ mark it against what Europe will need in order to remain an example to the world in the future .
let us do now what must be done in order for this to be the case in the future and let us rati@@ fy the Treaty .
let us not forget that the Treaty is a text that is of neither the left nor the right .
its content will be the fru@@ it of our con@@ vic@@ tions , of our will and of our amb@@ ition .
if our will and our amb@@ ition are perfec@@ t , the implementation of the new Treaty , which may be im@@ perfec@@ t in the@@ ory , will probably be perfectly successful in practice .
the ratification of the Treaty will not be an easy task every@@ where , and I have one major concern in this regard : let us not use the potential difficulties of the parliamentary rati@@ fications and referendu@@ ms as an exc@@ use to s@@ la@@ c@@ ken the p@@ ace of action or to avoid making decisions .
let us not put off the most difficult decisions until the day after the first referendum , then until the day after the second referendum , then until the day after the third referendum , and so on .
when we ask for the approval of the peoples and the parliaments of Europe , let us show them that Europe works , that Europe is on the move , that Europe is decisive and that Europe is capable of fulfi@@ lling its responsibilities .
if the EU takes decisive action it can w@@ in over the doub@@ ters ; if it is in@@ active it can put doub@@ ts in the min@@ ds of those pre@@ viously convinced .
Mr President , when the new Presidency takes up its du@@ ties there is us@@ u@@ ally a s@@ olem@@ n at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here , but that has been over@@ sha@@ do@@ wed this year by the terri@@ ble trag@@ edy of the se@@ a@@ qu@@ a@@ ke in South @-@ e@@ ast Asia .
the deep@@ ly dist@@ res@@ sing pic@@ tures of the de@@ ad , the in@@ ju@@ red and the de@@ vasta@@ tion c@@ ast a gi@@ ant sha@@ dow over the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005 .
this trag@@ edy will l@@ ing@@ er long in the m@@ em@@ ory and I hope that , in addition to the immediate emergency aid , we shall show las@@ ting solidarity with the de@@ vasta@@ ted peoples and regions of Asia .
I should also like us to ensure that the mis@@ er@@ y that we are seeing in Asia today does not make us turn our bac@@ ks on the poverty , the under@@ development , the hun@@ ger and the death of inno@@ cent people elsewhere .
our hear@@ ts should be in places where the television cam@@ er@@ as are no longer or have never been .
Mr President , the European security strategy encoura@@ ges us to promote peace , democracy and stability in the fight against the ro@@ ot causes of ins@@ ec@@ urity in the world .
it is absolutely crucial that , in a coherent and coordin@@ ated fas@@ hi@@ on , we use the entire range of EU instruments in the W@@ estern Balkans , in the Middle East , in our relations with Russia and Ukraine and in our transatlan@@ tic relations .
the future of the Balkans , a region still tra@@ u@@ mat@@ ised by its recent past , must form part of Europe &apos;s out@@ look .
the opening of accession negotiations with C@@ roati@@ a in March 2005 , provided that there has been confir@@ mation of complete cooperation with the C@@ r@@ imin@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al for the former Y@@ u@@ gosla@@ via , will demonstrate to all Bal@@ kan countries that their efforts towards democracy will be re@@ war@@ ded and might bear more fru@@ it .
for the other countries in the region , the EU &apos;s general action framework will continue to fall under the guidelines of the Th@@ ess@@ al@@ on@@ ik@@ i Agenda , which s@@ ets out the European perspective presented to the Bal@@ kan countries .
the Presidency will hold talks with Alban@@ ia on a sta@@ bil@@ isation and association agreement .
a further crucial mil@@ es@@ t@@ one in the region will be a review in mid @-@ 2005 of the implementation of the standards policy in Kosovo .
we shall be pa@@ ying close attention to the developing situation in Kosovo .
I am of the opinion that , whatever its status , Kosovo &apos;s future res@@ ts within the EU .
the Russian F@@ eder@@ ation is a strategic part@@ ner of the EU and remains a major factor in European security and stability .
ad@@ m@@ itte@@ dly , the state of our relations is not satisfactory at the moment .
I shall do all that I can to re@@ me@@ dy this state of affairs , whilst remain@@ ing firm on our cor@@ e demands .
I trust I can coun@@ t on your support in this endeav@@ our .
at the EU @-@ Russia Summit in M@@ os@@ co@@ w on 10 May , the Presidency will s@@ tri@@ ve for a balanced package as regards the F@@ our Common S@@ pac@@ es set out at the S@@ t Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg Summit , which are based on common values and shared interests .
the EU will for@@ ge close ties with the new President of Ukraine , not least in areas such as the implementation of the European N@@ ei@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ od Policy .
we have every interest in having a stable and prosper@@ ous Ukraine as a neigh@@ bour , a Ukraine that is strongly ro@@ o@@ ted in democracy , a Ukraine that is committed to the path of modern@@ isation .
the Presidency will prepare thorou@@ gh@@ ly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place during the United Kingdom Presidency .
I shall now turn to transatlan@@ tic relations .
for the world to be a stable place , it needs a transatlan@@ tic partnership that works .
at the moment , transatlan@@ tic relations are not bad , but nor are they particularly good .
lea@@ ving matters as they are , however , is not an option that will satis@@ fy expectations on both sides of the Atlan@@ tic .
consequently , we must improve the quality of relations in the best interests of both parties .
we shall do this at the two Sum@@ m@@ its with President Bush - the first in February , at the US President &apos;s request , and the second in June .
we shall not focus on the differences of opinion that some of us may have had with the United States in the recent past , but we shall try to put the emphasis on a series of practical questions to which we must give equally practical answ@@ ers .
transatlan@@ tic relations would not be complete without Can@@ ad@@ a , and I am delighted that there is to be a summit with Can@@ ad@@ a during my Presidency , in which we shall be discussing matters of shared importance between friends .
the same applies , on the other side of the world , to our Jap@@ an@@ ese friends .
at this point , Mr President , I should like to say a word about the Middle East .
with the election of President A@@ b@@ b@@ as on 9 January as head of the Palestinian Authority , and with the pros@@ pect of the Israeli with@@ dra@@ w@@ al from the G@@ az@@ a S@@ tri@@ p , a w@@ in@@ dow of opportunity has open@@ ed up to rela@@ un@@ ch the peace process and to speed up the implementation of the road ma@@ p .
that opportunity must now be se@@ iz@@ ed .
against this back@@ dro@@ p , I should like to offer my support to the Middle East conference due to take place in L@@ on@@ d@@ on in March 2005 .
this , I am sure , will represent an essential step towards consolid@@ ating the peace process .
under the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , the process of EU enlargement will be guid@@ ed by the decisions taken by the European Council of last December .
we shall be opening accession negotiations with Turkey in March .
as regards Bulgar@@ ia and Romania , I hope that Parliament will issue its ass@@ ent in April on the accession of those two countries , which will enable us to sign accession Treaties , also in April .
Mr President , we cannot bring the EU closer to its citizens if we remain inc@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of meeting their justi@@ fi@@ able expectations as regards internal security .
the new Constitutional Treaty pa@@ ves the way towards defin@@ iti@@ vely ab@@ olis@@ hing the &apos; Justice and Home Affairs excep@@ tion , &quot; in other words the complete integration of this field into the European Pro@@ ject by means of the ri@@ goro@@ us application of the Community method .
under our Presidency , justice and home affairs activities will be in line with this perspective , and our working basis will fall within the framework of the excellent H@@ ag@@ ue Programme , adopted by the Council in November of last year .
in order to ensure that the area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality , we must think European before we think national .
we must ensure that a European security culture is developed .
this is a particularly important requirement as regards the fight against serious and organised crime .
dri@@ ving forward the area of freedom , security and justice is in our view an essential , even exis@@ ten@@ tial , task .
we must first , however , optimis@@ e operational cooperation between the Member States ; for example , we must ensure that information can be ex@@ changed quickly and smo@@ oth@@ ly between Member States &quot; police forces and judic@@ i@@ aries .
this principle of availa@@ bility will constitute a major step forward in cooperation between police forces and the Presidency will set about this task at the earli@@ est opportunity .
we also wish to strengthen the European judicial area , which is based on both mutual recognition and the appro@@ xim@@ ation of laws .
we shall ensure , in particular , that negotiations are dri@@ ven forward on the European evidence war@@ r@@ ant and on the possible establishment of a European criminal record .
this will make European security str@@ onger and will not be to the d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ ent of public freedoms , nor must it be , since those freedoms form part of the European way of co@@ existence .
the fight against terrorism must be a permanent priority .
in this regard , I wish to s@@ alu@@ te the Spanish initiative to h@@ ost a meeting of the Heads of State or Government in Mad@@ rid in March .
the Presidency , for its part , will place particular emphasis on combating the financing of terrorism .
as far as the str@@ and of asylum and immigration is concerned , the Presidency will focus on three elements : strengthening part@@ ner@@ ships with countries of origin and of tr@@ ansi@@ t ; establishing a harmon@@ ised approach with regard to the policy of return and read@@ mission ; and the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders beg@@ ins its du@@ ties on 1 May .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we often refer - and rightly so - to the Europe of the citizens .
let us not be under any ill@@ u@@ sions .
if we do not succeed in making the EU an area of work and well @-@ being for all , the citizens will become ali@@ en@@ ated from Europe , from its Union and from the political project that under@@ p@@ ins it .
in order to sta@@ ve off that risk and to give Europe back its economic and social place , we laun@@ ched the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy almost five years ago .
we wanted - and we still want - to make the EU the most competitive and most dyna@@ mic knowledge @-@ based economy in the world , capable of sustain@@ ed economic growth , with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion , and one that res@@ pects the environment and natural resources .
after five years of qualified success , the time has come for a mid @-@ term review , which we shall draw up for the s@@ pring European Council .
the first task will be to clarify the aim of the strategy that we are to pursue .
the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy - a name that , to my mind , means absolutely nothing to most people - is in fact a strategy for competitiveness , growth , social cohesion and the protection of the environment .
it should be based on sol@@ id foun@@ dations of sustainable well @-@ being for Europeans .
we must act now in order , in the future , to guarantee access for all to the European social model , which must not be turned into a my@@ th , but should remain , or rather , should return to being , a living reality for all .
if we want to keep the European social model in@@ tac@@ t , it must be re@@ formed so that it can provide a response to the growth crisis , to under @-@ employment , to the wea@@ ken@@ ing of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of society , to the los@@ s of competitiveness and produc@@ ti@@ vity , to the fall@@ ing b@@ ir@@ th @-@ rate and to the ag@@ eing of our popula@@ tions .
naturally , Europeans do not like reforms ; they are s@@ car@@ ed by them and do not understand the reasons behind them .
we must explain to them that the reforms that we are proposing are intended to guarantee the sur@@ vi@@ val and the vi@@ ability of the European social model .
we must conv@@ in@@ ce them that putting off those reforms would prove more expen@@ sive .
we must prove to them that we are right to act and would be wrong to do nothing .
the bo@@ tto@@ m line is that we need to re@@ invi@@ g@@ or@@ ate Europe .
the next step , when we draw up the mid @-@ term review , is to keep together the three pill@@ ars of the S@@ trate@@ gy - the economic , the social and the environmental .
I am well aware that Europe has a competitiveness problem , which largely expla@@ ins its medi@@ oc@@ re per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in terms of growth and jobs .
of course competitiveness must be ste@@ pped up .
it is not , however , an end in itself , nor some neu@@ tra@@ l , self @-@ sufficient benefit .
no , the competitiveness that we must seek should provide us with str@@ onger and more sustainable growth and should be aimed at greater social cohesion and a more harmon@@ i@@ ously @-@ balanced environment .
please let us not start a fo@@ ol@@ ish and poin@@ t@@ less debate over whether we should have more competitiveness and thus less social cohesion , or more social , and less environmental , cohesion .
if Europe wishes to be strong , it needs three things , and those three things go together : greater competitiveness , greater social cohesion and a better @-@ balanced natural environment .
I say yes to competitiveness ; I say no to giving up our social and ec@@ ological amb@@ itions .
I say yes , for example , to opening up service markets , but I say no to social du@@ mp@@ ing , an element that some people would like to promote .
the bo@@ tto@@ m line , Mr President , is that we must find the right way of ensuring that the strategy is successful .
after five years of char@@ ting a r@@ ud@@ der@@ less course between success and failure , it is not so much a matter of know@@ ing what we must do - because after all we do know - it is more a matter of know@@ ing how we are to go about it .
it is essential that we make the European learning area a reality , step up the research effort , improve our education systems and fos@@ ter lif@@ el@@ ong learning .
this is what we must do , but how do we go about it ?
we have far too many processes in Europe .
we have the broad economic policy guidelines , the employment guidelines , the sustainable development strategy , the internal market strategy , the small and medium @-@ sized business char@@ ter , the C@@ olog@@ ne process , the Car@@ di@@ ff process , and many others .
all too often , these processes become bo@@ g@@ ged down in bureauc@@ ratic procedures that lead no@@ where .
the EU is more like a research uni@@ t - a uni@@ t of un@@ used research , at that - than a fac@@ tory of ideas that are practical and are put into practice .
we must change this by stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ing our strategy .
our strategy is essentially European , but its implementation must first be national .
we should like this strategy to remain essentially European .
it must be subject to a broad review every two years , or prefer@@ ably every three years .
we cannot change strategy every six months , from Council to Council , according to the wh@@ im@@ s of the presid@@ encies and to what is ins@@ p@@ ir@@ ing them at the time .
the strategy must be there for the long ha@@ u@@ l .
we should like implementation at national level to be spe@@ ed@@ ed up and ste@@ pped up . we are proposing that Member States should set up action programmes at national level .
these should be designed in con@@ jun@@ ction with the social partners and must be presented to national parliaments , which , along with the Community bodies , would monitor their implementation .
these national programmes would take account of the particular national and regional character@@ is@@ tics and should provide the possibility for assess@@ ing the p@@ ace and inten@@ s@@ ity of the respec@@ tive national reforms separ@@ ately and should make it easier to g@@ au@@ ge the level of per@@ for@@ man@@ ce achieved up to a given point .
so much for the strategy and the way in which it is to be implemented .
we shall discuss this matter again together , Parliament , the Council and both of us with the Commission , which will soon present its sum@@ mar@@ y report to us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the parti@@ al re@@ ori@@ entation of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy also invi@@ tes us to reflect on the Growth and Stability Pact .
I be@@ g your par@@ d@@ on , the Stability and Growth Pact !
actually , I would have prefer@@ red it the other way round .
yet as Europe was govern@@ ed in 1996 by our old friends - and not the ones you would think ! - the second order was the one that was kept .
we beg@@ an a review of the Pact under the Dutch Presidency and we should like to conclude it under the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
we are going to reform the Pact , or rather , to ad@@ just its implementing measures .
let me explain this by first deta@@ il@@ ing what we are not going to do .
economic and Monetary Union needs stability .
we therefore have no intention of dri@@ ving stability away , neither in what we say nor in what we do .
stability is a foun@@ ding element of the p@@ act that forms the basis of the euro .
we promis@@ ed a stable currency .
it will remain stable and it will remain strong .
it follows - let me say right away - that the Presidency will not propose to neu@@ tr@@ alise or im@@ mun@@ ise certain categ@@ or@@ ies of budgetary spending applic@@ able under the Pact .
it follows that the basic criteria - 3 % for the defic@@ it , 60 % for the deb@@ t - will remain applic@@ able .
it is clear to me , however , that changes must be made , not least in order that the Pact can take better account of the economic cy@@ cle .
during times of strong economic growth , Member States in the euro zone must , as a matter of priority , be required to alloc@@ ate budget sur@@ pl@@ uses to reducing the deb@@ t and the defic@@ it .
we shall en@@ rich the preven@@ ta@@ tive element of the Pact by means of a strong d@@ ose of ex@@ tra stability .
during times of wea@@ k growth , on the other hand , Member States in the euro zone should be given more reac@@ tive room for man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re as regards the budget .
the greater the efforts to reduce the defic@@ it and the deb@@ t during perio@@ ds of economic ex@@ pan@@ sion , the wid@@ er that room for man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re .
if , during perio@@ ds of wea@@ k growth , a Member State inc@@ urs an excessive defic@@ it , this situation and the consequences ar@@ ising from it , not least in terms of the ti@@ ming of correc@@ tion , will be jud@@ ged by means of objective measures of assessment .
we must avoid at all costs ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary political judg@@ ments that might lead to differ@@ ing assess@@ ments based on the siz@@ e of the country .
from this perspective , Luxemb@@ our@@ g is always the los@@ er .
Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it , we shall have a proper debate when the time comes , in committee , without too many wit@@ n@@ esses , on the compar@@ is@@ on that could be made between France , Germany and Luxemb@@ our@@ g as regards taxation .
it is a debate that will be interesting and infor@@ ma@@ tive for those who , I must say , view Luxemb@@ our@@ g in a somewhat super@@ fic@@ ial manner .
let me inv@@ ite you to a cal@@ m debate about the Pact .
I am w@@ ary of extre@@ me solutions .
I say no to those who seek to re@@ place stability with bra@@ z@@ en , un@@ br@@ id@@ led flexibility , as well as to those who seek to set the Pact , as it is now , in the cement of do@@ g@@ ma .
we need greater stability and greater flexibility to take account of the economic cy@@ cle .
Mr President , you would no doubt be surpris@@ ed if I failed to mention the debate that we are to hold on the financial perspec@@ tives .
in fron@@ t of you , I would not wish to detail the com@@ pon@@ ent parts of this - it must be said - difficult d@@ os@@ si@@ er , because your g@@ ras@@ p of them is better than min@@ e .
I shall simply say that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agreement on the financial perspec@@ tives before the end of June .
I am not under any ill@@ u@@ sions , however .
the Member States are currently entr@@ en@@ ched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time , by which I mean now !
if we do not reach an agreement on a common position under the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , by 1 January 2007 , it will be politically , legisla@@ tively and techn@@ ically impossible to meet the challenge of the enlarged EU .
consequently , no institution or Member State will have any interest in playing ex@@ tra time .
the abs@@ ence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency &apos;s failure , which is only of very min@@ or interest to me , but Europe &apos;s failure . let us decide .
let us decide quickly .
let us decide now .
we must s@@ par@@ e Europe a long , drawn @-@ out debate las@@ ting 18 months or even more .
that would cause even more dispu@@ tes and exac@@ er@@ b@@ ate the conflicts between the Member States and the institutions .
Mr President , I am re@@ lying on Parliament to dri@@ ve forward the decision @-@ making process on the financial perspec@@ tives .
we shall work with you , because your agreement is necessary .
you will not be han@@ ded a , I guarantee you that .
that , Mr President , is the th@@ r@@ ust of our programme .
presid@@ encies come and go , but for@@ tunately Europe remains .
we want to serve Europe with determination and pas@@ sion , with the determination and the pas@@ sion that long dis@@ tan@@ ces and gr@@ and amb@@ itions require .
given the applause you have received , we can expect the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency to be very positive .
that is what Parliament wants to see .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the half @-@ year that has just be@@ gu@@ n will fe@@ a@@ ture a series of important lan@@ d@@ mar@@ ks that will determin@@ e whether the EU will be able to meet the objective of achieving a higher level of prosperity , solidarity and security for the citizens .
much of what the Commission may ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ h during the coming years will be determined by the initial decisions taken during this term and by our capacity to resolve difficult questions and to achieve practical results .
I should therefore like to highlight , from the Commission &apos;s perspective , the particular importance of this Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency in this first half @-@ year of 2005 .
accord@@ ingly , the Commission will table the programme for the period 2004 @-@ 200@@ 9 as early as 26 January .
we hope that the other institutions can agree to this programme so that it can become not just part of the Commission &apos;s programme , but part of the programme for the entire Union , thus anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating the provisions of the European Constitution , and we can then begin right away to work within the spirit of the Constitution .
Luxemb@@ our@@ g has the responsibility of cha@@ ir@@ ing the Council during this crucial period .
I feel that it is a pri@@ vil@@ e@@ ge for us to have Prime Minister Jun@@ ck@@ er as President of the Council during this period , given his in@@ valuable experience as He@@ ad of Government , his deep@@ ly @-@ held European con@@ vic@@ tion and his well @-@ known ability to resolve tric@@ ky situations .
from a personal point of view , it is a ple@@ asure for me to work with my fri@@ end J@@ ean @-@ C@@ la@@ ude Jun@@ ck@@ er .
Mr President , we have heard from the Presidency about its expectations and priorities .
let me comment briefly on just three of the main issues that will be on the agenda of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency ; there are many others , but I wish to concentra@@ te on three .
the first is the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy .
Europe is facing very important challenges , most of which were already identi@@ fied at Lisbon 2000 .
but we could say today that the challenges from globalisation and the ag@@ eing of the population make even cle@@ ar@@ er the need to adap@@ t to increasingly difficult situations .
Europe &apos;s prosperity is under threat .
to tackle this threat we need more growth and more jobs .
if we continue on the path of low , d@@ imin@@ is@@ hing economic growth , we put all our policies at risk , but in particular our capacity to ensure solidarity and security and to preser@@ ve and improve the European model .
as out@@ lined in the K@@ o@@ k report , to be more effective the Lisbon priorities need to be ref@@ oc@@ used , stre@@ am@@ lined and prior@@ it@@ ised .
too many priorities means no priority at all .
growth and jobs must be our priorities .
the Commission is working on a report which will present its views on the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy and propose guidelines for future action .
at this point in the prepar@@ ation of this report , two elements strik@@ e me as particularly con@@ sen@@ su@@ al .
the first is the knowledge economy .
re@@ turning to growth will require considerable investment in knowledge .
companies cannot become more competitive without a better @-@ prepared labour force . only well @-@ tra@@ ined people can ensure high produc@@ ti@@ vity .
this requires un@@ preced@@ ented effort in the areas of research , development , education and training .
particular effort will be required to involve young people in this investment for knowledge .
higher produc@@ ti@@ vity should lead to higher growth , which , in turn , would create more jobs .
I do not see knowledge pu@@ rely as an instrument for other objectives : knowledge in itself is an important goal and a vehic@@ le for self @-@ re@@ alisation .
the second con@@ sen@@ su@@ al point I can under@@ line at this stage is about coher@@ ence in implementation , the deli@@ very problem .
the coher@@ ence between national actions and European action is a critical factor for success .
this means better implementation of the objectives agreed in common , which , in turn , means more responsibility and more em@@ power@@ ment at national level to del@@ iv@@ er the common objectives .
in this ve@@ in , the Commission report will also highlight clearly the importance of ensuring ow@@ nership of the revis@@ ed Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy by the Member States .
all in all , I must stress that the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy is , first , an agenda for modern@@ isation .
whether we will succeed depen@@ ds on our ability to establish an effective partnership between our institutions and citizens to del@@ iv@@ er this reform .
I should now like to present to you our view of the financial perspec@@ tives .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency has rightly decided to put everything into s@@ tri@@ ving to reach an agreement on the financial perspec@@ tives before the end of June 2005 .
it is right to do so , because failure to reach an agreement in time will lead to significant difficulties for the prepar@@ ation of the programmes concerned .
it strik@@ es me as important , however - at a time when a final negoti@@ ation might get under@@ way - to point out certain s@@ ali@@ ent facts .
we cannot have more Europe with fe@@ wer financial resources .
the Commission &apos;s proposal has not fall@@ en out of the s@@ ky ; it is the result of commitments agreed by the EU during the European Coun@@ c@@ ils .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , the Commission does not ask that the Union be granted funding for new projects , but us@@ u@@ ally that it be granted funding for commitments already made ; Member States must hon@@ our the commitments that they have already made .
I should like , if I may , to point out certain issues on which I feel that the Union must not compromise .
the first of these is cohesion .
ladies and gentlemen , without solidarity there is no Union .
there might be something else , but not a Union .
enlargement has had a far @-@ reaching impact on solidarity .
the Union has new regions la@@ gg@@ ing behind in development , and some of the less prosper@@ ous old regions still need support .
financial solidarity is therefore all the more necessary given that regions la@@ gg@@ ing behind in development have the greatest scope for growth in competitiveness and job creation .
we must not disap@@ point the new EU Members , which have the right to active solidarity from the entire Union .
secondly , we must not forget the question of competitiveness .
with regard to the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy , I said that mas@@ sive investment in research and education was essential .
indeed , European level expenditure very often brings more re@@ ward than national level expenditure without coher@@ ence .
I should also add tr@@ ans @-@ European networks to the list of priorities , given that the infrastructure that connec@@ ts Europe is still in dec@@ line .
the third crucial aspect of the financial perspec@@ tives is that of security .
the action programme agreed at the European Council has major financial implications .
the programme known as the &apos; H@@ ag@@ ue Programme &quot; has financial implications .
this means more action at European level so that the financial burden and collective security can be shared better among the Member States .
the citizens of Europe expect us to have the ability to work together .
one Member State on its own , even the most power@@ ful , cannot guarantee the best possible security if it does not form part of a joint , European @-@ level effort .
the bo@@ tto@@ m line is that we cannot have more Europe with less money .
I hear people from time to time calling for a fre@@ e@@ z@@ e on Community bud@@ gets bel@@ ow the level of the 2006 budget .
let us be clear on this matter : that would be a Europe that rene@@ ges on its commitments .
I wish to state clearly that the Commission would wish to have nothing to do with a Europe of back@@ trac@@ king , a Europe of medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity , a Europe of reduced aims .
this is why I am delighted that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will do everything in its power to reach a compromise agreement this term .
some people will say that this will be difficult , even un@@ likely .
I hon@@ es@@ tly believe that the longer we leave this , the more difficult it will be .
we therefore support the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency in this difficult , yet extremely important , task .
as for the Stability and Growth Pact , we welcome the fact that one of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s priorities is to ensure that multila@@ teral budgetary monitoring will make a greater contribution to a strong , heal@@ thy and successful economic and monetary Union .
these principles under@@ p@@ in the Stability and Growth Pact and this Pact must be respected and must func@@ tion properly .
let us not forget that the single currency is one of Europe &apos;s great achiev@@ ements .
I remember before the euro came into force , certain experts , econom@@ ists and prof@@ ess@@ ors , particularly on the other side of the Atlan@@ tic , were saying that Europe would never be able to have a strong currency because of its lack of solidarity and political cohesion .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ ys , some are saying that our currency might be too strong , but not too wea@@ k .
the single currency is therefore an historic European success s@@ tory .
we must not now je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e that great success .
at the end of 2003 , the Commission initi@@ ated a reflec@@ tion process on the experience that has been ga@@ ined , in order to identi@@ fy possible changes and improvements that might help us to implement the Pact more effici@@ ently .
convinced that the common interest com@@ man@@ ds that every@@ body comply with every rule , the Commission has been in contact with the various European bodies responsible for thinking together and for expl@@ or@@ ing together the most promis@@ ing a@@ ven@@ ues , such as those tabled in our Commun@@ ication of September 2004 .
the Presidency &apos;s contribution will be instru@@ mental in eng@@ en@@ der@@ ing a consensus of opinion .
we are already expec@@ ting such a consensus at the E@@ co@@ fin Council on 18 January .
the Commission will thus be able to put forward practical proposals to improve the implementation of the Pact and this in time for the discussions at the European Council in March .
in the next six months , the ability of the European Union to return to growth will be put to the test .
it will have to provide the financial means necessary to mat@@ ch its political cho@@ ices .
it must work closer to citizens and reg@@ a@@ in their trust .
it must strengthen its role on the international sc@@ ene and rela@@ un@@ ch its strategic part@@ ner@@ ships .
there is now a special opportunity for rela@@ un@@ ching the Middle East peace process .
the European Union can and should give a greater contribution in this field .
I believe that the European Union will play a str@@ onger role on the international sc@@ ene .
the Commission strongly supports the efforts of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency on this path .
the Commission believes that this period is critical and that our institutions will need to work together even more closely to achieve results .
. Mr President , Mr President of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome to the House today the Presidents of the European Council and of the Commission , and I ga@@ ther that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission un@@ ve@@ ils its programme in Brussels on 26 January .
I see that as a s@@ plen@@ did sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l for the ever @-@ growing cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
future presid@@ encies should take that as an example to follow .
although we were very pleased to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia , vis@@ iting J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta as an expression of the European Union &apos;s solidarity , I would like to emphasise that , however necessary solidarity with the stric@@ ken areas might be , we must not over@@ look the great problems in Africa and in other parts of the world .
we have to consider how we can , in so far as we are able , take preven@@ tive measures , in the sha@@ pe of an early war@@ ning system , in Europe too , for example in the Mediterranean .
we are very much behind you , Mr President of the Council , in what you had to say about the Community method .
Luxemb@@ our@@ g may well be small in ge@@ ograph@@ ical terms , but it is a G@@ r@@ and Du@@ ch@@ y and hence a great country , and the B@@ en@@ el@@ u@@ x states &quot; presid@@ encies have always been excellent ones .
we wish you great success ; for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats too , the Constitution is of the ut@@ most priority .
in Brussels , we will have in @-@ de@@ p@@ th discussions on the Lisbon strategy , even though making the European economy competitive is not an end in itself , for the fact is that a strong economy is the best guarantee of good social policy .
we see competitiveness as being about creating more jobs in Europe by way of growth and better conditions for European businesses .
for us , that is social policy in the true sense of the word .
rather than setting ec@@ ology and the protection of the environment against the economy , we need a sensible balance between them .
we also wish you and your presidency success in hand@@ ling the financial perspective .
to those ladies and gentlemen - in this instance , no doubt , only gentlemen - who w@@ ro@@ te let@@ ters argu@@ ing in favour of the 1 % limit , we would say that you cannot en@@ large Europe and then ref@@ use the EU &apos;s new Member States the money that is an expression of our solidarity , and which they need in order to be brought up to our standards .
to do that , we in the European Union need the necessary funding to be made available .
you have mentioned the tre@@ aties that are to be signed , but how , in the abs@@ ence of any agreement by June and of any success in medium @-@ term financial planning , are we to c@@ ope with the accession of new states to the European Union ?
we are very glad that it is Re@@ im@@ er B@@ ö@@ ge , a very competent member of our group , who will be wr@@ iting the report for this House .
you also made reference to the Stability Pact .
I am very grateful to you for what you said , and I can agree with every word of it .
what you said bo@@ ils down , in ess@@ ence , to the need for more flexibility .
the thing about flexibility is that it is those states that have made provisions that have more of it .
to come to the point , then , the less in@@ deb@@ ted a state is , the more flexible it can be when times are hard for the economy , which also means that we have to do what has to be done to reduce defic@@ its when things are going well for the economy , for we know that today &apos;s deb@@ ts always end up being tomorrow &apos;s tax@@ es , and a burden on the public as a whole , particularly on the youn@@ ger generation .
let me just say something briefly about foreign policy issues , a number of which you have addressed , and - as I understand it - the President of the Commission is in full agreement with what you said .
our support for Ukraine is only just beginning and will have to be an ongoing responsibility .
if I may turn to Palestin@@ e , where elections have just taken place , we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state .
the European Union &apos;s role must not - contrary to what we are told by not a few high @-@ ran@@ king representatives from the Middle East - be merely a matter of providing financial support , but should involve us , as an hon@@ est bro@@ ker , making our contribution to bringing peace to the Middle East .
turning to tr@@ ans @-@ Atlan@@ tic relations , I wish you , and of course the President of the Commission , great success with President Bush &apos;s visit , which will us@@ her in a new er@@ a of good relations with the United States of America .
we cannot have two groups of states in the European Union , each with its own way of maintaining relations with the USA .
we Europeans must un@@ ite in taking up a position foun@@ ded upon partnership with our American friends , and so , as you , Mr President of the Council , have said , we in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , bring determination and pas@@ sion to supporting you , and wish you great success in your presidency .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the soci@@ alists are s@@ tri@@ ving for a Europe of excell@@ ence .
for us , the Lisbon policy constitu@@ tes the best rou@@ te towards European competitiveness , the basis of a good life , indeed a better life , for our citizens .
that is what is known as social cohesion .
the EU must stop compla@@ ining that Europe is said to be fall@@ ing behind other regions of the world .
if Europe were no longer competitive , then how on ear@@ th could the Union account for the li@@ on &apos;s share of world trade ?
in 2003 , for example , the Union accoun@@ ted for 40 % of the trade in goods and 45 % of the trade in services throughout the world , more than the United States , Jap@@ an and China put together .
of course some of our indus@@ tries are suffering from competition from countries in which sal@@ aries are low , but we will not make better products by dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling our social model .
I should like to address the following remarks to some con@@ serva@@ tive and liber@@ al Members of this House : protecting the right to work will provide workers with a sense of security and even well @-@ being .
in other words , this is an important factor in workers &quot; produc@@ ti@@ vity , and , in turn , in companies &quot; competitiveness .
there is no conflict , but compl@@ emen@@ tar@@ ity .
that is a quo@@ te from Mr B@@ il@@ t@@ gen , the chairman of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Christian Social Party , an em@@ in@@ ent member of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ...
President Jun@@ ck@@ er lead@@ s a co@@ al@@ ition government of the Christian Social Party and the Socialists , which is a ben@@ ch@@ mark by which to re@@ invi@@ g@@ or@@ ate the Union on the basis of broad political consensus .
the European Socialists have high hop@@ es for this Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , primarily from the point of view of rela@@ un@@ ching the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy and of turning it into a genuine instrument of progress , particularly at the level of the 25 .
to this end , the ma@@ cro@@ economic framework must be re@@ direc@@ ted towards a policy of growth and stability .
stability is a public good that must be def@@ en@@ ded in the interests of our poor@@ est citizens .
there will never be stability , however , without strong economic growth .
the Stability and Growth Pact must become an instrument that provides a means of both combating public defic@@ it and fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ing an economic policy in tun@@ e with the economic cy@@ cles .
fis@@ cal dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine is required in times of strong economic growth and more flexibility during perio@@ ds of rec@@ ession .
when it ass@@ esses each country &apos;s public finan@@ ces , the Commission must also ass@@ ess the quality of spending .
the practice of bor@@ ro@@ wing to finance running costs must be bann@@ ed ; bor@@ ro@@ wing must be con@@ fin@@ ed to investment to prepare for the future .
there cannot be more Europe with less money .
a Union of 4@@ 55 million in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants cannot develop with a budget in 2005 limited to 1.@@ 00@@ 4 % of Europe &apos;s G@@ N@@ P .
rela@@ un@@ ching Lisbon , the &apos; intellig@@ ent &quot; Stability and Growth Pact , financial perspec@@ tives that actually offer new perspec@@ tives for Europe : these are the Her@@ cu@@ le@@ an tasks facing the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
at the same time , we ask the Union not to forget the ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted people of the world .
if the international community is capable of offer@@ ing deb@@ t reli@@ ef to Iraq of some 80 % , and if it wishes to offer deb@@ t reli@@ ef to those countries h@@ it by the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi , it must also be capable of can@@ cell@@ ing the deb@@ t that wi@@ p@@ es out any development in developing world countries .
.
Mr President , this is the el@@ ev@@ ent@@ h Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , your presidency has high standards of its own to live up to and the high expectations of others to meet .
si@@ mul@@ ta@@ ne@@ ously President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council and of the Economic and Fin@@ ance Council , you are in a uni@@ que position from which to reach agreement on one of your b@@ ig@@ g@@ est and most del@@ icate objectives - the financial perspec@@ tives for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
Liber@@ als and Democrats are pleased to note that in your presidency programme you say that &apos; all progress towards European construction requires adequate financial resources &apos; .
we hope you will not be limited by do@@ g@@ matic demands to ca@@ p the Union &apos;s budget at 1 % for the next dec@@ ade .
we are not prof@@ li@@ g@@ ate with European citizens &apos; tax@@ es and we insist that every euro be well spent and properly accoun@@ ted for .
nonetheless , we , too , recognise that the European Union has justi@@ fi@@ able amb@@ itions , whether to run a coherent security strategy , gener@@ ous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohesion .
these all have a cost , and we should not limit our political amb@@ itions by p@@ enn@@ y @-@ pin@@ ching over what is , after all , a rela@@ tively mo@@ des@@ t budget .
I wish you every success in sec@@ uring agreement in June , for I fear the approach of your success@@ ors in this , as in other matters , is un@@ likely to comm@@ and a consensus .
my Group will call upon you to speci@@ fy new arrangements for the Stability and Growth Pact , which under@@ p@@ ins the single currency .
as &apos; Mr Euro &apos; , it is your right and duty to speak out for the euro and the euro zone .
if France and Germany are allowed to es@@ cap@@ e with a mil@@ d re@@ bu@@ ke for exc@@ eed@@ ing the defic@@ it limits for several con@@ secu@@ tive years , if Greece is ab@@ sol@@ ved from mis@@ repres@@ enting its true fis@@ cal state to gain f@@ ast @-@ tra@@ ck entry to the euro , and if Italy continues to be rec@@ kl@@ ess with its budget while har@@ bour@@ ing a public deb@@ t of over 100 % , who will have confidence in those rules ?
the Stability Pact needs adjus@@ ting but it also needs en@@ for@@ cing , with proper monitoring arrangements like those used by the I@@ M@@ F .
we will look to you and your Council colleagues to be vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant and true to your commitments .
your term in office will co@@ inc@@ ide with the mid @-@ term review of the much va@@ un@@ ted and little respected Lisbon Agenda .
it is in serious danger of sta@@ lling .
your commitment to a rela@@ un@@ ch at this hal@@ f@@ way mark will bear fru@@ it if you succeed in compl@@ et@@ ing the single market , in finding more funding for research and in promoting a fav@@ ourable climate for ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ ship .
but do not try to be all things to all people .
structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon .
neither should you under@@ estima@@ te the challenge of en@@ for@@ cing existing directives .
your proposal to make national governments accoun@@ table to their pe@@ ers , as well as to national parliaments and public opinion , is a good one and the Commission must be entr@@ us@@ ted to monitor the measures needed and not be af@@ ra@@ id to name and sha@@ me the la@@ gg@@ ards .
my Group also wel@@ comes your commitment to move to the Community method in matters of justice and home affairs so important to our citizens .
we also share your amb@@ itions for enlargement .
new arri@@ val@@ s are on the hor@@ iz@@ on . Bulgar@@ ia and Romania will shor@@ tly be join@@ ing us .
C@@ roati@@ a is a candidate country with which you must open negotiations .
let us be clear , as regards C@@ roati@@ a , that we expect General Go@@ to@@ vina to hand himself over or be turned over to The H@@ ag@@ ue to answer the case against him .
C@@ roati@@ a cannot duc@@ k that issue .
as Mr Poettering said , we cannot ignor@@ e the mom@@ ent@@ ous events in Ukraine in the last two months .
as a collective body of institutions , we must encourage the opening @-@ up of that country and review bilateral relations in the light of new circumstances .
that is a task for your presidency .
in conclusion , as the Constitution en@@ ters its ratification phase , you may have three referen@@ da on your w@@ at@@ ch , and you must do all in your power to make sure they succeed .
if political forces in Spain are allowed to raise the gh@@ ost of regional autonom@@ y , if , in France , the debate is mu@@ d@@ di@@ ed by Turkish membership , if , in Bri@@ tain , EU financing becomes an issue in the Constitutional Treaty debate , the whole thing will come cr@@ as@@ hing down around Europe &apos;s e@@ ars .
leave those issues where they bel@@ ong and make sure Europe gets the Constitution it needs .
. - Mr President , today I have just dis@@ covered once again that Christian Democ@@ rat in one country does not mean the same thing as Christian Democ@@ rat in another country , I congratulate you ...
the same goes for the Gre@@ ens , but at the moment , I am addres@@ sing the President of the Union and not the President of the European Gre@@ ens .
that is the difference , Mr Poettering !
you said something very interesting .
if you are actually setting up a working group with Mr Barroso to look at the Lisbon process , I shall be very interested in taking part , in order to try and have every@@ body sing@@ ing from the same hy@@ m@@ n @-@ s@@ he@@ et .
in fact , we agree with you and dis@@ agree with Mr Barroso ; competitiveness must go hand in hand with sustainable growth , with social solidarity and environmental responsibility .
Mr Barroso for@@ got three of these four elements and this is why we need a working group between the Commission and the Council to have every@@ body sing@@ ing from the same hy@@ m@@ n @-@ s@@ he@@ et .
we are on your side , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
as regards the financial perspec@@ tives , every@@ body is once again in agreement .
par@@ ap@@ h@@ ras@@ ing V@@ ic@@ tor Hu@@ go , I should like to tell you that l@@ etting st@@ ing@@ y countries go@@ ver@@ n Europe is tan@@ tam@@ oun@@ t to l@@ etting a h@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ e go@@ ver@@ n the oc@@ ean .
that is something we do not want .
it is appar@@ ent that when the h@@ ur@@ ric@@ an@@ e govern@@ s the oc@@ ean , everything coll@@ ap@@ ses .
if the st@@ ing@@ y countries - by which I mean countries and governments that are very close to me - pre@@ va@@ il with their 1 % , Europe will be the los@@ er .
we are therefore on your side , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , in the fight against any attemp@@ ts at reducing the European budget .
reducing the European budget is in fact tan@@ tam@@ oun@@ t to l@@ etting Europe coll@@ ap@@ se .
I should like to say one other thing - and this is very important - about education .
I refer to the debate initi@@ ated by the Organisation for Economic Co@@ operation and Development with the Programme for International S@@ tu@@ d@@ ent A@@ ss@@ ess@@ ment .
when discussing education , it is important to have the courage to say what works and what does not work in the Member States .
it is not enough to speak of the need to edu@@ c@@ ate , one must also say that there are education systems , te@@ ac@@ hing systems in Europe that are counter @-@ productive , reac@@ tionary and ide@@ ological .
to conclude , I should like to say that the ten@@ th an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary of the D@@ a@@ yt@@ on agreement and of S@@ re@@ br@@ en@@ ic@@ a fall@@ s during your Presidency .
I therefore ask Europe to take steps to revis@@ e the D@@ a@@ yt@@ on agreement , which might have been a necessary measure in its time , but which is unacceptable in view of the Constitution now in force in Bos@@ nia and Her@@ z@@ e@@ go@@ vina .
consequently , on the occasion of ten years since S@@ re@@ br@@ en@@ ic@@ a , I ask you , on Europe &apos;s behalf , to take steps to revis@@ e the D@@ a@@ yt@@ on agreement .
. Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , I should first of all like to thank you for your introduction .
I would like to wish the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency success , and I wish it more wis@@ dom than its Dutch pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ or had , although you have already made a little with your re@@ mark about the Constitution .
I urge you to give the public the opportunity to make up their own min@@ ds in a fair @-@ min@@ ded manner .
my first question to you is a short one .
it was six years ago that the euro was introduced .
at the time , in 1999 , European unemployment stood at 9 % , and has remain@@ ed at that level to this day , while economic growth has s@@ low@@ ed down .
my question to you is : do you not consider it high time we submitted the euro to a thorou@@ gh over@@ ha@@ u@@ l , in which you , in fact , could take the lead ?
I regret the abs@@ ence from your agenda of the contin@@ uation of the debate , initi@@ ated under the Dutch Presidency , on the control of animal diseases .
had this sli@@ pped your mind ?
according to your list of priorities , there are many mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ding the services directive .
exactly what kind of mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings do you mean , and who , in your view , is la@@ bour@@ ing under them ?
is it the Commission , Parliament or the thousands of workers who have already vo@@ ic@@ ed their dis@@ approval of this services directive ?
from your wish to reas@@ s@@ ess the proposal in a more objective light , as you descri@@ be it , can I de@@ duce that you share my view that the services directive is an extremely va@@ gue document that my fellow @-@ coun@@ tr@@ y@@ man , Commissioner Bolkestein , should never even have tabled ?
does the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency have concrete proposals for amen@@ ding the Commission proposal on the services directive ?
if not , I would inv@@ ite you to travel with me through the Netherlands .
you would be able to get to know those important public services , such as education and health care , that the directive pu@@ ts in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy .
I could also introduce you to those commercial service provid@@ ers , including the co@@ ff@@ ee sho@@ p &apos; De T@@ ev@@ re@@ den Ro@@ ker &apos; &#91; The S@@ at@@ is@@ fied S@@ mo@@ ker &#93; and the &apos; P@@ ic@@ o@@ be@@ ll@@ o E@@ sc@@ or@@ t Ser@@ vice &apos; c@@ lu@@ b , which would certainly be keen to become active in Luxemb@@ our@@ g , or elsewhere for that matter .
to my mind , services of that kind are expres@@ sions of Dutch culture and thanks to the services directive , we will be able to inf@@ lic@@ t them on everyone .
you will ga@@ ther that these last words were meant as a pro@@ vo@@ cation , but I should like to ask you in all seri@@ ous@@ ness to take me up on my invi@@ tation .
we may then be able to have the des@@ per@@ ately needed debate about the services directive , which seems to be ab@@ sent in too many crucial places in Europe .
.
Mr President , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er &apos;s speech was made with all the pas@@ sion that a civil ser@@ v@@ ant is likely to raise .
Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority , but your past statements serve to ill@@ ustra@@ te only the in@@ consisten@@ cies .
whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the p@@ act &apos;s original rules , you recently said that the credibility of the p@@ act had been bu@@ ried and that the p@@ act was de@@ ad .
is that still your opinion ?
you also said that you have a w@@ in@@ dow of opportunity to cut a quic@@ k deal on the EU budget , including the British re@@ b@@ ate of some EUR 4 billion a year .
is that so , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er ?
the re@@ b@@ ate took to negoti@@ ate .
if your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June , then Mr Bla@@ ir must have agreed in principle to sur@@ ren@@ der the re@@ b@@ ate .
is that the case ?
with whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating ?
will the British elector@@ ate know about this at the time of the British general election , probably in May ?
finally , the UK In@@ depend@@ ence Party , and in particular my colleague Mr F@@ ar@@ age , has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner .
more details will follow shor@@ tly and reg@@ ularly .
are you to be tain@@ ted by association with them , or will you be expres@@ sing your concerns and the pres@@ sing need for change ?
. - Mr President , the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s programme is pac@@ ked with crucial issues for the future of Europe , including the priorities on the economic fron@@ t : the Lisbon strategy , reform of the Stability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 20@@ 13 .
my first point is that it will soon be time for the mid @-@ term review of the level of implementation of the Lisbon strategy .
to give it a greater chance of success , the programme needs to make the individual Member States responsible for achieving the targets that were set .
to that end , I consider the proposal to speci@@ fy an individual at national level to be responsible for putting the strategy into practice to be a very useful idea .
secondly , with regard to the review of the Stability Pact , it has also been emphas@@ ised this morning that a reform is needed which can propose a more flexible interpre@@ tation of the Pact during times of rec@@ ession , without by@@ pass@@ ing the Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t criteria and without giving up the commitment to reduce the deb@@ t .
I am also convinced that steps could be taken to exclu@@ de certain specific types of investment from the cal@@ cula@@ tion of the defic@@ it in order to give a new bo@@ ost to Europe &apos;s growth and competitiveness .
thirdly , I hope that we can really succeed in ap@@ prov@@ ing the financial perspective up to 20@@ 13 by June , so that the resources can be used to the full from the very beginning of the period in question .
I especially hope that the proposals - the Council &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s proposals on those important to@@ pic@@ s - are a@@ dequ@@ ately discussed in advan@@ ce by Parliament which , let us rec@@ all , is the only European institution that directly represents the soverei@@ gn@@ ty of the people .
lastly , I hope that a European civil protection agency will at last be set up during the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency so that natural disas@@ ters can be dealt with in an appropriate manner , with particular emphasis on prevention .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , there are many in this House who have , for some time , been keen to see you sitting opposite where you are now , and I am one of them .
the work programme you have presented is enormous , but you also have a re@@ pu@@ tation for working won@@ ders , and it is to the wonder @-@ work@@ er in you that I would like to appeal , asking you also to give attention to the Members &quot; sta@@ tute .
we urg@@ ently need a fair and credi@@ ble sta@@ tute of this kind .
some@@ where between your country and min@@ e is to be found not only the problem , but also the solution to it .
we are told that the German Government does not want one before the next elections , but , at the same time , the German model - as regards Members &quot; re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation rather than additional ear@@ n@@ ings and lob@@ by@@ ists - could serve as a basis for an agreement of this kind .
we have to put a stop to the un@@ wor@@ thy gre@@ ed in this place .
this House must ce@@ ase to be a parliament of the in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able , or else serious damage will be done to democracy , which is what this place is all about .
if the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council does not wish to reply to the very specific and precise questions that have just been put to him , we shall continue with the debate .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , Luxemb@@ our@@ g &apos;s Presidency of the Council in this first half of 2005 is very probably the last of its kind that we shall see .
under the European Constitution , by the time my country is next in line to take its turn in the presidency , the presidency of the Council of Heads of State or Government will have been perman@@ ently re@@ formed .
it follows that a last presidency - which is what this one is - must be a good one , and one whose succ@@ esses will stand the test of time .
the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est and most difficult tasks for our 2005 presidency have to do with finance policy ; its agenda is domin@@ ated by the determination of the financial framework for the period from 2007 to 20@@ 13 and by a more flexible interpre@@ tation of the Stability and Growth Pact .
the financial framework for the enlarged Union must be negoti@@ ated in such a way that an ambitious approach to the s@@ hap@@ ing of European policy is not ob@@ struc@@ ted by budgetary con@@ stra@@ ints at national level .
Europe &apos;s 4@@ 50 million in@@ ha@@ bi@@ tants expect the European Union to be able to take effective action , and we will not be meeting their expectations by dispu@@ ting over ten@@ ths and hun@@ dre@@ d@@ ths of perc@@ enta@@ ge points , so it is vital that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency should make a success of the tric@@ ky fe@@ at of giving the EU &apos;s financial planning a European dimension .
in so doing , it will be ac@@ ting in the interests of every European and of a Union that is not only enlarg@@ ing itself but also , and at the same time , benef@@ iting its citizens by putting its policies on an adequate and appropriate financial fo@@ o@@ ting , fail@@ ing which further ro@@ unds of enlargement will be quite beyond its capac@@ ities .
during the coming six months , Europe &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact is to be re@@ interpre@@ ted in line with the economic situation .
it is in fact economic good sense , as well as the demands of a dyna@@ mic employment policy in Europe , that require that it be adap@@ ted to take account of the re@@ alities of the growth cy@@ cle .
the fact is that the Pact is about growth as well as stability , and excessive ri@@ g@@ id@@ ity must not be allowed to ha@@ mp@@ er growth rather than promote it .
the Lisbon strategy fac@@ es its mid @-@ term review on 22 March of this year , when what has been achieved so far will be assess@@ ed and new priorities set .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency of the Council proposes that , by 2010 , every Member State should have set in motion tan@@ gible and demonstra@@ ble reforms in every one of the areas in which the Lisbon strategy requires action .
that having been said , the EU &apos;s economic environment will also under@@ go changes over the next five years .
Europe is not alone in the world in s@@ tri@@ ving to improve its per@@ for@@ man@@ ce and become more competitive , and so the Lisbon reform agenda will have to be success@@ fully implemented by 2010 .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency is well aware of that , and will endeav@@ our to ensure that its announ@@ cement is followed up by a stage in which progress is actually made .
finally , it matters a great deal to me that something should be said , in this debate , on the e@@ po@@ ch @-@ making events in Ukraine , which is a European state , one that has , in the last month , demonstrated its desire to be one of us , and its ability to en@@ rich the European family with its con@@ vic@@ tions and its experience .
if it should be under Luxemb@@ our@@ g &apos;s Presidency that a start is made on compl@@ et@@ ing the ma@@ p of Europe , we should bear in mind that Slova@@ kia , Pol@@ and , H@@ un@@ g@@ ary and Romania have a neigh@@ bour whose people see their future as being al@@ ong@@ side all of us in Europe .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , let me just start with a brief comment .
I see the sta@@ tute as too important an issue to be a pla@@ y@@ thing for dem@@ ago@@ gu@@ es , and so I would ask you to ignor@@ e the ra@@ b@@ ble @-@ ro@@ using ut@@ ter@@ an@@ ces that have been made and go ahead with what you plan to do with all your streng@@ th and in ear@@ n@@ est , addres@@ sing this issue and finding a solution to it .
your speech , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , was a very good one , and I would like to congratulate you on getting the right balance between the economy and society and particularly on giving priority to employment and growth .
if I may be fran@@ k , that is an example to many , and not just to Christian Democ@@ rat Heads of Government .
I would , though , also like to endorse what you said about the foreign policy aspects .
two countries in our vic@@ in@@ ity - Ukraine and Palestin@@ e - have held important elections in recent weeks .
in both ins@@ tan@@ ces , the European Union played a very active part in bringing about change through democratic , open and transparent elections , and Europe must , as you said , han@@ g on in there .
we must not disap@@ point the people whom we have , to some degree , mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted to sum@@ m@@ on up the courage to bring about changes , and whom we have help@@ ed to do so in a transparent manner .
do not let y@@ our@@ self be dis@@ coura@@ ged , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , for you are quite right to say that the development we are promoting and supporting in Ukraine is not a development in opposition to Russia , but we must nevertheless try to work together with Russia towards finding solutions .
Ukraine must not become the b@@ all in a ga@@ me of power politics played by the European Union and Russia .
Russia must of course acknowledge that there have been changes that it may find dis@@ agre@@ e@@ able , but which the people themselves have ch@@ os@@ en .
were these changes now to be pursu@@ ed to some degree in opposition to Russia , it would not be in Ukraine &apos;s interests , for it is too var@@ ied and too di@@ versi@@ fied , and we know that it is those parts that are to some extent al@@ ig@@ ned with Russia that are Ukraine &apos;s economic power@@ h@@ ous@@ es .
si@@ mil@@ arly , in Palestin@@ e , we need to remain involved and to continue giving political mor@@ al and financial support , as we have done for years , whilst always taking a critical line when it could not be clearly shown where the money was flo@@ wing .
we have brought about many changes and introduced a degree of transparency , including in the way Palestin@@ e is ad@@ minis@@ tered .
that is what we have achieved , and we will continue to do so if we get stu@@ ck in and , as has been said , do not limit ourselves to suppl@@ ying funds but also help the Palestinian people to gain a state of their own .
the only way to guarantee security in the Middle East is for there to be both an Israel that is secure within its own borders and also a new Palestinian state .
even if foreign policy is not one of your presidency &apos;s priorities from the word go , we cannot deser@@ t the people whom we have help@@ ed to bring about change ; it is also in our own interest , in the interests of stability and our own continent , that we should help them towards the real political goal .
Mr President , I welcome the presidency and congratulate it on its priorities .
I have four questions .
the EU fac@@ es very considerable challenges during the next six months .
naturally , the half @-@ term re@@ vie@@ w@@ of the@@ Lisbon process is one of the over@@ rid@@ ing issues .
it is time for European leaders to begin to act .
I much appreciate the presidency &apos;s statement that economic growth is important but that the other two pill@@ ars of stability are also needed , namely social and environmental development .
what , nonetheless , needs to be expla@@ ined is not merely the fact that you intend to improve the Lisbon process , but the way in which you intend to do this .
the other issue concerns the energy area .
a better environment and improved self @-@ suffici@@ ency are naturally very important and bring about economic growth .
the production of bi@@ om@@ as@@ s cre@@ ates jobs in dis@@ tric@@ ts and regions with low economic growth and can contribute to a better environment and to more stable energy production .
how do you intend to comb@@ ine the half @-@ term reform of agricultural policy with energy policy and industrial policy ?
mark T@@ wa@@ in once said that &apos; Al@@ l you need in this life is ignor@@ ance and confidence , and then success is sure . &quot;
obviously , that is not the case .
research policy needs to be strength@@ ened , and we need a knowledge @-@ based economy .
what will the presidency do to ensure fas@@ ter achiev@@ ement of the 3 % target where grants for research are concerned ?
finally , the four@@ th area .
nothing was mentioned about what is perhaps the most important legislative process under way , namely the C@@ hem@@ ic@@ als Directive , R@@ E@@ AC@@ H .
we have the opportunity to create a global standard if we comb@@ ine the Commission &apos;s proposal with better wor@@ ka@@ bility .
un@@ certainty is very expen@@ sive both for industry and the environment .
how do you intend to work with R@@ E@@ AC@@ H ?
finally , I should like to congratulate you on a very good pres@@ entation of the priorities and hope that , during the next six months , you will be able to achieve the objectives you have established .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I am delighted at the clear and coura@@ ge@@ ous statements that have been made by the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency with regard to sustainable development policy .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , to a greater extent than its pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors , is attemp@@ ting to maintain a balance between economic , social and environmental policies .
it is calling for something quite simple , namely that social and environmental policies be a starting point and not an end goal as far as growth policy is concerned .
I hope that this will be the line followed by the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency at the European Council and within the respec@@ tive sec@@ tor@@ al Coun@@ c@@ ils , and I am sure that your proposals on the main areas of work , namely the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives , the reform of the Stability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process , will be guid@@ ed by this spirit of sustainable development .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I also hope that you will find the energy to conv@@ in@@ ce the European Council that Europe should continue to act as the dri@@ ving force behind the Kyoto process .
after the European Union &apos;s success with Kyoto , it is essential that it now set out a long @-@ term framework for climate change policy , with objectives for the period 20@@ 20 @-@ 20@@ 50 .
this is what both our citizens and our economic pla@@ yers expect .
what guidelines will economic pla@@ yers in Europe follow when inves@@ ting in key sectors such as energy and transport , if we have not laid down a clear framework for future policies in this field ?
turning to the Lisbon strategy , you noted that it related to three areas , namely environmental , social and economic issues .
it is the ambitious environmental policies of recent dec@@ ad@@ es that have made Europe a global lead@@ er in environmental technologies and renew@@ able ener@@ g@@ ies .
I hope that you will revis@@ e C@@ hap@@ ter V of the K@@ o@@ ch report to ensure that the European economy can benefit from these ambitious policies .
the Lisbon agenda should also include an ambitious social policy .
the Commission is pres@@ sing for exten@@ sive liberalisation , in particular as proposed in the B@@ ol@@ ken@@ ste@@ in directive , and I am glad that you have expressed criticism of this directive , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er .
I hope that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will also take advantage of critic@@ isms from within the Com@@ pet@@ iti@@ veness Council to hold a debate on this directive , and , if necessary , to chec@@ k its progress , as well as to force the Commission to table a directive on services of general interest .
I believe that con@@ fu@@ sion will reign over the B@@ ol@@ ken@@ ste@@ in directive until the issue of services of general interest has been clari@@ fied .
I very much welcome the fact that this presidency aims to harmon@@ ise social , environmental and economic policies , as this is good ne@@ ws for Europe .
- Mr President , the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi trag@@ edy should be no less significant to the world &apos;s leaders and to Europe than 11 September .
the A@@ sian t@@ su@@ na@@ mi should act as a turning point for the most pres@@ sing of the world &apos;s priorities - that of preventing and combating hun@@ ger and disease .
I therefore wish to ask four questions .
firstly , do you believe that the EUR 4@@ 50 million announced for reconstruction might undermin@@ e programmes already planned for Asia ( as is the case of EUR 1@@ 50 million of the EUR 4@@ 50 million announced ) ?
secondly , do you intend to back the can@@ cell@@ ation of the deb@@ t of countries affected by the t@@ su@@ na@@ mi or do you advoc@@ ate just a mor@@ ator@@ ium ?
thirdly , will they be treated the same as Iraq , or worse than Iraq ?
lastly , Commissioner M@@ ic@@ he@@ l proposed to the last Council a more ambitious target than 0@@ .@@ 7 % for development .
will you re@@ consider this proposal , or will it be j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ ed for good ?
my de@@ ar Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , Luxemb@@ our@@ g &apos;s presid@@ encies of the EU are us@@ u@@ ally among the best , perhaps because a small country knows that it cannot monopol@@ ise the agenda but that it must be of service to everyone .
I am sure that you will continue that tradition , and would also call upon you and the Council to tre@@ at suppor@@ ters and op@@ pon@@ ents of the Constitution exactly the same .
our buil@@ dings here are full of expres@@ sions of commitment to a &apos; yes &quot; vote : &apos; yes &quot; sig@@ ns , b@@ ad@@ ges and b@@ all@@ o@@ ons , their presence decided upon - and paid for out of our common budget - before Parliament has voted .
it will not , however , be until this afternoon that we know the result , and it is certain that there will be votes both in favour of , and against , the Constitution .
those in favour cannot ste@@ al tax@@ pay@@ ers &quot; contributions to promote a defin@@ ite view .
referendu@@ ms bel@@ ong to us all , and vo@@ ters are entitled to balanced information , not pro@@ pa@@ gan@@ da paid for through tax@@ es .
on Mon@@ day evening , Parliament &apos;s S@@ es@@ sion@@ al Ser@@ vic@@ es decided to send some millions of euro@@ s to the sup@@ ran@@ ational EU parties , which are all in favour of the EU Constitution .
more than 1@@ 50 Members of the European Parliament will not have a share of these resources .
that is contrary to the principle of equality and thus illegal .
I would call upon you to raise the matter in the Council so that the regulation relating to parties is either ab@@ olis@@ hed or suppl@@ em@@ ented by arrangements for those who do not wish to bel@@ ong to a sup@@ ran@@ ational party but wish to eng@@ age in cor@@ respon@@ ding European information @-@ providing activities , for example concerning the Constitution .
how will you guarantee that EU resources used by the campa@@ ig@@ ners for a &apos; yes &quot; vote can be used equally well by the campa@@ ig@@ ners for a &apos; no &quot; vote ?
may I finally call upon you to inti@@ ma@@ te that you will respect the outcome of the referendu@@ ms , whether they be &apos; yes &quot; or &apos; no . &quot;
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there can be no doubt that the most ambitious task facing the in@@ coming Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will be the conclusion of negotiations on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive for 2007 @-@ 20@@ 13 .
this will un@@ ques@@ tion@@ ably be an extremely challeng@@ ing task , but I am in no doubt that everything in our power should be done to reach a compromise on the budget by June of this year at the latest .
otherwise we will risk major dela@@ ys , for example in the drawing up of regional aid programmes , and this could mean EU funds not reaching the Member States in January 2007 .
it is of course not just the date by which we reach a compromise that is of crucial importance , but also the nature of the compromise .
Mr Barroso rightly said that we cannot have more Europe for less money .
the European Union will ce@@ ase to exist without solidarity , and this is why we cannot con@@ sent to either the policy of solidarity or the need to support the new Member States being remo@@ ved from the EU &apos;s budget priorities .
we must be aware that unless g@@ ap@@ s in economic development within the enlarged EU are addressed , it will be impossible to achieve the goals of the Lisbon strategy .
we must therefore ensure that funds are ear@@ mar@@ ked in the future EU budget for cohesion policy , as this is in the interests of the whole Community .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , there can be no doubt that President Bush &apos;s visit to Brussels will be the most significant event to occ@@ ur during the six @-@ month Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
it will be the first time that a President of the United States has ever visi@@ ted the European institutions .
I hope that this symb@@ ol@@ ic visit will go some way to improving transatlan@@ tic relations , which have been somewhat stra@@ ined recently .
unless we cooperate closely with the United States , we will s@@ tru@@ gg@@ le to respond to a great many global challenges .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I welcomed your comments on relations with Ukraine .
the European Union must draw its own conclusions from events last year in one of its neighbour@@ ing countries .
the Ukrain@@ ian people have prov@@ en that they share our European values , and that they desire integration with the EU .
we should therefore offer them a partnership that could ultimately lead to membership .
Mr President , as you know , the European institutions recently - and , I think , disas@@ tro@@ us@@ ly - cut the G@@ or@@ di@@ an k@@ not with regard to the possible accession of a non @-@ European country , Turkey , to the European Union .
an issue of that kind threa@@ ten@@ s to change the very nature of the Union as we know it and even pu@@ ts the future of European cooperation as we know it fundamenta@@ lly at risk .
it is , above all , an issue in respect of which a large majority of our elector@@ ate , our citizens , are very ali@@ en@@ ated from the position adopted by the official European institutions .
I regret , then , the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s failure to take the opportunity , first of all , of asking respect for the democratic will of the majority of our citizens and , secondly , as a small Member State , asking respect for that other small Member State , Cyprus , which is being ig@@ no@@ red and mis@@ jud@@ ged by the Turkish leaders in the most ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant and unacceptable manner .
in my view , this is a mis@@ sed opportunity , and one that can only w@@ iden the enormous ch@@ as@@ m between our citizens on the one hand and European politics on the other .
Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er has described a very ambitious agenda for these next six months ; this agenda off@@ ers a great opportunity , but is also a great responsibility for Luxemb@@ our@@ g and particularly for its Prime Minister , who has both experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task .
I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency , which , in my opinion , will be the reform of the financial perspec@@ tives , which you , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , mentioned in pass@@ ing .
it will probably be the most essential element , on the basis of which these six months will be assess@@ ed .
it is clear that success or failure depen@@ ds not only upon the actions of the Presidency , but it is the case that during this time the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Government will have to emplo@@ y all its determination , and I am pleased that you have stated this morning that you will ensure that the general interest is put first , because , as you have said y@@ our@@ self , to reach July without an agreement would s@@ pel@@ l financial cha@@ os for the European Union .
in order to be successful , the Presidency will have to seek compromis@@ es ; I believe that these compromis@@ es will have to be based on two fun@@ da@@ men@@ tal@@ s : on the one hand , the val@@ id@@ ity of the principle of cohesion , as stated by the Council at the end of the Swedish Presidency , and , on the other , balance in the distribution of bur@@ d@@ ens .
I hope that over the next six months this House can learn the cost of enlargement to the original fif@@ teen Member States , because on the objective basis of figures it is possible to make proposals that the European citizens in each Member State can understand and accept .
on the subject of the citizens , and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties , I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament , which is going to give its opinion in May , to play in this negoti@@ ation ?
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , you recently stated , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , and indeed you repe@@ ated just now , that competitiveness will be neither the H@@ ol@@ y G@@ rail nor the be all and end all as far as you are concerned , in particular with regard to the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon strategy .
you noted that social goals and sustainable development goals should not be placed in opposition to goals relating to competitiveness .
my group wel@@ comes this statement , as we believe the opposite to be true , namely that promotion of the European model is a major dri@@ ving force behind competitiveness on our continent .
in fact , we believe that what is needed is a Europe of excell@@ ence which atta@@ ches priority to investment in research , innovation , employe@@ e training , the quality of infrastruc@@ tures , tr@@ ans @-@ European networks , public services , the quality of work and social relations .
we agree with you on this issue , and we sometimes de@@ te@@ c@@ ted a s@@ light difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission .
we hope that he will be equally clear in his statements , especially with regard to social issues .
yet the good inten@@ tions you have prof@@ ess@@ ed to hold will be put to a number of tes@@ ts .
I should like to mention three such tes@@ ts , the first of which is the European budget .
we share your view that this debate must not be allowed to get bo@@ g@@ ged down and that it must progress ra@@ pid@@ ly .
you intend to act as a mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ting and inter@@ medi@@ ary force , as well as one that acc@@ el@@ er@@ ates the process , but we do not want the process of reaching a compromise on the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives to be acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated if this would mean sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ ing a budget that meet@@ s the European Union &apos;s needs .
we agree with Mr Barroso on this issue ; we need a budget that enab@@ les us to guarantee cohesion , solidarity , investment in the future and in research and investment in the tr@@ ans @-@ European networks .
the process should not be acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated at the expen@@ se of the final outcome .
the second test will be the directive on services of general interest , which has already been mentioned today by a number of speakers , in particular Mr Tur@@ mes .
I believe that you y@@ our@@ self are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us , namely the extended scope of this directive , which poses a threat to a large number of services of general interest .
we are also concerned by the country of origin principle , which poses a threat to the right to work in multi@@ ple countries ; I am thinking in particular of the application of collective bar@@ ga@@ ining agreements .
the third test relates more generally to the European social agenda .
we would particularly like to see a clear commitment on your part in relation to other Council members regarding a review of the Directive on Wor@@ king T@@ ime and a remo@@ val of the op@@ t @-@ out clause , and , finally , regarding a proposed review of the Directive on European Wor@@ ks Coun@@ c@@ ils .
Mr President , on 1 January , Luxemb@@ our@@ g beg@@ an its el@@ ev@@ ent@@ h EU presidency .
the experience it has ga@@ ined in this field , and the excellent prepar@@ ations that have been made and which I have seen for myself , will be a great help in dealing with the various challenges that a@@ wait you , starting with the terri@@ ble disaster in Asia .
the latter show@@ ed that there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid to be coordin@@ ated on the ground , and should encourage us to set up the European V@@ ol@@ un@@ tary Hu@@ man@@ ita@@ rian A@@ id Cor@@ ps , as provided for by the Constitution , as soon as possible .
there are other issues that you will have to deal with , of which I shall only mention three .
firstly , the Lisbon process has reached its hal@@ f@@ way point .
this process needs to be made cle@@ ar@@ er and it needs tar@@ ge@@ ted priorities ; in short , it will need to be made easier to understand .
I am therefore fully in favour of the three aims you identi@@ fied .
the second issue will be the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tive .
it is doub@@ t@@ less to be welcomed that it will be the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency that pu@@ ts the fin@@ is@@ hing tou@@ ches to it , but many people are still un@@ decided between 1 % and 1.@@ 24 % , to say nothing of 1.@@ 14 % - and I could go on - and much money is also han@@ ging in the balance .
finally , the Stability Pact will need to be amended , and the necessary balance found between stric@@ t@@ ness and flexibility to ensure that stability is not compromis@@ ed .
Mr President , I very much hope that your success will be equal to the efforts that have been made by so many people .
Mr President , I would like to wish Prime Minister Jun@@ ck@@ er a positive and productive presidency and am very pleased to see a small , successful , independent country leading the European Union .
Luxemb@@ our@@ g is one of the six Member States that is small@@ er than my own country , W@@ al@@ es , and an example of what an independent W@@ al@@ es could achieve .
the priorities paper tries to maintain the essential balance between economic , social and environmental policies .
I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination , in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gen@@ der In@@ stitu@@ te and on the rec@@ ast equality directive .
there is no better example of the failure of policies on equality than the pay ga@@ p between men and women .
thir@@ ty years after legislation was passed on this issue , a report published this week by the G@@ M@@ B trade union in the UK shows that , in Ang@@ l@@ es@@ e@@ y in my constitu@@ ency , full @-@ time pay for women is as low as 5@@ 9 % of that for men .
this is a s@@ cand@@ al which must be addressed and I hope equality issues will be given priority .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to express my cond@@ ol@@ ences to Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er on account of the death of G@@ r@@ and Du@@ ch@@ ess J@@ os@@ ep@@ h@@ ine @-@ Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te .
I wish you and the Luxemb@@ our@@ g people streng@@ th to bear this los@@ s , and may G@@ od be close to you .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency is facing the w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ty task of re@@ form@@ ing the Stability Pact and implementing the conclusions of W@@ i@@ m K@@ o@@ k &apos;s report .
the Commission &apos;s proposal to give due consideration to the economic climate in the Stability Pact off@@ ers , in my view , a basis for car@@ rying out adequate reforms .
the implementation of the Pact benefits from clear decision @-@ making .
clear sanctions are still needed .
it was in the autu@@ m@@ n of 2004 that Mr K@@ o@@ k presented his report on the Lisbon strategy ; his conclusion is as clear as it is pre@@ dic@@ table : the Member States must really get down to car@@ rying out structural reforms .
I would therefore like to ask Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er in what way we can expect your presidency to follow that up .
since Luxemb@@ our@@ g has always been a great cha@@ m@@ pi@@ on of necessary reforms , I have high hop@@ es .
finally , with regard to the Members &quot; sta@@ tute , can Parliament expect from the presidency that a decision will finally be made on this subject in the next six months ?
thank you , Mr President .
I wish the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency every success . it will be in the interests of us all .
you are the second country to hold the presidency of the enlarged twenty @-@ five .
you are a foun@@ ding state of the European Union and you are also an example of how a small country can set the te@@ mp@@ o and dicta@@ te the conditions to the big countries .
the President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , dre@@ w attention in his speech today to the increased financial pressure on the new Member States , referring to the back@@ ward regions .
I should like to point out that these ten Member States also have great we@@ alth .
many of these regions have been de@@ pri@@ ved of ten@@ s and hun@@ dre@@ ds of young ambitious people , sci@@ ent@@ ists , do@@ c@@ tors , who have left in the last fif@@ teen years for the old Europe and they are contribu@@ ting to their successful econom@@ ies .
I should like to point out to the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency that we do not wish to be just the reci@@ pi@@ ents of char@@ ity .
I see this as an opportunity for you actively to involve the new ten .
following ratification of the Constitutional Treaty , Europe will build new institutions .
I inv@@ ite you to take steps to ensure that the e@@ ast of the European Union is given the right to h@@ ost an important European institution .
I am convinced that this idea could be a success .
evidence of this fa@@ it@@ h is the fact that the Bush - Pu@@ tin meeting is to take place in my little country , Slova@@ kia .
- Mr President , the reform of the Stability Pact and the reform of the financial perspective are two sides of the same co@@ in .
these reforms need to find a common ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y and a common solution : more growth , more competitiveness and more resources for the Member States .
that all means more aff@@ lu@@ ence and more cohesion .
let me be fran@@ k with you , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er .
what you have said on the Stability and Growth Pact is thorou@@ gh@@ ly acceptable , but it is all provided for in the current system of regulation : the autom@@ atic sta@@ bil@@ ising mechanisms , their relationship with growth or rec@@ ession , the relationship between greater defic@@ it flexibility and the effectiveness of deb@@ t dyna@@ m@@ ics - all that is already provided for .
what the European Union needs now is not that , but perhaps we should be more ambitious .
I say more ambitious , but that does not mean less ri@@ goro@@ us , just more min@@ d@@ ful of the strategic needs of our Union .
if we really have to re @-@ establish an effective , Europe @-@ wide strategy for investments , infrastructure , research and security - in short , to meet the targets set at the Lisbon Summit - then we have to reach agreement on the kin@@ ds of action needed : no hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , no di@@ r@@ ty tric@@ ks and no opportun@@ ism .
the Pact needs a European g@@ ol@@ den rule , as one might say , with the appropriate guarantees and controls atta@@ ched .
the financial perspective needs a str@@ onger , not a we@@ ak@@ er Union budget , one that foc@@ uses more on the investments required by the Lisbon objectives and less on han@@ dou@@ ts .
Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , Mr Barroso , will we be capable of that ?
it depen@@ ds on us .
the responsibility res@@ ts with us all , but please let us not have any hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , I would like to focus my brief comments on the financial perspec@@ tives , which , of the challenges that have been mentioned today , are perhaps the most difficult facing this Presidency .
in expla@@ ining your priorities , you say that you accept the reasons why it is necessary to reach a political agreement on the financial perspec@@ tives in June , so that the legislative procedures can be concluded under the British Presidency , re@@ conc@@ il@@ ing national differences .
we wish you lu@@ ck , because , on the one hand , there is the enlargement we have just carried out , with ten new Member States whose economic situation mean that we are going to have to make an enormous financial effort with a view to social and economic cohesion , in order to protect the European social model , as you have stres@@ sed in your speech .
on the other hand , there are the short @-@ si@@ ghted accoun@@ tants , whose s@@ ole aim is not to exc@@ eed a certain level of spending .
we hope that , with your experience and with the cooperation of the European Parliament , your Presidency will per@@ su@@ ade the Council to take a broad@@ er view , and make it see that it is ir@@ responsible to try to create more Europe with less resources - to use once again that well @-@ wor@@ n ph@@ r@@ ase .
but it is also necessary to make the Council see that budgetary policy , Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er , is facing much more important challenges than keeping spending bel@@ ow a particular perc@@ enta@@ ge of gro@@ s@@ s domestic product .
let us continue to build a Europe amongst all of us and with sufficient resources , as laid down in the Treaties , so that we do not disap@@ point the citizens .
Mr President , the new presidency can be assu@@ red that hun@@ dre@@ ds and thousands of British citizens will fight the proposed European Constitution too@@ th and na@@ il , and millions of us will vote against it when the time comes !
we have no quar@@ re@@ l with the people of Europe : our quar@@ re@@ l is only with the system of uni@@ tary government called the European Union .
the EU is the of the accoun@@ table parliamentary democracy that the British in@@ ven@@ ted over 7@@ 00 years ago .
this attemp@@ ted re@@ vers@@ al of the relationship between the State and the individual has been fo@@ is@@ ted on us over the last 30 years by dec@@ e@@ it , den@@ ial and mis@@ repres@@ entation .
but now we understand fully what the EU is really all about .
we may not leave during your presidency , but be in no doubt - leave we shall !
Mr President , the ten@@ or of my speech will be rather different from that of the previous speak@@ er &apos;s .
let me start by thanking the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency , not only for the excellent agenda it has presented , but also for the sty@@ le , content and level of commitment ev@@ ident in it .
in the coming months , the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will certainly have its work cut out , and we have high hop@@ es .
there are great challenges that require an answer and that Europe has to meet .
I should like to bring up one of those challenges , namely more and better jobs , but also sustain@@ ability and social cohesion .
I will therefore repeat to Mr Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s and Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it that the Socialists and the Gre@@ ens do not have s@@ ole ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ition rights in this respect .
social cohesion is very much one of the Christian Democrats &quot; principles , and I will always continue to de@@ dic@@ ate myself , as I know will our group , to ensure that social cohesion is maintained .
that is why I am pleased that not only the President of the Council , but also the President of the Commission and the chairman of my group mentioned it .
I should like to say a few words about Lisbon , and I want to make a number of points .
first of all , while the objective of what we did in Lisbon was sound , and the result we would like to achieve is excellent , we for@@ got that , when all those Heads of Government w@@ ent home , nobody as@@ sum@@ ed any responsibility or li@@ ability for this process .
what matters more than anything else at the moment is , in addition to all the new measures that have to be taken , for people to be made accoun@@ table .
it will then be possible to ver@@ i@@ fy national plans at European level .
I should like to fin@@ ish off with a cr@@ y from the heart .
I have no@@ tic@@ ed that we have made a few agreements about the free market that were subsequ@@ ently f@@ lou@@ ted by the Member States and also by the European Commission , as regards quali@@ fications , mobility , and so on .
Mr President , the Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy is so full of gr@@ and ideas that we often hear very little - and indeed we have heard very little today - about the simple things , such as improving the quality of our own legislation .
the fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to its produc@@ ti@@ vity if its regulatory framework was mat@@ ched by the best in the world .
we should therefore be making it a priority of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to encourage the Commission to put real resources into consul@@ tations at an early stage in its proposals and to test whether its competitiveness is appropriate .
we also need to spen@@ d time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for .
often we pass legislation , but do not look at what it has actually achieved .
is existing legislation being properly en@@ forced and implemented ?
it seems to me that , in the European Union of 25 , implementation en@@ for@@ cement should get far higher priority than it has up until now .
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Pro@@ te@@ ction has taken up my sugges@@ tion that we should have an own @-@ initiative report looking precisely at these issues .
we have also heard considerable talk today about social Europe , but we have to ensure that social Europe applies to every@@ body and not simply to those who are in work .
far too many of our citizens are econom@@ ically in@@ active , and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work .
if we fail to do that , then we will fail in our Lisbon S@@ trate@@ gy .
finally , I urge the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to take f@@ res@@ h initiatives in relation to Nor@@ thern Cyprus so that we can ensure we have effective economic reg@@ ener@@ ation in that part of the country .
Mr President , I should like to begin by wis@@ hing Mr Jun@@ ck@@ er and his country a successful presidency .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , you assu@@ me the lead@@ ership of the Union at a crucial period .
the ratification process for the Constitution is under@@ way , the Lisbon process is not yet making enough progress and the future of transatlan@@ tic relations is a source of concern .
in March , the European Council will conduct the mid @-@ term review of the Lisbon process .
it will do it against the back@@ dro@@ p of the K@@ o@@ k report , which was b@@ l@@ un@@ t in its assessment of the lack of progress .
I urge the presidency not to be dis@@ trac@@ ted by the si@@ r@@ en calls of those who urge that the preser@@ vation of the &apos; European model &apos; is the most important political priority .
it is clearly not . it is precisely because so many governments have failed to g@@ ras@@ p the n@@ ett@@ le of ra@@ dical reform that the Lisbon process is in such di@@ re stra@@ its .
the United States continues to out @-@ per@@ form us and the competitive challenges from Asia , particularly China and In@@ dia , are increasing , with no appar@@ ent urgent response from national cap@@ i@@ tal@@ s in our Union .
the presidency must be une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cal in its support for economic reform , for greater labour market flexibility , for more competitive taxation policies , and for reducing bar@@ riers to employment growth , particularly the excessive regulation that per@@ va@@ des all our econom@@ ies .
with high unemployment a factor across Europe , people are waiting for practical ways of getting them back to work .
reform will be difficult and f@@ ra@@ u@@ ght with risk , but as the United Kingdom , under Mar@@ gar@@ et T@@ ha@@ t@@ ch@@ er in the 198@@ 0@@ s and Spain under Mr Az@@ na@@ r in the 199@@ 0@@ s proved , a resolu@@ te approach to economic reform deli@@ vers results .
low taxation , flexible labour markets , less red ta@@ pe and a determination to ti@@ p the balance firmly in favour of the we@@ alth @-@ cre@@ ators off@@ ers the only way out of a rela@@ tive economic dec@@ line .
these things are naturally an@@ a@@ them@@ a to soci@@ alists but are good for all our citizens .
we look to the s@@ pring Council in March to re@@ ver@@ se the fail@@ u@@ res of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterpris@@ e @-@ dri@@ ven path .
Mr President , the whole issue of children has been inv@@ isi@@ ble in EU policies and programmes .
however , children &apos;s rights are now mentioned in the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
it is important that progress is made towards a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal European policy on children .
children cannot defend themselves . thus it is our obligation to do this .
every day we hear about children who are s@@ tarv@@ ing , d@@ ying or ab@@ used in all possible ways .
however , there is no mention in your programme of a full @-@ scale strategy on children &apos;s rights in accordance with the UN Convention on Ch@@ il@@ dren &apos;s Rights , which was rati@@ fied by most European countries .
children are v@@ ul@@ ner@@ able to trafficking .
the recently published report on trafficking in human beings by the Ex@@ per@@ ts Group has a strong human rights dimension .
I urge the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to take this forward , including a specific legal instrument to promote and protect the rights of children who have been traffic@@ ked .
the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency has stated that a directive on the return of asylum see@@ kers is a priority .
it is important that there is a specific sec@@ tion to protect the rights of children and that un@@ ac@@ compan@@ ied children are not re@@ turned to their countries of origin without an assessment of what is in their best interests .
the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am@@ ing of children &apos;s rights in European Union development policy has not been achieved .
I urge the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency to address this failure without delay by calling for a communication on children &apos;s rights and new development cooperation and by supporting refer@@ ences to children &apos;s rights as a priority .
I further urge it to revis@@ e the development policy statement .
the implementation of new guidelines to safeguard children in conflict areas remains a concern .
in order to ensure progress , it is essential that the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency takes this process forward by compl@@ et@@ ing and putting into practice a plan of action .
in conclusion , it is vital that children &apos;s rights are made a priority of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g presidency and that children &apos;s rights are included in the presidency conclusions .
Mr President , I have no@@ tic@@ ed two short@@ com@@ ings in the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s programme , and I should like to ask two questions with regard to these short@@ com@@ ings .
the document out@@ lin@@ ing the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s priorities men@@ tions 27 countries and regions outside the EU by name , yet E@@ as@@ tern Europe and Ukraine are not mentioned once .
to put it another way , the programme la@@ cks an eas@@ tern dimension .
it would be somewhat al@@ arm@@ ing if this reflec@@ ted the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency &apos;s views and inten@@ tions with regard to the new European democracy that has emer@@ ged before our very e@@ yes and on our very do@@ or@@ step .
the comments made before this House on Ukraine have been very cau@@ ti@@ ous .
they do not imp@@ ly that measures will be taken that are equal to the responsibility which Europe be@@ ars towards Ukraine , and which poses a mor@@ al and political im@@ per@@ ative .
if we were to content ourselves with the old A@@ ction P@@ l@@ an , which was based on the neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy , we would be doing far too little , and we would be making a mis@@ take .
this plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age , before the &apos; O@@ range R@@ ev@@ olution &quot; took place , offer@@ ing hope and a model for peaceful political trans@@ for@@ mation .
the events in Ukraine mer@@ it a re@@ action from Europe , not merely words and out@@ da@@ ted instruments .
time pass@@ es more ra@@ pid@@ ly , and indeed differ@@ ently , in Central and E@@ as@@ tern Europe .
we must act now to ensure that democracy is not merely vic@@ tor@@ ious , but that it is long @-@ las@@ ting and a source of hope to others .
what should therefore be done ?
the old A@@ ction P@@ l@@ an should be revis@@ ed and extended beyond the neighbour@@ ho@@ od policy , and a f@@ res@@ h offer should be made .
the EU &apos;s relations with Ukraine should be advan@@ ced to a new level , and the country should be offer@@ ed an Association Agreement and the pros@@ pect of membership .
we should not th@@ war@@ t Ukraine &apos;s European hop@@ es or trade in our fundamental values , such as freedom , democracy and solidarity , for oil and gas .
by supporting Ukrain@@ ian democracy we will also support the democratic amb@@ itions of the citizens of Belarus , Russia and the other countries of the post @-@ So@@ vi@@ et space .
it is an opportunity for political change that will benefit the European Union in every respect .
the er@@ a of Y@@ alta , of the B@@ re@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v D@@ oc@@ tr@@ ine and of the Berl@@ in W@@ all has en@@ ded .
we need a coura@@ ge@@ ous policy based on our values , not on our financial interests , and promoting democracy , human rights and the right of nations to self @-@ determination .
the for@@ ging of more open relations with a democratic Ukraine is both a great challenge and a great responsibility for the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency .
I wish it every success .
. Mr President , I can take one of two appro@@ ac@@ hes ; I can either answer the 30 Members who have spoken , and risk being very long @-@ w@@ in@@ ded , or I can merely answer a few of them , and risk appe@@ aring extremely im@@ pol@@ it@@ e to the others .
I shall therefore try to be brief in order to be pol@@ it@@ e .
Mr Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s , who has been following my progress closely for many years , believes me to be entirely inc@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of such a thing , and on this point we agree .
Mr President , several speakers have referred to the Lisbon agenda , in particular the group cha@@ ir@@ men and other Members such as Mr Sw@@ ob@@ o@@ da and Mrs O@@ omen .
it would appear that we are more or less in agreement on the need to maintain the fundamental sy@@ nergy on which the Lisbon strategy is based , and which was given a useful bo@@ ost by the conclusions of the Go@@ th@@ en@@ burg European Council .
it has become a ha@@ bit of Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it &apos;s to refer in@@ dis@@ cr@@ im@@ ina@@ tely to auth@@ ors from both sides of the R@@ h@@ ine , and today he quo@@ ted V@@ ic@@ tor Hu@@ go .
with regard to the Lisbon agenda , I should like to quo@@ te P@@ as@@ cal , who said that he lik@@ ed things that go hand in hand .
this hol@@ ds true for a number of areas of life , and it also hol@@ ds true for the Lisbon strategy .
it is impossible to dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish between the various elements that go towards making the Lisbon strategy so effective - and I am talking here of its the@@ ore@@ tical effectiveness , not the en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m with which it is implemented .
a number of you have referred to the much @-@ needed structural reforms that must be carried out in the framework of the Lisbon strategy .
I have been a member of the E@@ co@@ fin Council since 198@@ 9 , I believe .
since then , I have been told week after week and month after month that structural reforms must be carried out , yet it is r@@ are for me to come across anyone who is able to say exactly what these structural reforms should look like .
as a general rule , it is my impression that those who say that structural reforms must be carried out actually mean that the social state must be dis@@ man@@ t@@ led .
this is why it is frequ@@ ently said with regard to structural reforms that labour markets must be re@@ formed and that they need to be more flexible .
I believe this to be true , but I also believe that European emplo@@ yers could be more flexible .
I believe that it would be in the interests of decision @-@ ma@@ kers , who frequ@@ ently also take decisions for others , to prove themselves more flexible in adap@@ ting the to@@ ols we have to modern needs .
I myself do not believe that Europeans should be led to think that it will be enough to reform labour markets , to abol@@ ish existing social legislation and to elimin@@ ate the bu@@ ffer z@@ ones provided by workers &quot; rights in order to become more competitive .
this would be a very short @-@ term approach , with obvious consequences ; we would not gain competitiveness , but we would lose the support of a large number of Europeans , in particular workers .
I should therefore like to war@@ n you against such simp@@ lis@@ tic proposals , which will get us no@@ where .
several of you stated that your groups would support the Stability Pact , and this made the debate extremely interesting .
I shall explain what I mean by this .
Mr Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s , no less , offer@@ ed the support of his parliamentary group , the Socialists .
if I understood him correc@@ tly , Mr C@@ oh@@ n @-@ B@@ end@@ it appears to be moving towards a clear meeting of interests and ideas on this issue .
Mr Poettering promis@@ ed the support of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party .
five minu@@ tes of the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency were therefore all that were needed to see the Socialists , the Liber@@ als , the Christian Democrats and all the others agree on the general sha@@ pe to be taken by the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact .
this is something I welcome gre@@ atly , and in this respect the Luxemb@@ our@@ g Presidency will be stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward ; this was not something I was aware of before today &apos;s sitting .
I shall turn briefly to the Directive on the liberalisation of services , with regard to which I thought I had made my views clear .
we will not reject this Directive , as it could in fact gener@@ ate jobs if we draft it in a way that is appropriate to the situation .
I would like us , however , to join forces to remove everything from this Directive which poses a risk of social du@@ mp@@ ing , and which has cre@@ pt into the text if one read@@ s between the lines .
I am well aware that our discussion of this directive is be@@ de@@ vi@@ lled by con@@ fu@@ sion , because the potential risks posed by a number of its provisions are not obvious .
I should therefore like to call on the Commission , the Council and Parliament to examine this draft directive line by line , se@@ ar@@ ching for any risk of social du@@ mp@@ ing .
after all , given that everyone , including Mr Bolkestein , tell@@ s me that the aim is not to viol@@ ate the rules which protect our labour markets , we should be able to elimin@@ ate the risk of social du@@ mp@@ ing - a risk I believe to be very much present as far as this directive is concerned - by means of a common reading , if this is indeed our overall intention .
