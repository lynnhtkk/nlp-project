I dec@@ l@@ are re@@ su@@ m@@ ed the se@@ s@@ sion of the European Parliament ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed on F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y , 1@@ 5 December 2000 .
st@@ a@@ te@@ ments by the President
ladies and gentlemen , on S@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ day , as you know , an e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a once again , with tra@@ g@@ i@@ c consequences . this is an area which has already been s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted on a number of o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons since the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the t@@ w@@ en@@ ti@@ et@@ h c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
the la@@ te@@ st , pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ al , fi@@ gu@@ res for v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or are already very high . there are 3@@ 5@@ 0 people de@@ a@@ d , 1 2@@ 00 people mis@@ sing , the area is com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly de@@ va@@ st@@ ated and th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of h@@ om@@ es have been d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed throughout the country .
the European Union has already s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n its s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity by s@@ en@@ ding a res@@ c@@ u@@ e te@@ am to the area , w@@ h@@ il@@ st financial assistance from the Union and Member States has been , or is in the process of being , re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d and I am able to in@@ for@@ m you that some groups in the European Parliament have re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed that this issue be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the debate on to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
however , I should like to in@@ for@@ m you that I have , of course , on behalf of the European Union , ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed our s@@ in@@ c@@ er@@ e con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences and de@@ e@@ p@@ est s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y to the President of E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or in the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y which has st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k his country .
I would ask you , as a mar@@ k of respect for the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s and for the im@@ m@@ en@@ se su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing of their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies , to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence .
( the House ro@@ se and ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence )
President .
T@@ ra@@ g@@ ic@@ ally , on 3@@ 1 December , a day that most of us com@@ m@@ em@@ or@@ ate with c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ ra@@ tion , b@@ ec@@ a@@ me a day of m@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ing for the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of V@@ ol@@ en@@ d@@ am , in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , who l@@ o@@ s@@ t 1@@ 0 of their young people on N@@ e@@ w Y@@ e@@ a@@ r &apos; s E@@ ve .
I should like , on behalf of the European Parliament , to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y to the par@@ ents and f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
I should also like to wish the 1@@ 8@@ 0 people in@@ j@@ u@@ red in this a@@ w@@ ful f@@ ir@@ e a s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ y rec@@ o@@ very .
I should not for@@ get that many pla@@ c@@ es , where j@@ o@@ y@@ ful c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ ra@@ tions are also held , are all too often trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed by sa@@ d@@ ness and m@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ing , due to a lack of a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate safety measures .
it is in the same s@@ p@@ ir@@ it that I should like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the 3@@ 0@@ 9 v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of the f@@ ir@@ e at a dis@@ c@@ o in L@@ u@@ o@@ y@@ an@@ g , in C@@ h@@ in@@ a , and I would ask you to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence in h@@ on@@ our of these v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
( the House ro@@ se and ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence )
President .
ladies and gentlemen , I had w@@ is@@ h@@ ed , as everyone had , that we would be able to open our first part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion of the year without having to m@@ en@@ tion further v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of E@@ T@@ A ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m .
unfortunately , on 20 December , J@@ u@@ an M@@ i@@ gu@@ e@@ l G@@ er@@ v@@ il@@ l@@ a , a p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ er in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a , was k@@ il@@ led by ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s .
he had dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ed his k@@ il@@ l@@ ers as they were pre@@ par@@ ing an at@@ ta@@ c@@ k .
his c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ e@@ ous actions unfortunately c@@ o@@ s@@ t h@@ i@@ m his life but un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly also sa@@ v@@ ed many others .
this is why I would like to pa@@ y t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to h@@ i@@ m in particular and I would ask you again to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence .
( the House ro@@ se and ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence )
R@@ e@@ f@@ er@@ ra@@ l back to committee
with regard to the report by Mr C@@ a@@ sh@@ m@@ an on public access to Parliament , Council and Commission d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , for which the vote on the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive resolution was p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed on 1@@ 6 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er , the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs has in@@ for@@ m@@ ed me that it is not yet able to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the two m@@ on@@ th de@@ ad@@ line la@@ i@@ d down in the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
this is why it has re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed that it be re@@ f@@ er@@ red back to committee pu@@ r@@ su@@ ant to R@@ u@@ le 1@@ 4@@ 4 ( 1 ) of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
I shall now give the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to Mr W@@ at@@ s@@ on , C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of this committee , so that he can present the request on its behalf .
Madam President , the House k@@ in@@ d@@ ly agreed on 1@@ 6 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er to a request from the committee which I have the h@@ on@@ our to c@@ ha@@ i@@ r to d@@ el@@ a@@ y the fin@@ al vote on Mr C@@ a@@ sh@@ m@@ an &apos;s proposed le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive resolution .
that d@@ el@@ a@@ y was in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to allow time for the other institutions to consider our amendments and for the Commission to for@@ m@@ u@@ late a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed proposals .
since our N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion , we have had con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with the other institutions , though as yet no agreement has been for@@ th@@ com@@ ing .
therefore , we would ask the House for a pr@@ or@@ o@@ g@@ ation of the d@@ el@@ a@@ y of a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m of two m@@ on@@ th@@ s in order to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the dialogue and , we hope , present to you com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise amendments for v@@ o@@ ting at our part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion on 2@@ 8 F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary .
( Parliament ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the request )
agenda
the next it@@ e@@ m is the fin@@ al d@@ ra@@ f@@ t agenda as d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up by the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents at its meeting of T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day 1@@ 1 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
s@@ it@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ s from 1@@ 5 to 1@@ 8 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g President .
I have received no re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for amendments to the agenda for M@@ on@@ day , T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day or W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day .
Madam President , I would like to point out to my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members and to y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f , that , w@@ h@@ il@@ st I understand the reasons which led you to go over the to@@ p and set such a full agenda for W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day , with regard to the political to@@ p@@ ic@@ s due to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed between 9 a@@ .@@ m@@ . and 4 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , the Council and the Commission have ex@@ ac@@ tly the same s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king time as all the Members of the European Parliament , i@@ .@@ e@@ . 9@@ 0 min@@ u@@ tes for the Council and the Commission and 9@@ 0 min@@ u@@ tes for the M@@ E@@ P@@ s .
I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to have to point this out , as I know we have a very b@@ u@@ s@@ y day on W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day , but let us t@@ r@@ y to change this , as , after all , par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y debate should take p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ence over the institutions .
thank you , Mr D@@ el@@ l &apos; A@@ l@@ b@@ a .
I will , of course , take no@@ te of your com@@ ment .
Madam President , I would like to take up some points made by Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a and also say something about W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day &apos; s s@@ it@@ ting .
not only is W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day &apos; s agenda com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly over@@ bo@@ o@@ k@@ ed , but important reports - such as the S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t report on natural ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s , as well as others - are being h@@ an@@ d@@ led without debate , which is w@@ r@@ on@@ g to my mind .
this can be put down to the dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s decision to c@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ l F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ s , which I would like to take this opportunity to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t .
Madam President , I have re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed the f@@ l@@ o@@ or in order to speak about T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day &apos; s j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate on fisheries .
a major debate has been s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for that day and the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents has dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on the F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies A@@ g@@ re@@ ement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o without a resolution .
as you know , this is a very s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve issue and I would ask you to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy a few things , as the in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of this issue may s@@ om@@ e@@ what d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ t the over@@ all debate .
I would ask you first of all to state at w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e be@@ h@@ est this was in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , in other words , whether it was the Commission itself that made the request or one of the political groups .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the debate &apos; s agenda , the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l course of action would be for the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate on the f@@ our reports to take place and then for the Commission &apos; s st@@ a@@ te@@ ment to be made and a further debate on this to take place .
since it no longer ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s possible for e@@ v@@ ents to take place in this way , because the political groups have already d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted Members &apos; s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king ti@@ m@@ es , I would ask that , in this case , the Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment should be the first it@@ e@@ m so that Members may speak in the debate and so that the Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment is not made in the m@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le of the debate , which would pre@@ v@@ ent all Members from being in an e@@ qu@@ al position to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to this st@@ a@@ te@@ ment by the Commission .
Madam President , I shall be d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to re@@ p@@ ly to Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a .
the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed this Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment - I do not know if any of the other groups made the same request .
this really is the most appropriate time , when we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the future of our fisheries policy on the basis of f@@ our reports , for the Commission to make this st@@ a@@ te@@ ment .
this is the th@@ in@@ king that led the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group to make this request .
thank you , Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o .
Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o has given you your an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
the request was made by the Group of the Party of the European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , but I can in@@ for@@ m you that it was ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly by the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents .
Madam President , I as@@ k@@ ed for c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication ; I have ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly no in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of ar@@ gu@@ ing about the ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ at@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of a Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment . it clearly is appropriate .
I want to make it clear that we support it , and I believe that it was also su@@ p@@ por@@ ted in the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents of political groups , but today I have a meeting with the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary meeting , and this issue will l@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally be de@@ al@@ t with .
as C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of that committee , I w@@ an@@ ted to have all the information so that I could com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ate it to the other committee members .
the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment is therefore welcome . in no way do we op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e it .
far from it . our group has also su@@ p@@ por@@ ted it .
so that the debate may be held in an or@@ de@@ red f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion , which is what most concerns me , because this issue could d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ t the f@@ our important fisheries de@@ b@@ a@@ tes which we have on the agenda , it would be n@@ or@@ ma@@ l for this st@@ a@@ te@@ ment to be made after that debate , and that would then give us time to continue dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing this issue , although it se@@ em@@ s that that will not be possible .
the com@@ p@@ et@@ ent services had in@@ for@@ m@@ ed me that the order of in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions would be as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws : firstly the f@@ our ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s of the reports , and then the Commissioner would be given the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to make the a@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned st@@ a@@ te@@ ment .
in that case , the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s would not be able to re@@ p@@ ly to the Commissioner during the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate .
what I therefore ask is that the Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ment be made first and that then the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers should take the f@@ l@@ o@@ or , so that e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y might have the same right as M@@ E@@ P@@ s to he@@ a@@ r , and be able to re@@ p@@ ly to , the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment by the Commissioner .
Madam President , I wish to in@@ for@@ m Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a that these are the terms of the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , but I see that the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant services have already ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed this to h@@ i@@ m .
the idea - at the request of most group C@@ ha@@ ir@@ men - was that the f@@ our ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s would speak first , and then the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the Commission would follow .
this was what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed in the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , at which I had the h@@ on@@ our of re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing you , Madam President .
Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a &apos; s request is out of place .
Madam President , I would like to ex@@ pla@@ in very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly why my group has tabled this motion which , re@@ la@@ tes to what is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing k@@ no@@ w@@ n , in the French n@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s in particular , as the D@@ an@@ one case .
this is an important issue that g@@ o@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d the l@@ im@@ its of responsibility of one group .
as it ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s , it concerns the policy of a large food pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing com@@ p@@ an@@ y which has rec@@ ently ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed financial results d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed by the p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the com@@ p@@ an@@ y h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f as excellent , and which , at the same time , dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to sh@@ ed 3 000 j@@ o@@ b@@ s and to c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e se@@ ver@@ al s@@ it@@ es in various Member States of the European Union .
it se@@ em@@ s to me that we cannot , on the one hand , make full employment a priority for European Union action and work on d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting a European C@@ om@@ p@@ an@@ y S@@ ta@@ t@@ u@@ te to la@@ y down new rights for em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es and , on the other hand , c@@ al@@ m@@ ly accept this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of strategy , which pu@@ ts the interests of s@@ ha@@ re@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers before e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing .
this is why I pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e an ur@@ g@@ ent debate on this matter .
Madam President , my group will be v@@ o@@ ting in favour of this proposal because , to take up Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z &apos; s ar@@ gu@@ ments , this is not just a French issue , but a European issue , both because of the si@@ z@@ e of the D@@ an@@ one Group and because of the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al re@@ per@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons of the measures proposed in various countries .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , because the European C@@ om@@ p@@ an@@ y S@@ ta@@ t@@ u@@ te has been ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the Treaty of Nice , we feel that this is an extremely to@@ p@@ ical issue and one that also needs to be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed by the Swedish Presidency .
be@@ ar@@ ing in mind the fact that my group has also b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t up the situation of other m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ in@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al com@@ p@@ an@@ ies that op@@ er@@ ate ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s Europe or even wor@@ l@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e in the c@@ a@@ r and st@@ e@@ e@@ l man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , we feel that this issue should be given su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation in the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs .
ma@@ y@@ be this could re@@ place another it@@ e@@ m , because the issue is serious enough to w@@ ar@@ r@@ an@@ t a more in @-@ de@@ p@@ th and de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed st@@ u@@ d@@ y .
Madam President , we do not d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that it is an important issue we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing here , but this is something that c@@ ro@@ p@@ s up time and again .
in the past , we always agreed that we would deal with such issues as part of a more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve debate .
it is therefore in@@ appropriate to in@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ e the ur@@ g@@ ent procedure , particularly as the issue which is to be le@@ f@@ t o@@ f@@ f the agenda , is so important .
I would also like to point out - although I was un@@ able to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents in per@@ s@@ on , o@@ w@@ ing to our European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party C@@ on@@ g@@ res@@ s , my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e , J@@ a@@ m@@ es P@@ ro@@ v@@ an , was there to re@@ p@@ res@@ ent me - that the issue has already been voted on in the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents and so there is no need for it to be raised once again .
we are against in@@ v@@ o@@ king the ur@@ g@@ ent procedure on this issue .
Madam President , first of all , Mr P@@ o@@ et@@ ter@@ ing can be for@@ given for his mis@@ take since he was ab@@ s@@ ent .
however , Mr P@@ o@@ et@@ ter@@ ing , I would like to te@@ l@@ l you that the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents certainly did not vote for or against this motion and it was su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed that I should ta@@ ble this motion in Parliament , which I have done .
regarding the proposal by Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o , I am in com@@ p@@ le@@ te agreement with the proposal to re@@ f@@ er the whole matter , i@@ .@@ e@@ . D@@ an@@ one and si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , to the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs so that we can then con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t a more general debate on this .
I do not n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y wish that this be t@@ re@@ ated as an ur@@ g@@ ent to@@ p@@ i@@ c , but I do think that we should take no@@ te of this gra@@ ve in@@ con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ency which is st@@ ir@@ r@@ ing up con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able fe@@ el@@ ing a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the general public in all our countries , and which , in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , concerns the European Union .
therefore , if all Members are in agreement , I would certainly wish to re@@ f@@ er this matter to the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs .
Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z , should I as@@ su@@ me then that you wish to w@@ i@@ th@@ draw the current proposal to re@@ place it@@ e@@ m 5 in the debate on to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance with this point ?
may I con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de that there is b@@ road con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s on Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o &apos; s proposal ?
I can see that this is the case .
does any Member of the Union for a Europe of N@@ ations Group wish to present the request to re@@ place the it@@ e@@ m with &quot; S@@ it@@ u@@ ation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a &quot; ?
Madam President , you mentioned e@@ ar@@ li@@ er the h@@ or@@ r@@ or@@ s that have been re@@ por@@ ted , which are re@@ la@@ ted to ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , the Union for a Europe of N@@ ations Group w@@ an@@ ted the House to be able to h@@ ol@@ d an ur@@ g@@ ent debate on the situation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , we were all able to w@@ it@@ ness the te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on b@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ a@@ st@@ s of the un@@ be@@ ar@@ able i@@ ma@@ g@@ es of recent ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res carried out in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a by I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ t ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s who k@@ e@@ e@@ p pu@@ sh@@ ing back the l@@ im@@ its of at@@ ro@@ c@@ ity .
we cannot , therefore , understand why Parliament , which is always so particular on human rights issues , should re@@ main si@@ l@@ ent following further e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of f@@ an@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ al ma@@ d@@ ness .
h@@ ol@@ ding this debate would allow us to re@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ m that all the measures that have been adopted in North A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ an countries , A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a in particular , to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t re@@ l@@ ent@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly against ch@@ il@@ d m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ re@@ r@@ s and their ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ic@@ es have the over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing support of the Members of the European Parliament .
we see it as our d@@ u@@ ty to s@@ en@@ d the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an people a m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge of our s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and to encourage the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an Government to implement , with the support of the European Union , the policy in this area that is a@@ w@@ a@@ ited by the va@@ st ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of its citizens , who , like us , are not used to this in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence that is r@@ u@@ in@@ ing their country .
I believe that an@@ y@@ one who has had the opportunity to v@@ is@@ it A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a during recent m@@ on@@ th@@ s or years can make a better as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of what this ter@@ ri@@ ble ou@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ k of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m means to the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an people and , indeed , I believe that it would be to our c@@ re@@ d@@ it if we de@@ al@@ t with this issue in an ur@@ g@@ ent debate .
I therefore believe that this is a good su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion .
Madam President , the b@@ i@@ g problem is that so much is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing on the world stage .
l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ ally , we w@@ on@@ d@@ er why they are not given the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est priority .
this is the case for A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
but then there is also the visa ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation which R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a has un@@ il@@ a@@ ter@@ ally im@@ p@@ o@@ sed on G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a since 5 December 2000 .
w@@ h@@ o@@ ever is ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with the situation ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e region , k@@ no@@ ws that this is a b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing issue , and we can th@@ us ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts to f@@ l@@ are up once again .
our par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y committee has ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly as@@ k@@ ed to p@@ ri@@ or@@ it@@ ise this to@@ p@@ i@@ c , which was sh@@ el@@ v@@ ed last time .
so I think it is only f@@ a@@ i@@ r that we should t@@ u@@ r@@ n the s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on this region , so as to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d conflict at a la@@ ter d@@ ate as far as we can , and also to bring it to the attention of the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an authorities .
Madam President , in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d com@@ p@@ et@@ ition ar@@ is@@ ing between these two issues , would it perhaps be possible to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the situation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a in the &apos; human rights &apos; se@@ c@@ tion , in which case , all the issues proposed could be de@@ al@@ t with .
Madam President , I would like to continue with the subject of the T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day s@@ it@@ ting .
I would like to draw your attention to the plan for T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos; s s@@ it@@ ting , which has the debate on reports con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing after 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . until 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .@@ .
sur@@ pr@@ is@@ in@@ g@@ ly , the report to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed at that time concerns the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , which I tabled for the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y .
after that , at 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , there is the vote on this report , which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts the j@@ o@@ b@@ s of f@@ our million em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es in Europe and com@@ p@@ et@@ ition in this industry and other re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
in my opinion , if we have to debate a report like this one , which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts the j@@ o@@ b@@ s of f@@ our million people , at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , then the plan for T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos; s s@@ it@@ ting has r@@ u@@ n up against very b@@ i@@ g problems as a result of the F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ s being dis@@ con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed .
I know that a few d@@ o@@ z@@ en people at most will re@@ main to vote .
it is de@@ gra@@ ding for Parliament that we should adopt a position on a report on such a w@@ i@@ d@@ e issue with such a small group of Members .
for this reason I would pre@@ f@@ er it if T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos; s e@@ v@@ en@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting could be used just to vote on ur@@ g@@ ent matters , and v@@ o@@ ting con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with ac@@ t@@ u@@ al reports could be s@@ w@@ it@@ ch@@ ed to the agenda for the next B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I draw your attention to the fact that al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing e@@ v@@ ents have been taking place in M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w in the past 2@@ 4 h@@ ou@@ r@@ s , ma@@ in@@ ly a@@ im@@ ed at the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent m@@ ed@@ i@@ a and the freedom of the p@@ res@@ s .
m@@ ed@@ i@@ a @-@ M@@ o@@ s@@ t r@@ un@@ s the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a and its organisation has a number of ra@@ di@@ o st@@ ations and in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ma@@ g@@ a@@ z@@ in@@ es .
Mr A@@ n@@ d@@ re@@ y T@@ si@@ ma@@ y@@ l@@ o , the de@@ pu@@ ty c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of M@@ ed@@ i@@ a @-@ M@@ o@@ s@@ t , was y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed and su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to fi@@ ve h@@ ou@@ r@@ s of in@@ ter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , following which Mr A@@ n@@ t@@ on T@@ it@@ o@@ v , the financial di@@ rec@@ to@@ r of in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , was ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed at the h@@ om@@ e of his mo@@ th@@ er , the d@@ o@@ or having been b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in by the security p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e .
a number of other j@@ uni@@ or em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es of in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on are being ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed and in@@ ter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated as we si@@ t here now .
this is an al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing development and it g@@ o@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d the per@@ s@@ on@@ al question of Mr G@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ s@@ k@@ y , which I have raised before and , as is well k@@ no@@ w@@ n , I am an ad@@ v@@ is@@ er to h@@ i@@ m .
Madam President , could we take this matter into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation ?
you m@@ e@@ t the de@@ pu@@ ty c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of M@@ ed@@ i@@ a @-@ M@@ o@@ s@@ t in J@@ un@@ e , Mr M@@ al@@ a@@ sh@@ en@@ k@@ o .
you s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e to h@@ i@@ m about this problem of government p@@ res@@ sure on freedom of the p@@ res@@ s and you su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed that something should be done .
can we t@@ r@@ y to find some way of con@@ v@@ e@@ ying our v@@ i@@ e@@ ws to the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an Government and s@@ or@@ ting out this question of freedom of the p@@ res@@ s and ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion which b@@ ed@@ e@@ v@@ il@@ s relations between the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation and the European Union ?
Madam President , if I rec@@ all cor@@ rec@@ tly , following the resolution on T@@ un@@ is@@ i@@ a which we adopted in December , President B@@ en A@@ l@@ i was su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to have s@@ ent you , shall we say , a le@@ t@@ ter of c@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ s@@ y .
if this is cor@@ rec@@ t , would you share the con@@ t@@ ents of that le@@ t@@ ter with us ?
I have not received any such le@@ t@@ ter .
if I had , I would n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally have in@@ for@@ m@@ ed the House .
Madam President , in recent d@@ a@@ y@@ s , even as we speak , reports have been f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ ing in of the in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing number of cases of young s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers and many c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans who have f@@ al@@ l@@ en v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m to extremely serious il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by the use of weapons with depleted uranium w@@ ar@@ he@@ ad@@ s .
firstly , Madam President , I am sure we would all wish to s@@ en@@ d our de@@ e@@ p@@ est s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y to the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the young s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , the European c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans and the citizens of the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al R@@ e@@ public of Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a on the death of their l@@ o@@ v@@ ed on@@ es following ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion from NATO sh@@ el@@ l@@ s .
secondly , I must te@@ l@@ l you that I g@@ re@@ at@@ ly welcome your st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on the depleted uranium issue . in particular , I support your call for an ur@@ g@@ ent b@@ an on the use of these le@@ th@@ al sh@@ el@@ l@@ s .
I am quite aware that some people d@@ en@@ y that there is any as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation between the de@@ a@@ th@@ s and il@@ l health and the use of the sh@@ el@@ l@@ s , but I also know that no military a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity is able to pro@@ ve the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary .
therefore , if it is not possible to ob@@ ta@@ in an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate b@@ an , it is essential to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m , for although these sh@@ el@@ l@@ s are not currently in use in war they continue to be used in ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es .
I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that you will pu@@ r@@ su@@ e this matter .
Madam President , at 8 a@@ .@@ m@@ . this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , I f@@ ou@@ n@@ d m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f in the good com@@ p@@ an@@ y of 2@@ 4 other M@@ E@@ P@@ s , st@@ a@@ f@@ f and one Commissioner at S@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ h@@ o@@ l a@@ ir@@ por@@ t .
we were really l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to s@@ pen@@ ding another w@@ e@@ e@@ k in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g after the h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s , but our f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t was c@@ an@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ed , unfortunately .
this is not the first time .
we f@@ ly to S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g with R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al A@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es .
since this a@@ v@@ i@@ ation com@@ p@@ an@@ y was taken over by A@@ i@@ r F@@ r@@ an@@ ce this year , one in two f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts has been c@@ an@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ed .
that means that each time we t@@ r@@ y to make our way to S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , in good s@@ p@@ ir@@ its , we st@@ u@@ m@@ ble ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s yet another h@@ it@@ ch .
today too , we had to f@@ ly v@@ i@@ a P@@ ar@@ is to S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
so , although I was at S@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ h@@ o@@ l in A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am at 8 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , I , al@@ on@@ g with 2@@ 4 others , did not ar@@ ri@@ ve in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g until 4 p@@ .@@ m .
at present , A@@ i@@ r F@@ r@@ an@@ ce is still 1@@ 00 % state @-@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ed , and the French Government has as@@ su@@ red us that it will b@@ end over b@@ ac@@ k@@ w@@ ar@@ ds to make our S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence more be@@ ar@@ able .
that is why I would ask you to pa@@ s@@ s this com@@ pla@@ in@@ t on to the French Government , because we would simply like to c@@ at@@ ch our di@@ rec@@ t f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t to and from A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am every M@@ on@@ day and every T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day on time .
Mrs P@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ i@@ j @-@ v@@ an G@@ or@@ se@@ l , I am extremely concerned by what you have t@@ ol@@ d me and I can as@@ sure you that I shall most certainly con@@ v@@ e@@ y your j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ able un@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s to the appropriate parties .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I wish to draw the attention of the House to an un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent which has o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red since our last part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion , and that is the case of Mr P@@ an@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ s T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s .
many of you may be un@@ aware that part of C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is already part of the European Union because G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in re@@ ta@@ in@@ ed s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n b@@ a@@ se@@ s on C@@ y@@ pr@@ us and Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s was se@@ i@@ z@@ ed from one of those b@@ a@@ se@@ s sh@@ or@@ tly before C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s .
that se@@ i@@ z@@ ur@@ e was an il@@ legal ac@@ t .
Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s is now being held in North C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
I would ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the House to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s its s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y with Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s and his family .
he has been acc@@ used of a c@@ r@@ im@@ e of which I do not think he is gu@@ il@@ ty .
however , w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er the m@@ er@@ its of his case , the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of his ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion were un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
he was ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted from the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of a European Union Member State .
I would ask the President to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our concern to the A@@ n@@ k@@ ar@@ a Government about this in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent and our hope that this un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent will not a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to the C@@ y@@ pr@@ us problem and the peace n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations which are con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing at this moment , and to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our hope that Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s will be re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d as s@@ o@@ on as possible .
Madam President , may I start by sa@@ ying that I agree w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly with what Mr C@@ o@@ s@@ su@@ t@@ t@@ a just said , although that is not why I as@@ k@@ ed for the f@@ l@@ o@@ or .
I as@@ k@@ ed for the f@@ l@@ o@@ or on the matter raised by Mrs V@@ il@@ li@@ ers , in order to dec@@ r@@ y yet another ac@@ t of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m on the part of the Turkish o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ ying for@@ c@@ es in North C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Member has d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es and I need ad@@ d no further de@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
I would just point out that not only was Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted on s@@ o@@ i@@ l b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish b@@ a@@ se@@ s , he was ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted and is being held by the military of a country which is a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate for m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the European Union .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , every a@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e for taking action against Turkey is open to us and I call on you , Madam President , and all my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members of the European Parliament to s@@ how com@@ pa@@ s@@ sion and d@@ em@@ and the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate re@@ le@@ a@@ se of Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s , who is di@@ ab@@ e@@ ti@@ c and un@@ well .
in fact , the whole b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to be a set up , the s@@ ol@@ e pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of which is to ex@@ change Mr T@@ si@@ a@@ k@@ ou@@ r@@ ma@@ s for a Turkish d@@ r@@ u@@ g s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ er ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed by the R@@ e@@ public of C@@ y@@ pr@@ us p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force .
Mr A@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ d@@ ra@@ k@@ is , we shall see what we can do about this .
I l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ed c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y to both your s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h and that made by the Member before you .
with regard to Mr C@@ o@@ s@@ su@@ t@@ t@@ a &apos; s s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , he is aware that I made a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment which fully su@@ p@@ por@@ ts his own s@@ en@@ ti@@ ments .
Madam President , I too wish to ad@@ d to the pro@@ te@@ st@@ s v@@ o@@ ic@@ ed by Mrs V@@ il@@ li@@ ers and Mr A@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ d@@ ra@@ k@@ is at the pre@@ m@@ ed@@ it@@ a@@ ted ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of a C@@ y@@ p@@ ri@@ o@@ t c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en .
not only is this m@@ an il@@ l , but a b@@ a@@ g of ha@@ sh@@ ish was pl@@ an@@ ted next to h@@ i@@ m so that he could be acc@@ used of d@@ r@@ u@@ g s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling , even though the ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion was carried out on a b@@ a@@ se b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in - a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ to@@ r power and a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the European Union .
we need to ac@@ t f@@ a@@ st because I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that , now that Turkey has been acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted as a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate country of the European Union , it th@@ in@@ ks it can ac@@ t with im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity in these matters .
it has already ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed to p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons at two points on the b@@ order with the b@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ er z@@ one in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us , in v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of UN ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , and the pro@@ te@@ st@@ s em@@ an@@ ating from the UN and from us and from the members of Í@@ Á@@ Ô@@ Ï are so in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ al that it pa@@ y@@ s no attention to them w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever .
mo@@ re@@ over , Mr D@@ en@@ k@@ ta@@ s@@ h , the le@@ ad@@ er of &quot; North C@@ y@@ pr@@ us &quot; which , I would re@@ mind the House , is under Turkish o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ pa@@ tion , has re@@ f@@ u@@ sed to take part in further t@@ al@@ ks on the C@@ y@@ pr@@ us problem because he fe@@ el@@ s he is in a much st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er position than before , now that the European Union - without , I believe , a great deal of f@@ o@@ re@@ th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t - has acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted Turkey &apos;s c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ ture for m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the European Union .
Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council - not for the first time , I might ad@@ d - has con@@ tra@@ v@@ en@@ ed the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
the point being that we M@@ E@@ P@@ s have the opportunity , once a m@@ on@@ th , to su@@ b@@ m@@ it a w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en question , for priority con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation which , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e , must be res@@ p@@ on@@ ded to within three w@@ e@@ e@@ ks .
now what we are fin@@ ding is that in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly often , the Council is f@@ a@@ il@@ ing to k@@ e@@ e@@ p to this time sc@@ al@@ e .
here is the la@@ te@@ st example : I su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted a question in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er , to which I have not received an an@@ s@@ w@@ er to this day , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y when is the Council going to get r@@ ou@@ n@@ d to im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the s@@ al@@ ary increase pr@@ om@@ ised to the E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ o@@ l st@@ a@@ f@@ f ?
this is not an is@@ ol@@ ated case , rather such in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es are m@@ ou@@ n@@ ting up .
I would ur@@ ge you to p@@ res@@ s the Council to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
Madam President , I take the f@@ l@@ o@@ or in order to point out yet again - having w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en to you re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly on the matter - that for m@@ on@@ th@@ s now , since 20 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er in fact , h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers li@@ v@@ ing in w@@ re@@ t@@ ch@@ ed conditions in Turkey have been on h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e , which they in@@ t@@ end to see through to the b@@ it@@ te@@ r end - some have in fact already di@@ ed - in a b@@ i@@ d to st@@ o@@ p the Turkish Government from going a@@ he@@ a@@ d with its plan to l@@ o@@ c@@ k them up in is@@ ol@@ ation c@@ el@@ l@@ s in order to b@@ re@@ a@@ k their m@@ or@@ al@@ e and their res@@ is@@ t@@ ance .
we all know what a d@@ ar@@ k day it was for the whole of man@@ kind when the Turkish military and p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e for@@ c@@ es b@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ ally in@@ va@@ ded the pr@@ is@@ ons .
they k@@ il@@ led people .
they fi@@ red on pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
they b@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ ally at@@ ta@@ c@@ k@@ ed the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers pro@@ te@@ st@@ ing ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the j@@ a@@ il@@ s and l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise on h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e .
I think that it is w@@ r@@ on@@ g that n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er we n@@ or the b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u have as yet pro@@ te@@ st@@ ed against this situation in st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er , more c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ical terms ; our si@@ l@@ ence makes the whole of man@@ kind feel that both the European Parliament and the European Union are acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies to this c@@ r@@ im@@ e .
so I ask , even now , that you ra@@ ise your v@@ o@@ ice and make our s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ ies k@@ no@@ w@@ n .
Madam President , with the N@@ e@@ w Y@@ e@@ a@@ r we have le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed through the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish B@@ ol@@ et@@ í@@ n O@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al de@@ l E@@ st@@ ad@@ o that el@@ even p@@ ol@@ ic@@ em@@ en and three gu@@ ar@@ d@@ í@@ as c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ es who had already been s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ ed as t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s had been par@@ d@@ on@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government .
few cases of t@@ or@@ ture are ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , many o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als are pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted because of such ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
in@@ si@@ d@@ e the European Union that is simply not t@@ ol@@ er@@ able .
it is in@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ent upon us to p@@ res@@ s the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government on this issue .
I would ur@@ ge this Parliament to issue a dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation in the c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ st possible terms to s@@ how our st@@ e@@ ad@@ f@@ a@@ st op@@ position to t@@ or@@ ture .
I am sure that you will want to res@@ p@@ on@@ d fully and ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly to this concern .
Madam President , has it been b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to your attention that the Members &apos; re@@ g@@ is@@ ter of interests was last w@@ e@@ e@@ k pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on an In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t s@@ it@@ e , w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 1@@ .@@ co@@ .@@ u@@ k ?
this was not the result of Parliament pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing into practice the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of transparency and op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s , but f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws the c@@ op@@ ying of the rec@@ or@@ ds by a te@@ am in Parliament working for a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on com@@ ed@@ i@@ an .
now that the rec@@ or@@ ds have been put into the public d@@ om@@ a@@ in , will you ad@@ v@@ ise all concerned not to allow Parliament to continue l@@ o@@ o@@ king se@@ c@@ re@@ tive and f@@ o@@ ol@@ ish , but to take s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ y action to bring us into the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y and get the information pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on our own w@@ e@@ b@@ s@@ it@@ e and made per@@ man@@ ently available to European citizens ?
Madam President , I also re@@ g@@ re@@ t that a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish com@@ ed@@ y programme s@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to make li@@ g@@ h@@ t of Parliament and would point out that my own group has , of course , already pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed its re@@ g@@ is@@ ter of interests on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
it re@@ ma@@ in@@ s open to Mr D@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ es &apos; group to follow su@@ it and follow our le@@ a@@ d in pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the re@@ g@@ is@@ ter of interests on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , I agree with h@@ i@@ m .
I think the s@@ o@@ on@@ er this is on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t , the better .
it is a matter of public rec@@ or@@ d .
there is no reason why it should be k@@ e@@ p@@ t se@@ c@@ re@@ t .
that is the point I believe the Q@@ u@@ a@@ e@@ st@@ or@@ s will be ur@@ g@@ ing on the B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future .
c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions
the next it@@ e@@ m is the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for second re@@ ad@@ ing ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 6@@ 9 / 2000 ) , by Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s , on behalf of the Committee on E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y Affairs , on the Council common position for ad@@ op@@ ting a European Parliament and Council directive on the re@@ organisation and w@@ in@@ ding up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions .
Madam President , the European Commission tabled a proposal for a directive on the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of la@@ ws , re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons re@@ la@@ ting to the re@@ organisation and the w@@ in@@ ding @-@ up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions back in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 5 .
that so much time has la@@ p@@ sed , is l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y down to the G@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ al@@ ta@@ r issue .
the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of the directive is to ensure that a c@@ re@@ d@@ it in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion and its b@@ r@@ an@@ ch@@ es in other Member States are re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised or w@@ ou@@ n@@ d up acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of un@@ ity and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al@@ ity .
this means that the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive authorities of the h@@ om@@ e Member State have s@@ ol@@ e j@@ ur@@ is@@ d@@ ic@@ tion in c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out the re@@ organisation or w@@ in@@ ding up of a c@@ re@@ d@@ it in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion and its b@@ r@@ an@@ ch@@ es ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the EU .
this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to all cases , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t where A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 of this directive s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ies o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise .
the a@@ i@@ m of the directive is , th@@ us , not to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise but to ensure e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of all c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s and a con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent approach ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the whole of Europe .
as rapporteur , I can com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy with the th@@ r@@ u@@ st of this report .
in t@@ an@@ de@@ m with the Council and Commission , I have t@@ ri@@ ed to make a few im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents to this report in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of two t@@ y@@ p@@ es of amendment .
the first t@@ y@@ p@@ e is re@@ la@@ ted to the fact that the wor@@ ding of the Council &apos; s common position was not con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent with the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency directive and the directive on the w@@ in@@ ding up and re@@ organisation of in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , which is to be voted on next w@@ e@@ e@@ k within the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Commission .
this kind of dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ y in directives which co@@ v@@ er the same subject matter is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble , un@@ less there is a good reason for it .
as rapporteur , I have taken great pr@@ i@@ d@@ e in r@@ en@@ d@@ er@@ ing legislation on this particularly important subject matter as clearly and trans@@ par@@ ently as possible .
all our amendments per@@ ta@@ in to A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 , which de@@ als with the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions to the r@@ u@@ le .
some amendments bring the directive into line with other directives , such as the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency directive and the w@@ in@@ ding up of in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , as I mentioned a moment ago .
these are A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 20 ( 1 ) ( h ) and 20 ( 2 ) .
by means of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 2@@ 0@@ a to 2@@ 0@@ d , they are r@@ e @-@ in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in the report , but this time by using the same wor@@ ding as in the other two directives .
the second t@@ y@@ p@@ e of amendment per@@ ta@@ in@@ s to the d@@ el@@ e@@ tion of a number of ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions to the main r@@ u@@ le .
these ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions had been wor@@ ded in an a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ gu@@ ous m@@ an@@ n@@ er and were open to in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion .
also , there was the r@@ is@@ k , in the ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le on the re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , that the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion was more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve than the main r@@ u@@ le .
despite this , the ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es on re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , re@@ pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ se ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents and de@@ b@@ t r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ al were in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded as such in the common position .
in the first in@@ st@@ ance , I w@@ an@@ ted to see these ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es d@@ el@@ e@@ ted .
the only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not li@@ ve with com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly d@@ el@@ et@@ ing these ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es .
for this reason , I have t@@ ri@@ ed to re@@ ac@@ h agreement with the Council , and this was done at the el@@ e@@ v@@ ent@@ h h@@ our last W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day .
the com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise still p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es the d@@ el@@ e@@ tion of the three ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es , but three other ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es will be in@@ s@@ er@@ ted in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d .
b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king , the com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es do not pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ice legislation of the Member State to which the con@@ tra@@ c@@ t per@@ ta@@ in@@ s .
these ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es also c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy that the b@@ an@@ k@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ c@@ y rules of the h@@ om@@ e Member State of the c@@ re@@ d@@ it in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion in question are not pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ ed .
that means , therefore , that if con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts are con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded with re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted institutions , the pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ s from those con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts are still in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the e@@ st@@ ate .
that is what this is about , and that was the reason be@@ h@@ in@@ d my or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al proposal to d@@ el@@ et@@ e .
e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is now s@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed out l@@ ou@@ d and clear , everyone is ha@@ p@@ p@@ y and I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that , by j@@ o@@ in@@ ing for@@ c@@ es , we have pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ed a l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation procedure .
we are th@@ us ta@@ b@@ ling two t@@ y@@ p@@ es of amendment .
one t@@ y@@ p@@ e is in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation with respect to other directives , the other d@@ el@@ et@@ ing a number of ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions .
I hope from the bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m of my he@@ ar@@ t that this legislation , which I believe Parliament has u@@ p@@ gra@@ ded in terms of quality , will n@@ e@@ v@@ er have to take effect .
Mr President , the main points of con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ s@@ y in this report concern three different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of con@@ tra@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ al agreement , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y re@@ p@@ o ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted on a re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted market .
as Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s &apos; report ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed , these t@@ y@@ p@@ es of con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts were dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed in committee pen@@ ding this debate and , in e@@ s@@ s@@ ence , what we are se@@ e@@ king to do with the com@@ pr@@ om@@ is@@ es proposed by Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s is to ensure that parties can c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e their own con@@ tra@@ c@@ t law in relation to these particular con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts , but not their own w@@ in@@ ding @-@ up pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s law .
there is a se@@ par@@ ation here between the law of the con@@ tra@@ c@@ t and the external in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency law , because it is quite important to ensure that parties , though they may c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e the law of con@@ tra@@ c@@ t , may not actually c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e their own in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency law .
now a problem ar@@ is@@ es concerning the in@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ tion between the law of con@@ tra@@ c@@ t and in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency law .
what we are t@@ r@@ ying to do is to ensure that the con@@ tra@@ c@@ t op@@ er@@ a@@ tes and w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ s are le@@ f@@ t at the other end are then de@@ al@@ t with acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency law of the h@@ om@@ e State .
there is still one s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y in the te@@ x@@ t about what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s with re@@ g@@ im@@ es , for example , in S@@ pa@@ in which have in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s which k@@ ic@@ k in before the con@@ tra@@ c@@ t law actually ta@@ k@@ es place .
in e@@ s@@ s@@ ence , these are k@@ no@@ w@@ n as a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c st@@ a@@ y@@ s and mean that in certain countries , such as S@@ pa@@ in , I believe all con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts are su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally by an in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing .
I ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s &apos; work in re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing what l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly ir@@ re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ able and com@@ ing up with a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion that f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s h@@ om@@ e State control which is pre@@ f@@ er@@ able in terms of the internal market , but I have some an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y that there will still have to be some fin@@ e @-@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ing .
I hope that we will not have to have a third re@@ ad@@ ing , but we may have to just to make it ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly clear that these a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c st@@ a@@ y@@ s would not a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts , re@@ p@@ o con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in a re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted market .
I would ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the House that in some w@@ a@@ y@@ s it is more important to get a clear an@@ s@@ w@@ er than to get one that su@@ its everyone ; one that is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly per@@ f@@ ec@@ t in every respect .
because with a clear an@@ s@@ w@@ er people can ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge their t@@ r@@ an@@ sa@@ c@@ tions ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the framework that we have set up .
it is v@@ it@@ al to do that .
I ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d the work that Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s has done and I hope that we have finally s@@ or@@ ted this issue out .
I just have certain wor@@ ri@@ es about the a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c st@@ a@@ y@@ s and su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t that we might need some fin@@ e @-@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ing at a la@@ ter stage .
the other con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al issue in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es right in re@@ m and the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence between the common position and the ti@@ d@@ ying up op@@ er@@ ation that Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s has done , and this is something we have dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed at l@@ en@@ g@@ th .
in e@@ s@@ s@@ ence , there is a l@@ o@@ t of common g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d between what the Council pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses in the common position and the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve wor@@ ding that Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s has proposed .
I am in@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ed to think , in view of the un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y , that it may well be wor@@ th st@@ ic@@ king to the common position on that particular issue , because of the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al th@@ re@@ at that it might p@@ o@@ s@@ e to the m@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ age b@@ on@@ d market .
this is not a st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c interest to me as a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish M@@ E@@ P , because it does not a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish market in any way - it is much more important for the D@@ an@@ ish , the A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ an and the G@@ er@@ m@@ an m@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ age market .
I would congratulate Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s on her work .
it is a very good report .
there are still one or two small points of con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ s@@ y in it , but she has done an excellent j@@ o@@ b .
I ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ise for the con@@ f@@ u@@ sion we have had in committee over the v@@ o@@ ting and I am g@@ la@@ d that it has all been res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed now .
Mr President , I do not feel that I will need the full fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ tes , h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly this will allow you to s@@ p@@ e@@ ed up pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s t@@ on@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s as rapporteur on this report which , as Mrs V@@ il@@ li@@ ers has already ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed , has been extremely com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated .
the issue has long been pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c , ma@@ in@@ ly because of the national di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences at g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l level , rather than the issues di@@ rec@@ tly or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ating from Parliament , but com@@ pr@@ om@@ is@@ es pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in Parliament have been both e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent and ex@@ p@@ ed@@ i@@ ent in terms of their approach and are very welcome .
in an e@@ f@@ for@@ t to provide for e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the EU , the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of un@@ ity and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al@@ ity are the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l p@@ il@@ l@@ ar@@ s , of course , of this report , and co@@ h@@ er@@ ence and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ency are therefore at@@ ta@@ in@@ ed .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly the rights of c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s in Member States other than their own are sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ded by the as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es of cooperation between the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant authorities in the Member States , but let us be clear , in case some of you have not re@@ a@@ d the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , this is not about h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation , it is about m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of Member States &apos; re@@ organisation measures and w@@ in@@ ding up procedures .
Parliament &apos;s su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s in in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al proposal is important .
there are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding of European citizens &apos; interests and rights ; indeed this report h@@ el@@ p@@ s c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy many of the el@@ em@@ ents , such as the de@@ p@@ o@@ si@@ t guarantee s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
but , of course , many of the ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the common position which finally c@@ a@@ me back to us have to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , as they re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t many of Parliament &apos;s concerns , although some work has still to be done .
it is therefore s@@ en@@ si@@ ble for Parliament , w@@ h@@ il@@ st acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment &apos;s in@@ t@@ en@@ tions , to re@@ im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e our priorities from the first re@@ ad@@ in@@ g@@ s but to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise and also c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons em@@ an@@ ating from this te@@ x@@ t .
amendments N@@ o@@ s 1 and 2 bring the te@@ x@@ t into line with the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency regulation and the in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce w@@ in@@ ding @-@ up proposals which had already been agreed last su@@ m@@ m@@ er : this con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ s Parliament &apos;s de@@ si@@ r@@ e , therefore , to see a de@@ g@@ re@@ e of co@@ h@@ er@@ ence in this matter .
I also see great st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th for c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s in A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 3 , 5 and 6 while rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ ing that other national d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations , especially in my group , may have other concerns in this area .
but I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally o@@ f@@ f@@ er my support to the idea of b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing this directive in line with the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency regulation and the in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce w@@ in@@ ding @-@ up proposals .
it se@@ em@@ s to me that , finally , in the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing amendments , following in the tra@@ d@@ ition of ti@@ d@@ ying up te@@ x@@ ts for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication , Parliament &apos;s rapporteur has ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed the t@@ y@@ p@@ e of quality we have come to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t from ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed Members .
w@@ h@@ il@@ st issues such as n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing se@@ e@@ m to have been s@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ted in as an ex@@ t@@ r@@ a s@@ er@@ ies of amendments , what we have here is a wor@@ k@@ a@@ ble d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of se@@ c@@ ur@@ ing support in the House and pro@@ v@@ o@@ king serious discussion within the Council .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed that the directive on the re@@ organisation of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions is long over@@ due , which is also why we welcome it .
a uni@@ form procedure is at last to be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed and there is to be co@@ h@@ er@@ ence between the re@@ organisation procedure and the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency regulation .
we would do well to st@@ res@@ s that the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s &apos; rights , in particular , are of c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al importance here , since they establish the principle of pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s with information , as well as the conditions g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing pa@@ y@@ ments made to them .
in this way , all c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s , including those in countries other than the h@@ om@@ e Member State , are gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment under the w@@ in@@ ding up procedure , and a con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent approach .
although the te@@ x@@ t in its current form is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly excellent , some c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
th@@ us , for example , the all @-@ important principle of uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al@@ ity was st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed by a s@@ er@@ ies of amendments in committee , and se@@ ver@@ al areas of in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ bility with the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons re@@ la@@ ting to financial con@@ g@@ l@@ om@@ er@@ a@@ tes , and which could le@@ a@@ d to legal un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y , were ir@@ on@@ ed out .
you will already have no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed in the course of the debate that we di@@ f@@ f@@ er on one point , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in relation to A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 3 and 5 .
the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d@@ ence between the re@@ organisation and w@@ in@@ ding up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions and in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce com@@ p@@ an@@ ies is not de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble for all aspects .
opinion di@@ f@@ f@@ ers on this because we believe what we are t@@ al@@ king about here are different products , and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es different mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , and that different products and different mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts should be t@@ re@@ ated di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ently , and not a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally the same .
the common position is well @-@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed to my mind and was im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed on , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , by the committee &apos; s amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur , Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I would like to thank .
the te@@ x@@ t ou@@ g@@ h@@ t , therefore , to be adopted without d@@ el@@ a@@ y and trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed by the Member States .
I re@@ g@@ re@@ t that the dis@@ pu@@ te in the Council has led to this being d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ ed by more than a dec@@ ad@@ e .
I would point out that the Commission &apos; s first proposal was pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed as e@@ ar@@ ly as 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 5 and Parliament &apos; s first re@@ ad@@ ing was held back in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 7 .
the reason I st@@ res@@ s this is because we con@@ st@@ an@@ tly dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the b@@ al@@ ance between the European institutions in our de@@ b@@ a@@ tes - particularly in the w@@ a@@ k@@ e of the Nice European Council - and in many cases dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s how the procedures ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be acc@@ el@@ er@@ ated .
this does not just apply to Parliament , which is often the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion given in the public ar@@ en@@ a , although we would , of course , do well to con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ate and acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate quite a few procedures of our own too .
but this is not about ap@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ ing b@@ la@@ me .
however , d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less the opinion @-@ for@@ m@@ ing and decision @-@ making process in the European Council o@@ f@@ f@@ ers the best b@@ e@@ t for acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the procedures between the European institutions .
that has been made c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al clear again here .
the Commission proposal is de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to ensure that a c@@ re@@ d@@ it in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion and its b@@ r@@ an@@ ch o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es in other Member States can be re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised and w@@ ou@@ n@@ d up acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the principle of un@@ ity and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ al@@ ity .
that is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed under this proposed directive .
Mr President , the market and national authorities have been l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to the directive on the re@@ organisation and the w@@ in@@ ding @-@ up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions com@@ ing into effect for some time now .
this directive , in fact , a@@ im@@ s to provide a guarantee with regard to the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions which , in an or@@ g@@ an@@ ic m@@ an@@ n@@ er and in a way which is s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally ta@@ il@@ o@@ re@@ d to the sector , g@@ o@@ ver@@ n the institutions , the as@@ se@@ ts , the rights and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s relations when a b@@ an@@ k , which is ac@@ tive in different EU Member States , g@@ et@@ s into di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty or g@@ o@@ es under .
this directive s@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ he@@ ad@@ s the action plan for financial services .
in its common position , e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed by qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , the Council dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed a dis@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ ing and k@@ e@@ en in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t into the specific ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s of the b@@ an@@ king sector which set it a@@ part from the re@@ st , both in terms of the in@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ency procedure in general and com@@ pa@@ red to other financial se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , such as the in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s and the st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and s@@ ha@@ res industry .
this is why A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 of the common position g@@ r@@ an@@ ts the b@@ an@@ king sector special t@@ re@@ at@@ ment on a number of s@@ co@@ res .
this special t@@ re@@ at@@ ment does not in any way pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ice the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y and l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ c of a set of rules for the financial services as a whole .
quite the re@@ ver@@ se , in fact ; it does j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to the specific ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s of b@@ an@@ king , th@@ us g@@ i@@ v@@ ing a better guarantee for st@@ ability and legal c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y .
the report by Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s , on which I would like to congratulate her on behalf of the Commission , and in respect of which I would like to en@@ d@@ or@@ se the com@@ pl@@ im@@ ents ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded by Mrs V@@ il@@ li@@ ers and Mr S@@ k@@ in@@ n@@ er , which w@@ el@@ comes the common position for the most part , pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses a number of amendments to A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 , as was ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed e@@ ar@@ li@@ er this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
the Commission can ap@@ pro@@ ve the pu@@ r@@ por@@ t of these amendments , b@@ ar@@ r@@ ing one .
it ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , at least in principle , to A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 with regard to re@@ pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ se ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
after all , it is of key importance that the b@@ an@@ ks know in ad@@ v@@ ance what legislation will g@@ o@@ ver@@ n re@@ pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ se ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
as it ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s , Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s , on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group , has tabled fi@@ ve new amendments .
these amendments draw the amendments adopted by the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y Commission together in a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er which does j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to the special position of the b@@ an@@ king sector .
under a different gu@@ ise , the new amendments take into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation the specific re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments which are p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed in the b@@ an@@ king sector with regard to n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , re@@ pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ se ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents and ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents and t@@ r@@ an@@ sa@@ c@@ tions within re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
the Commission can go al@@ on@@ g with the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of these amendments , as is ap@@ par@@ ent in its ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment .
if the fi@@ ve new amendments are adopted by this Parliament , the Commission can as@@ s@@ ent to the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of all amendments proposed in Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s &apos; report , including A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 .
however , the wor@@ ding of all amendments - and I am also making this point in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to com@@ ments made by Mrs V@@ il@@ li@@ ers - would then have to be ad@@ ap@@ ted in order to guarantee the com@@ pa@@ ti@@ bility and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ency of these amendments with A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will be taken t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
si@@ m@@ pl@@ er legislation for the internal market ( S@@ L@@ I@@ M )
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report by Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n on behalf of the Committee on L@@ e@@ g@@ al Affairs and the In@@ ter@@ n@@ al M@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ t on the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the re@@ view of si@@ m@@ pl@@ er legislation for the In@@ ter@@ n@@ al M@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ t .
Mr President , red ta@@ p@@ e within D@@ u@@ t@@ ch industry a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts to n@@ e@@ a@@ r enough EUR 9 b@@ il@@ li@@ on per an@@ n@@ u@@ m . this was re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds last w@@ e@@ e@@ k by A@@ c@@ ta@@ l , the n@@ e@@ w@@ ly for@@ m@@ ed Committee of E@@ x@@ per@@ ts on the ver@@ i@@ fication of ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive b@@ ur@@ d@@ en@@ s .
the a@@ ver@@ age ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r s@@ pen@@ ds ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly t@@ en h@@ ou@@ r@@ s on com@@ p@@ le@@ ting ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive ta@@ s@@ ks and for@@ m@@ s .
the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , as far as this is concerned , is no ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion .
re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that un@@ necessary b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c procedures within com@@ p@@ an@@ ies account for 4 to 6 per c@@ ent of the G@@ N@@ P of EU Member States .
this is a he@@ a@@ v@@ y b@@ ur@@ d@@ en , which h@@ its small com@@ p@@ an@@ ies particularly h@@ ar@@ d .
I know of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s who have quite con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed against further ex@@ p@@ an@@ sion of their b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses because they want to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d having to take on st@@ a@@ f@@ f at all costs .
many are de@@ ter@@ red by the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive red ta@@ p@@ e involved .
in this way , the many ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations im@@ p@@ o@@ sed by governments on ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s h@@ in@@ d@@ er the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of production and employment .
some of the time , it is not even the legislation which is w@@ r@@ on@@ g or in@@ effective , but it is often the acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ tion of ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations which makes the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive p@@ res@@ su@@ res so he@@ a@@ v@@ y , and the European Parliament con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tes to this in its own way .
this re@@ min@@ ds me of a report we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed last year which re@@ la@@ ted to the working conditions on con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion s@@ it@@ es .
one of the pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons in that report , th@@ an@@ ks to an amendment in Parliament , per@@ ta@@ in@@ s to h@@ ol@@ ding a la@@ d@@ d@@ er while s@@ om@@ e@@ one is st@@ an@@ ding on it .
quite a@@ part from the ab@@ sur@@ d@@ ity of such pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons , one w@@ on@@ d@@ ers who su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently m@@ on@@ it@@ or@@ s com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with this kind of legislation .
one of the key problems in our com@@ p@@ le@@ x society is pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly the fact that we pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce far too many re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions in such ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance and of such com@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ity , that we ourselves are no longer able to m@@ on@@ it@@ or their com@@ p@@ li@@ ance .
the consequences can be dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s , as a recent in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds pro@@ v@@ ed once more .
in my opinion , the he@@ a@@ v@@ y ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive b@@ ur@@ d@@ en on citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with the government &apos; s in@@ c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity to ensure com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with the t@@ an@@ g@@ led w@@ e@@ b of rules , are reason enough to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of legislation and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of its quality he@@ a@@ d @-@ on .
while I welcome the S@@ L@@ I@@ M pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , which the Commission la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 and which is under discussion this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing , as I st@@ a@@ ted in my report , it is too little too late .
com@@ pa@@ red to the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive ma@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y as a whole , it is only a d@@ ro@@ p in the o@@ c@@ e@@ an .
that is why I ar@@ gu@@ e in favour of ad@@ ded m@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ m , as well as sh@@ or@@ ter implementation per@@ i@@ od@@ s for the results of the S@@ L@@ I@@ M working parties and , ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , for the organisation and man@@ power re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in this respect .
however , I at@@ ta@@ ch yet more importance to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying legislation in its en@@ ti@@ re@@ ty .
particular attention will need to be pa@@ i@@ d to the way in which legislation is de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed .
after all , it is much e@@ a@@ si@@ er to take si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying measures in the e@@ ar@@ ly st@@ ag@@ es than to ad@@ ap@@ t ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing legislation la@@ ter on , at great c@@ o@@ s@@ t , also for b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
every available e@@ f@@ for@@ t must be made e@@ ar@@ ly on to la@@ y down high @-@ quality legislation and to re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ t the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive and financial consequences to a min@@ im@@ u@@ m .
the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds has seen the recent in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of A@@ c@@ ta@@ l , which I mentioned a moment ago . A@@ c@@ ta@@ l is an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent w@@ at@@ c@@ h@@ d@@ o@@ g w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e d@@ u@@ ty it is to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine d@@ ra@@ f@@ t le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals and to ex@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e any n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive b@@ ur@@ d@@ en@@ s on behalf of citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
an excellent initiative which , I hope , will be c@@ op@@ i@@ ed li@@ b@@ er@@ ally in other Member States and at EU level .
I would make an ur@@ g@@ ent ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the European Commission to make a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m e@@ f@@ for@@ t to improve the quality of legislation and to re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ t the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive b@@ ur@@ d@@ en on citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
if the current situation con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es for much longer , the European Parliament , too , will need to consider the consequences of le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed here on citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
if others f@@ a@@ i@@ l to come up with the g@@ o@@ od@@ s , we might have to follow in the f@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ st@@ e@@ p@@ s of the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an C@@ on@@ g@@ res@@ s and set up a s@@ er@@ v@@ ice ourselves which ma@@ p@@ s out the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive and financial consequences of legislation .
Mr President , Commissioner B@@ ol@@ k@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ in , ladies and gentlemen , the si@@ m@@ pl@@ er legislation for the internal market initiative is one of the most important pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses now under@@ way in the Union .
at least for my par@@ ty in F@@ in@@ land , the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al C@@ o@@ al@@ ition , the st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing of legislation and an end to the n@@ e@@ ed@@ less ch@@ ur@@ n@@ ing out of directives b@@ ec@@ a@@ me one of the main objectives in the last European Parliament el@@ ec@@ tions .
I believe that much v@@ al@@ u@@ e is at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to this approach in many other qu@@ ar@@ ters too .
the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the present state of the S@@ L@@ I@@ M pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t is very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying , but by no means fully a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , as yet .
it is v@@ it@@ ally important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t &apos; s third and f@@ ou@@ r@@ th p@@ ha@@ ses into clear le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals as s@@ o@@ on and as e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y as possible .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the si@@ x @-@ m@@ on@@ th de@@ ad@@ line proposed by the rapporteur should be taken s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
I w@@ ar@@ m@@ ly support our rapporteur &apos; s proposals that the u@@ s@@ ers of the legislation - the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ ers of our decision ma@@ k@@ ers - should be he@@ ar@@ d more than they have been when con@@ c@@ re@@ te proposals are being d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted .
only this s@@ or@@ t of co@@ regulation can fully s@@ er@@ ve to s@@ p@@ e@@ ed up the development of the European internal market , and , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly , guarantee that con@@ su@@ m@@ ers actually do b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from legislation projects and the ad@@ op@@ tion of the e@@ ur@@ o .
proposals al@@ one are ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly not enough : they must also be able to be pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sed s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ tly both in Parliament and in the Council .
we do have de@@ b@@ a@@ tes on s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ ing up the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive process from time to time here in Parliament .
we members of the Committee on E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y Affairs in particular a@@ w@@ a@@ it with interest the proposals by the L@@ a@@ m@@ f@@ al@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ y working par@@ ty on new c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses of action that are to be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in the future , at least with regard to legislation on financial services .
although their in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report was still not very de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed , it n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s g@@ i@@ v@@ es us to understand that the working par@@ ty is p@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ ing a procedure in which only the b@@ ro@@ ad@@ est policy issues would be s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed through a full @-@ sc@@ al@@ e c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on procedure , while for other amendments to directives of a more technical nature the f@@ a@@ st @-@ tra@@ c@@ k procedure would apply .
in principle , I take a positive view of such proposals , although it is no@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly difficult for us par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ans to re@@ l@@ in@@ qu@@ ish power .
I believe that the re@@ l@@ in@@ qu@@ is@@ h@@ ment of power in certain res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts will be in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able to re@@ mo@@ ve the fin@@ al b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers to the internal market as s@@ o@@ on as possible .
my fin@@ al position , and that of my group , will su@@ re@@ ly de@@ pen@@ d on what form the f@@ a@@ st @-@ tra@@ c@@ k procedure will take .
in no case should it be an im@@ it@@ ation of the present com@@ it@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y procedure , where there is a very great need for reform , especially in the area of transparency .
our rapporteur also re@@ f@@ er@@ red to this .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the general development of the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive process , I also a@@ w@@ a@@ it with interest the Commission &apos; s w@@ h@@ ite pa@@ per on g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance it is d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting for the G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it .
w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er the Commission pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses in its pa@@ per will de@@ ter@@ min@@ e how qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly new projects for legislation are de@@ al@@ t with , and , how effective the Union is as a whole for a long time a@@ he@@ a@@ d .
h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , the pa@@ per will con@@ ta@@ in good , con@@ c@@ re@@ te proposals , but I also hope that we can still put some e@@ f@@ for@@ t into the S@@ L@@ I@@ M pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
Mr President , it is clear that im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the quality of legislation is essential to the effective f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing of the internal market and to in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity of the European ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
so we all welcome the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative , but we must all share the rapporteur &apos;s res@@ er@@ va@@ tions about how it has wor@@ k@@ ed so far .
there are sur@@ pr@@ is@@ in@@ g@@ ly few areas which have been subject to the S@@ L@@ I@@ M process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted .
we need , without a d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , a f@@ a@@ st @-@ tra@@ c@@ k procedure to t@@ u@@ r@@ n S@@ L@@ I@@ M op@@ in@@ i@@ ons into le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals , because it all se@@ em@@ s to take rather a long time .
so we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the A@@ d@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y Committee and we welcome the rapporteur &apos;s su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion that it should have more resources .
clearly we also need greater s@@ y@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y between the different Commission initiatives for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing legislation .
we s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es think that the different par@@ ts are op@@ er@@ ating in is@@ ol@@ ation .
and , of course , we need greater cooperation between Member States and to over@@ view best practice and se@@ e@@ k to re@@ p@@ e@@ at best practice el@@ se@@ where .
and finally , it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to ensure ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of the u@@ s@@ ers of this legislation , particularly b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , because they know best how this legislation a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts them .
however , having said that , you could quite con@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ va@@ b@@ ly pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce w@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ ful , si@@ m@@ p@@ le legislation , yet it could be com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by the way that Member States implement it and en@@ force it .
we must understand that there are three st@@ ag@@ es of legislation - for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ tion , implementation , including trans@@ position , and en@@ for@@ c@@ ement - and we have to see the process as a whole .
we often find the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st problem is not the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al legislation but how it has been trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed by Member States and the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed at which they have trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed it , how they have im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted it and how they have en@@ for@@ c@@ ed it .
I am often quite sur@@ pr@@ ised by how re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y si@@ m@@ p@@ le i@@ d@@ e@@ as are t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed into the most com@@ p@@ le@@ x n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ ma@@ res as we go through that process .
as part of this on @-@ going de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation by the Commission to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y legislation , I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and , particularly , in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement with the people who have pr@@ im@@ e responsibility for en@@ for@@ c@@ ing the legislation , who are often local and regional ac@@ t@@ or@@ s .
so we must consider the whole process when we d@@ ra@@ f@@ t the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al legislation .
in some w@@ a@@ y@@ s , you could ar@@ gu@@ e , we should start at the end and look at how we en@@ force it and then work b@@ ac@@ k@@ w@@ ar@@ ds as a way of g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing si@@ m@@ pl@@ er legislation .
but the S@@ L@@ I@@ M process ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to go much further .
we need a r@@ ol@@ l@@ ing programme which will co@@ v@@ er all legislation and look at si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying , con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ating , r@@ e @-@ c@@ a@@ st@@ ing , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es re@@ p@@ e@@ al@@ ing legislation .
s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es we may need to go for the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o , but we need a more d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c process than we have had so far .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I share the rapporteur &apos; s concern about the fact that e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently , European institutions are un@@ able to issue trans@@ par@@ ent , re@@ ad@@ il@@ y acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ble re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions which are clear and under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ able to people with a@@ ver@@ age I@@ Q levels .
all c@@ re@@ d@@ it to Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n , who has man@@ ag@@ ed to put his fin@@ g@@ er on the problem .
it should be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted , ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly so , that EU citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses consider com@@ p@@ le@@ x legislation and red ta@@ p@@ e to be e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of a lack of e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency within the institutions .
the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses are ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous .
as long as the Commission does not adopt a clear , c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed approach to S@@ L@@ I@@ M , the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative re@@ ma@@ in@@ s an ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise with no st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed .
it should be an@@ y@@ th@@ ing but that .
in my opinion , two g@@ o@@ als need to be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t into f@@ o@@ c@@ us , in addition to the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations which are currently in the report .
first of all , the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative must be l@@ ent a b@@ in@@ ding ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter , particularly with EU enlargement on the h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on .
secondly , Member States must , as of now , set a good example by gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing a cor@@ rec@@ t , but above all , ti@@ m@@ el@@ y trans@@ position of European directives into national legislation .
all too often , we have been under the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that the process of si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication , which is so c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , is much like a pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion of E@@ ch@@ ter@@ n@@ ac@@ h .
pen@@ ding the Union &apos; s enlargement , we must sh@@ i@@ f@@ t up a g@@ e@@ a@@ r if we want to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the internal market in a prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ ally responsible m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that the Member State which I have the h@@ on@@ our of re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing here , has re@@ al@@ is@@ ed that special measures need to be taken , as is the case in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y legislation in a con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed of the need for si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fied legislation , the L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al Group will be l@@ en@@ ding the D@@ o@@ or@@ n report its un@@ qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied support .
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by sa@@ ying that although I have been al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated f@@ our min@@ u@@ tes , I should like to do my b@@ it for the si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication and st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y by s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king for less than h@@ al@@ f that time .
I congratulate the rapporteur on h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting such a very important issue and also h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting the f@@ a@@ il@@ u@@ res of the Commission to get to g@@ ri@@ p@@ s with it th@@ us far .
I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give ad@@ ded ur@@ g@@ ency to what is such a very important programme .
however , rather than c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done , rather even than re@@ f@@ er just to the f@@ our com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es involved in this particular issue , I should like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t one issue the rapporteur also raised , which is that it is really en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly up to us , as Members of this House , to ensure that legislation is better in the first place .
he w@@ on@@ de@@ red to what ex@@ t@@ ent legislation should d@@ el@@ ve into de@@ ta@@ il@@ s and g@@ a@@ ve an example in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing people h@@ ol@@ ding la@@ d@@ d@@ ers .
that particular subject c@@ a@@ me up in the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs .
it must be said that this particular committee has con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted very si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly to the ex@@ t@@ r@@ a b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y that we are now pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing the b@@ u@@ c@@ k to the Commission to t@@ r@@ y and re@@ d@@ u@@ ce .
how much better it would be if that committee , and indeed all other com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es , had le@@ f@@ t such legislation al@@ one in its si@@ m@@ pl@@ er and pu@@ re@@ r form in the first place .
my fin@@ al su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion is that for us the ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m S@@ L@@ I@@ M - &quot; S@@ im@@ pl@@ er L@@ e@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tion for the In@@ ter@@ n@@ al M@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ t &quot; - should re@@ p@@ res@@ ent &quot; S@@ u@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally L@@ e@@ s@@ s In@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ence by Members . &quot;
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of legislation in the internal market that were la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 are very welcome .
an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t was made there to improve the quality of legislation , to t@@ r@@ y to c@@ u@@ t down on su@@ per@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ous legislation and to l@@ im@@ it the costs as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing legislation .
now that we have fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed the third and f@@ ou@@ r@@ th p@@ ha@@ ses , with te@@ a@@ m@@ s of Member State o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als and u@@ s@@ ers i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying con@@ c@@ re@@ te su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y legislation , it is right that we have a re@@ view .
we need to have c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r defin@@ it@@ i@@ ons of what is going on .
im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed s@@ el@@ ec@@ tion at the moment se@@ em@@ s to be f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly r@@ an@@ d@@ o@@ m and we need some clear gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es for the op@@ er@@ ation of the management te@@ a@@ m@@ s and , of course , the implementation of re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations which , at the moment , are too little and too late .
many of the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations are not im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted at all and many have to w@@ a@@ it con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able per@@ i@@ od@@ s of time .
so we are in favour , but there are two things we want to ad@@ d .
firstly , we have to ensure that political control re@@ ma@@ in@@ s with the Commission and Parliament .
recent p@@ res@@ s reports on the new approach to legislation d@@ ating from the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s and &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s - not so new now - which al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed the de@@ ta@@ i@@ l of legislation to be wor@@ k@@ ed out by industry @-@ led st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation organisations , se@@ e@@ m to in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate that this is not always the best way forward .
the European Committee for S@@ t@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation , for example , rec@@ ently did work on the pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ g@@ ing of w@@ a@@ st@@ e directive , which the p@@ res@@ s has d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed as &quot; f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally f@@ la@@ w@@ ed , under@@ min@@ es d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ bility and f@@ a@@ il@@ s to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds of the directive or , for that matter , environmental protection . &quot;
so we need to ensure that there is political control there , un@@ less of course there are st@@ r@@ on@@ g political or con@@ su@@ m@@ er p@@ res@@ su@@ res to ensure that industry makes progress .
however , we would also wish to go further in a different di@@ rec@@ tion .
S@@ L@@ I@@ M se@@ em@@ s to have become f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally about si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication , even though in the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al proposals we t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about l@@ im@@ it@@ ing costs .
what we would like to see are proposals for de@@ al@@ ing with ec@@ on@@ om@@ y of legislation as well as si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity .
we therefore welcome the proposals from L@@ is@@ b@@ on for better regulation , which will look at the costs of legislation ; we welcome the in@@ for@@ ma@@ l meeting of min@@ is@@ ters of public ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion held in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g on 7 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er ; we welcome the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of the high @-@ level group to look at re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations on making legislation more c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ effective ; but we are dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted that the pr@@ om@@ ised European Parliament re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive on that high @-@ level group has not been ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by Parliament n@@ or , as far as I understand , have we been ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ ed to ap@@ point such a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive .
we welcome the fact that C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers B@@ ol@@ k@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ in and L@@ i@@ i@@ k@@ an@@ en are l@@ o@@ o@@ king at various p@@ il@@ o@@ t projects in this area .
however , the Commission and Parliament will have to be@@ g@@ in to ac@@ t on their own rules in l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the financial im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals in order for them to be taken into account .
it can only de@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e our work in the European Parliament if c@@ la@@ im@@ s can be made , for example , that the end @-@ of @-@ v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le @-@ life directive will c@@ o@@ s@@ t us £ 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ m a year in terms of the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers and the con@@ su@@ m@@ ers but will only d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er £ 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ m a year of b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it to the environment .
while such c@@ la@@ im@@ s can be made , ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly we in this Parliament will look rather l@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ r@@ ou@@ s .
Mr President , I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n , on this particularly con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive and well @-@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed report .
it under@@ l@@ in@@ es the need for st@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ing up our j@@ o@@ in@@ t efforts in order to improve the quality of new and ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing Community legislation - with good reason .
I therefore welcome the support l@@ ent to the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative , as well as the support s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n by this Parliament .
our re@@ view of the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative and this report have d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted where and how the initiative can be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , in t@@ an@@ de@@ m with the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the Member States , we are , in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to making and im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing important re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations under the w@@ ing of a n@@ e@@ w@@ ly e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed internal market A@@ d@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y Committee .
with the fi@@ f@@ th and su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ent st@@ ag@@ es of the S@@ L@@ I@@ M in mind , we are currently con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons with regard to se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s which could be due an over@@ ha@@ u@@ l .
any su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion from this Parliament are , of course , welcome .
as s@@ o@@ on as agreement has been re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed on a sh@@ or@@ t@@ l@@ is@@ t of se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s which can be over@@ ha@@ ul@@ ed , we will con@@ ta@@ c@@ t re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s world , con@@ su@@ m@@ er organisations and trade uni@@ ons , all re@@ f@@ er@@ red to as the so @-@ called &apos; con@@ su@@ m@@ ers &apos; , every st@@ e@@ p of the way .
that should o@@ f@@ f@@ er them the opportunity of con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting to the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative , either di@@ rec@@ tly or in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , and of being in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of the progress made .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that this approach will allow all those taking part in this over@@ ha@@ u@@ l ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on the key issues of si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication , and that the S@@ L@@ I@@ M te@@ a@@ m@@ s will be making re@@ le@@ v@@ ant and p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations .
I am therefore l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to re@@ por@@ ting on the progress made during the next c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
as you know , the Commission is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to su@@ b@@ m@@ it proposals to the best of its ability within si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s of rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations of the S@@ L@@ I@@ M te@@ am , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed that these are re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations which it can su@@ b@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to .
we will make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l this commitment , and I am ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws in particular with this st@@ a@@ te@@ ment .
we are th@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ ed with Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n &apos; s re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations that Parliament and the Council will each as@@ su@@ me their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , by c@@ a@@ re@@ fully con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing all proposals in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , so as to ensure that the S@@ L@@ I@@ M initiative r@@ un@@ s as s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ly as possible .
I share Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n &apos; s view that an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing number of le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive areas should be si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fied .
I am with h@@ i@@ m on that one .
I , too , would like to see this ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
that is , of course , only possible within the con@@ fin@@ es im@@ p@@ o@@ sed by other priority d@@ u@@ ti@@ es and within the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y sc@@ op@@ e available .
I would like to under@@ line this point .
the Commission rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es many re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s .
the Commission has many d@@ u@@ ti@@ es , but it does not always have the means available to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l these d@@ u@@ ti@@ es f@@ a@@ st and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
that is an important matter which also m@@ er@@ its much attention in this Parliament .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , I have no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we can acc@@ el@@ er@@ ate the si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication process , not least as a result of the work in which the Commission itself is involved .
in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the ap@@ p@@ e@@ al made at the European Council in L@@ is@@ b@@ on , to re@@ ac@@ h a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated policy so as to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive c@@ li@@ ma@@ te , the Commission is currently su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ting its position on legislation in general to a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation in the w@@ i@@ d@@ est s@@ en@@ se of the wor@@ d .
it is ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing areas where non @-@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es could be in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
mo@@ re@@ over , it is p@@ res@@ sing for the development of better w@@ a@@ y@@ s of g@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ ing the effect of n@@ e@@ w@@ ly proposed legislation on the b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s world and industry , so as to min@@ im@@ ise possible ex@@ t@@ r@@ a ex@@ pen@@ se and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive red ta@@ p@@ e .
an en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion was also su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
the efforts which are now being made to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t better legislation co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e with pre@@ par@@ ations for the w@@ h@@ ite pa@@ per on better management .
I am m@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ ing this particularly for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of Mrs K@@ a@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ i .
the Commission &apos; s work will be com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted by the results of the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons held in a high @-@ level working group on better legislation , which was con@@ v@@ en@@ ed by min@@ is@@ ters of the P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c Office following their meeting in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er last .
it is this working group &apos; s d@@ u@@ ty , and Mr F@@ or@@ d called for attention to be given to this , to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the quality and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of both national and Community legislation .
I am already l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to the report and the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations of this working group .
this le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive process for which we all c@@ ar@@ r@@ y some responsibility , concerns us all , of course .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that the current political con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s in aid of a better le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive c@@ li@@ ma@@ te within the European Union will le@@ a@@ d to real and per@@ man@@ ent im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents .
I would also like to thank Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws for the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve m@@ e@@ an@@ ing he g@@ a@@ ve to the ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m S@@ L@@ I@@ M , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y &apos; S@@ u@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally L@@ e@@ s@@ s In@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ence by Members &apos; .
I am very gra@@ te@@ ful to h@@ i@@ m for that .
I will t@@ r@@ y to qu@@ o@@ t@@ e this at the appropriate place and time , and those w@@ h@@ o@@ m the c@@ a@@ p f@@ its can w@@ e@@ a@@ r it .
on a fin@@ al no@@ te , I would like to let Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n and your Parliament know that the amendments are acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to the Commission .
thank you very much Commissioner B@@ ol@@ k@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ in , as u@@ su@@ al , for your h@@ el@@ p@@ ful re@@ mar@@ ks in this debate .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will be taken t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education
the next it@@ e@@ m is the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for second re@@ ad@@ ing ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 7@@ 5 / 2000 ) , by Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te , on behalf of the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t , on the Council common position for ad@@ op@@ ting a European Parliament and Council re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on European cooperation in quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 1@@ 1@@ 5@@ 4@@ 0 / 1 / 2000 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 5@@ 6@@ 5 / 2000 - 2000 / 0@@ 0@@ 2@@ 2 ( C@@ O@@ D ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , the quality of education is high on the political agenda of every Member State , and that comes as no sur@@ pr@@ ise .
the third m@@ il@@ l@@ en@@ n@@ i@@ u@@ m o@@ f@@ f@@ ers un@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ n opportunities and pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts within a society which is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly more aware , more g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al , more mo@@ b@@ il@@ e and more k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve , but at the same time where the concern about different s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ s and opportunities for people is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly ap@@ par@@ ent , because how does one ensure that everyone can f@@ un@@ c@@ tion fully in this new d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c society ?
education must and can help here , and all these new de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments o@@ f@@ f@@ er education opportunities and ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es , because education will under@@ go a se@@ a of change , and that is only the way children are ta@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t , and how they are ta@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t to le@@ ar@@ n .
consider , in addition , te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y and the different c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res .
that is why it is so important that the EU Member States j@@ o@@ in for@@ c@@ es and want to work together on future @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ ted education , each acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to their own tra@@ d@@ ition but , let there be no mis@@ take , with a common g@@ o@@ al in mind .
as rapporteur , I am th@@ us d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted with the results of the common position as it is now before us .
in@@ it@@ i@@ ally , I f@@ ou@@ n@@ d the Commission proposal s@@ om@@ e@@ what va@@ gu@@ e and very non @-@ com@@ m@@ it@@ ta@@ l , given the h@@ u@@ ge importance of s@@ ou@@ n@@ d education , and the Council was su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from stage f@@ right : w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er you do , do not t@@ ou@@ ch our a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y in education .
however , in the course of the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons , they c@@ a@@ me to share Parliament &apos; s opinion that the quality of education should be m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly and in a st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red m@@ an@@ n@@ er by , a@@ m@@ on@@ g other things , se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up s@@ ou@@ n@@ d , e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent quality evaluation systems for pr@@ im@@ ary education , se@@ con@@ d@@ ary education and se@@ con@@ d@@ ary v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al training .
the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations are now clear in the amendments tabled by the M@@ E@@ P@@ s and m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f as rapporteur .
in these , we st@@ i@@ pu@@ late clearly that Member States must de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p trans@@ par@@ ent quality evaluation with high @-@ quality education as the key g@@ o@@ al .
this was not in the first Commission proposal , and n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er was the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of social in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion .
o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing e@@ qu@@ al opportunities to bo@@ y@@ s and g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s , that was also h@@ ar@@ d to s@@ el@@ l .
it was difficult to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce the Council to adopt this wor@@ ding , but as rapporteur , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that both the Council and Commission are now in agreement with this .
another as@@ p@@ ec@@ t which was c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to my he@@ ar@@ t is that par@@ ents , pu@@ p@@ il@@ s and te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers too should be involved in the process .
this , too , has now been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , and this is important for the support st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of evaluation pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses and im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in education .
it is also important to encourage sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate at national and European level .
however , I believe that sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s should not be pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted from l@@ o@@ o@@ king for s@@ ou@@ n@@ d cooperation par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in their im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s within the region , and , in my opinion , this idea could have been given more of an a@@ ir@@ ing in the report .
finally , I should like to under@@ line the importance of c@@ ol@@ la@@ ting information and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s and re@@ f@@ er@@ ences , and of en@@ ter@@ ing these in a d@@ a@@ ta@@ b@@ a@@ se which can be con@@ su@@ l@@ ted in@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
that is the m@@ od@@ er@@ n way of com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ating .
it b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me p@@ le@@ a@@ sure per@@ s@@ on@@ ally as rapporteur to see that the Member States have g@@ o@@ t down to work both in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ently and under the re@@ m@@ it of the Commission and have set up a working committee of ex@@ per@@ ts that has de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed a l@@ im@@ ited number of in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s and b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks .
Parliament will be monitoring the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y .
Mr President , Commissioner , the common position as it is now before us is the result of s@@ ou@@ n@@ d and con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on , but particularly th@@ an@@ ks to the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w M@@ E@@ P@@ s who have d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red their com@@ ments with great c@@ are , the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation has become a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d , well @-@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ ting one , which Member States can now start to use .
I am in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed to he@@ a@@ r your re@@ action .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by th@@ an@@ king Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te for the work she has done and I welcome the f@@ r@@ u@@ it@@ ful cooperation that has de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , the ou@@ t@@ come of which is the te@@ x@@ t that has just been p@@ res@@ en@@ ted to us , a te@@ x@@ t which , I hope , will make a real contribution towards pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing the high quality education throughout Europe we as@@ p@@ ir@@ e to .
on behalf of my committee , the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs , I would particularly like to st@@ res@@ s the importance of im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the quality of te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing in sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al training , and se@@ e@@ king to implement a system for ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing good practice and m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical to@@ ol@@ s . these are w@@ a@@ y@@ s of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing social cohesion and re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing un@@ employment .
high quality education systems must st@@ ri@@ ve to achieve objectives , such as to get people into the la@@ b@@ our market , to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of young people le@@ a@@ v@@ ing sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l e@@ ar@@ ly , our ability to provide life @-@ long le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing and to give people access to the new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es .
I must h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t two points in this quality evaluation as s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fied in the common position .
first of all , this process makes a clear d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion between ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive evaluation and the in@@ no@@ va@@ tive procedures that we would like to see and that we would like to implement and in which , as has been said , all st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers must take part .
the second point which I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t has perhaps not been fully taken on bo@@ ar@@ d , as we would have w@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
what we do not want to do is to t@@ u@@ r@@ n the quality evaluation process into a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r for e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fication or le@@ ag@@ u@@ e ta@@ ble of sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , this form of evaluation should allow each e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment , however different in terms of its st@@ u@@ d@@ ents or the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s or resources used , to m@@ e@@ e@@ t all the r@@ is@@ ks of d@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ing out , to improve the in@@ t@@ r@@ in@@ si@@ c quality of education for everyone and to accept all pu@@ p@@ il@@ s of all ab@@ il@@ ities by o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing education which is ta@@ il@@ o@@ re@@ d to the st@@ u@@ d@@ ents &apos; re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments and by al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing everyone to dis@@ co@@ v@@ er their own per@@ s@@ on@@ al development needs .
Mr President , this report is st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group .
indeed , we have su@@ p@@ por@@ ted it throughout the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e procedure .
we re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ted that in@@ it@@ i@@ ally there was some s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t res@@ is@@ t@@ ance from the Council but we are very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that , as a result of st@@ r@@ on@@ g in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion by the Commissioner and the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s of the rapporteur , a com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise was re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed last a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n that we can certainly support .
we congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that .
we certainly all agree here in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er that education is of v@@ it@@ al importance and that an ed@@ u@@ c@@ ated wor@@ k@@ force is the cor@@ n@@ er@@ st@@ one of Europe &apos;s future pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
therefore , any at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to improve st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds in our sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s must be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed with open ar@@ m@@ s .
we also all agree that education is ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly a matter for the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States and the regions .
but there is ro@@ o@@ m for the Commission to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate and improve evaluation systems as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for in the Treaty and I was g@@ la@@ d to see that the Commission was c@@ a@@ re@@ ful to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that this is to be based on v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y cooperation between the Member States .
certainly , at the moment it is difficult to get past each country &apos;s various ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation systems and te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ies to re@@ ac@@ h any objective com@@ par@@ is@@ on of the te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds of the countries .
as a for@@ m@@ er le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , I would have w@@ el@@ com@@ ed a clear idea of how B@@ r@@ it@@ ish te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing and ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds com@@ pa@@ red to those of other European countries .
it is important in this g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al age to have as b@@ road an in@@ put as possible for the evaluation system .
European com@@ par@@ is@@ ons will s@@ how up , one h@@ op@@ es , st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ s but also w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses that are currently h@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ en by evaluation systems l@@ im@@ ited to a s@@ in@@ g@@ le ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al system .
one of the main a@@ im@@ s of education is to provide for the world of work as well as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing a cultural b@@ a@@ se for Europe &apos;s young people .
this report se@@ e@@ ks a b@@ al@@ ance between the need for a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate pre@@ par@@ ation in both those fi@@ el@@ ds .
the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of com@@ par@@ ing education systems ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s b@@ or@@ d@@ ers will , I hope , le@@ a@@ d to im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s European te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ments as sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s le@@ ar@@ n from others ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e their im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate view .
the point made by Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te about social ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion is particularly v@@ al@@ i@@ d .
I would like to see whether there are di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n of the sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l day , whether this v@@ ar@@ ies in different par@@ ts of Europe , and whether this o@@ f@@ f@@ ers w@@ a@@ y@@ s of im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing education .
then there is the use of com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y s@@ por@@ ts ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities : does this help in the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al system of different countries ?
do different countries have different p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s ?
we would all be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed to know how the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al systems achieve com@@ p@@ et@@ ence in two m@@ od@@ er@@ n l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es in addition to the mo@@ th@@ er t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
I su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t my own country will not do so well there but perhaps we would do better on the use of information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
finally , I would just like to say that the rapporteur &apos;s amendments c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for greater s@@ el@@ f @-@ evaluation and participation of st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers in@@ s@@ er@@ ts a v@@ al@@ u@@ able co@@ g in the evaluation ma@@ ch@@ ine .
the opinion of those within the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al system is often l@@ o@@ s@@ t within the large civil s@@ er@@ v@@ ice ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es and b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es which r@@ u@@ n sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
we must find w@@ a@@ y@@ s which give power back to the sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and to the par@@ ents and to the st@@ u@@ d@@ ents because that is where responsibility should li@@ e .
Mr President , Commissioner , education is as@@ su@@ m@@ ing an ever more important role in the European strategy .
the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed the importance of education both in im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion .
it is only natural that the quality of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education should rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve attention also at Union level , although the organisation of education itself is the responsibility of the Member States .
we need Europe @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e cooperation and en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement in all areas of education .
s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c quality evaluation in education is still in its in@@ f@@ an@@ c@@ y in many EU countries .
in F@@ in@@ land , for example , there were legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed on it as part of national ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al legislation just two years ago .
a report on the subject pre@@ pa@@ red in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i last w@@ e@@ e@@ k s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that evaluation is not yet a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c in nature , although it has g@@ o@@ t o@@ f@@ f to a b@@ r@@ is@@ k start .
the report points out , for example , that com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve and high sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education has not pa@@ i@@ d a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate attention to cooperation between pu@@ p@@ il@@ s , their par@@ ents and the or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ers of education .
the importance of including pu@@ p@@ il@@ s and their h@@ om@@ e b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d in decision making is certainly wor@@ th be@@ ar@@ ing in mind .
education cannot just be l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed at from the l@@ im@@ ited point of view of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
there must be ro@@ o@@ m for different s@@ or@@ ts of t@@ al@@ ent , but , at the same time , we have to ensure that the others re@@ main in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded .
education has a major part to pla@@ y in b@@ u@@ il@@ ding an e@@ qu@@ al and in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted society .
well @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use .
in my opinion , sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s must be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in such a way that all children st@@ ar@@ ting their com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y education can achieve su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
that is why the evaluation of quality cannot just f@@ o@@ c@@ us on results , which give a n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w p@@ ic@@ ture of the situation .
education is not just about information and s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ing , but also per@@ s@@ on@@ al development , in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e , for example , of a he@@ al@@ th@@ y s@@ en@@ se of s@@ el@@ f @-@ wor@@ th .
it is a positive si@@ g@@ n that a common position on the quality evaluation of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education is re@@ ad@@ y to be ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te , Commissioner R@@ ed@@ ing and the Council all d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve the c@@ re@@ d@@ it for this .
we are making good progress with this important issue .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , education is one of those areas of com@@ p@@ et@@ ence which is very much part of what g@@ o@@ es on in a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , and so it should be .
this com@@ p@@ et@@ ence must be carried out as c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y to the population as possible , and that means that there will pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly n@@ e@@ v@@ er be a need for a general European education system .
but it is ex@@ ac@@ tly because education is so important in the pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing on , not only of k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and in the ac@@ qu@@ is@@ ition of s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s , but it is also in the pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing on of cultural heritage and in the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al into the social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c that s@@ ou@@ n@@ d education is v@@ it@@ al .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , we p@@ our h@@ u@@ ge a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts of money into education and yet , there is an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing need for European quality monitoring . that is why we would like to l@@ end our support in this matter .
par@@ ents know that education re@@ qu@@ i@@ res a h@@ u@@ ge e@@ f@@ for@@ t from children and st@@ u@@ d@@ ents , but at the same time they ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to see results .
in the ol@@ d d@@ a@@ y@@ s , ma@@ y@@ be att@@ en@@ ding a good sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l was su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent , because it en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed our i@@ d@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical t@@ r@@ u@@ st .
that c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion is no longer enough on its own , and has not been for a long time .
par@@ ents want quality education , and children who att@@ end sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l want to actually le@@ ar@@ n what is important in life .
each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment .
what it did le@@ a@@ d to in F@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ers is a high level of s@@ el@@ f @-@ evaluation in the sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s . they s@@ en@@ sed of their own acc@@ or@@ ds that they n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to make a st@@ and in the world of education .
it has also led to in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing levels of c@@ are and concern ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the b@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
in F@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ers , quality monitoring used to be a b@@ it of a ta@@ bo@@ o subject , for example , for it was fe@@ a@@ re@@ d that this would b@@ re@@ ed h@@ o@@ st@@ il@@ ity in the different ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks . we now see that the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite is t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
the de@@ si@@ r@@ e for quality monitoring in education has op@@ en@@ ed up the d@@ o@@ or to this large European Community and to the j@@ o@@ b market of this European Community . quality monitoring has th@@ us in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly become a common area of concern .
today , I can s@@ how you the results of an en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y which was held ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the F@@ l@@ em@@ ish education system to ch@@ ec@@ k whether both pr@@ im@@ ary and se@@ con@@ d@@ ary education m@@ e@@ e@@ t the common st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds .
it is quite st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ ing how much m@@ ed@@ i@@ a attention this en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y received , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because they know that par@@ ents , st@@ u@@ d@@ ents and the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing environment s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ ise these results . after all , each sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l , each ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al n@@ et@@ work , w@@ an@@ ts to come out of this en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y s@@ m@@ el@@ l@@ ing of ro@@ ses , but at the same time , each par@@ ent w@@ an@@ ts their children to att@@ end good sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
it has come to my attention that the world of education has been com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing about a lack of resources . after all , not only do we want our children to do well at sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l , we also want their sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s to be well e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed , the en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ments to be sa@@ f@@ e , in other words the infrastructure to be up to sc@@ ra@@ t@@ ch .
unfortunately , a great deal of resources are still n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in many countries in order to achieve this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her work .
I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education to be important in this age of information .
the European education systems must become att@@ un@@ ed to the information society .
ra@@ p@@ i@@ d s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical change , together with g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation , d@@ em@@ and su@@ per@@ i@@ or ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds .
we need an education system that can e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ t to ra@@ p@@ i@@ d de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in m@@ od@@ er@@ n society .
what con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a good sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education these d@@ a@@ y@@ s ?
is it about im@@ par@@ ting k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise ?
there is more to it than that .
I believe it is the role of education in terms of the s@@ el@@ f @-@ re@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al and his or her participation in a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c , s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ally just and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant society that is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to the defin@@ ition of a high quality education .
young people must be given the opportunity to ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ e ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic and social com@@ p@@ et@@ ences at sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l .
everyone is ent@@ it@@ led to a good sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education , and that g@@ o@@ es for f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als and groups on the f@@ r@@ in@@ ge of society too .
they are particularly at r@@ is@@ k of social mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ is@@ ation because they are not as well ed@@ u@@ c@@ ated .
I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that everyone rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es the same st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of education .
the social di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e between the in@@ for@@ m@@ ed and the un@@ in@@ for@@ m@@ ed must be b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ged .
quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed for two reasons . firstly , I regard the evaluation as a way of in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ is@@ ing people to improve sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education , and secondly , it ra@@ is@@ es a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the quality d@@ im@@ en@@ sion in education systems .
the Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education , because this is of c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al importance to la@@ b@@ our market policy and the free movement of workers within the EU .
in addition , organisations and as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations working in the field of quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education should co@@ op@@ er@@ ate at European level .
we need European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks so as to be able to o@@ f@@ f@@ er m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al support and to get the external evaluation process o@@ f@@ f the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
after all , sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations , and organisations can le@@ ar@@ n from one another by ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing information and ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences and so find ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing a good education .
I am com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the idea of pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing a good education , as a way of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing un@@ employment and social ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion .
a high @-@ quality education is an in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in the future , for the sa@@ k@@ e of social progress , a p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I said by way of in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion , back in the debate held on 5 J@@ u@@ ly on &quot; quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education &quot; that the f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations for the future of young people are la@@ i@@ d in c@@ la@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s , but not just in c@@ la@@ s@@ s@@ ro@@ om@@ s .
there are no two w@@ a@@ y@@ s about it , education , i@@ .@@ e@@ . training and further education , must take c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e stage in all policy areas .
education is not an end in itself but is the key to our being able to h@@ ol@@ d our own in the m@@ od@@ er@@ n age , not just in economic terms but also at a per@@ s@@ on@@ al level .
the trans@@ ition to the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ based society , the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , social , d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c and environmental change , together with far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the world of work , due not least to the new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es : these are the b@@ i@@ g ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es we f@@ ac@@ e in the third m@@ il@@ l@@ en@@ n@@ i@@ u@@ m , and they also re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ed efforts in the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al field .
so again , I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House , because its a@@ i@@ m is both to improve sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education and the quality evaluation th@@ e@@ re@@ of .
quality com@@ par@@ is@@ ons - be they internal or external - g@@ en@@ er@@ ate com@@ p@@ et@@ ition , and if the quality of education in European sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s is en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ed as a result , and the three @-@ f@@ ol@@ d ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge p@@ o@@ sed by the information society , g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and ra@@ p@@ i@@ d s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical change is taken into account , then this report will have ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed its g@@ o@@ al of g@@ i@@ v@@ ing r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ed im@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ s to efforts in the field of education , and a major st@@ e@@ p forward will have been taken at European level .
so let us help to ensure that the report on implementation , which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years &apos; time , pro@@ v@@ es su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
per@@ m@@ it me though , on a fin@@ al no@@ te , to say something that is f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l to the future of education , since I have just come from an ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ si@@ u@@ m , the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of the A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ an P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party .
there is more to education than e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ing people for employment .
its g@@ o@@ al must be the all @-@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d development of young people as in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als .
this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s im@@ par@@ ting f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s and com@@ p@@ et@@ ences , com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ating v@@ al@@ u@@ es , and ed@@ u@@ c@@ ating people in m@@ u@@ si@@ c , c@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ ve su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , health and s@@ por@@ t .
secondly , a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge b@@ a@@ se , which im@@ par@@ ts important ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al and le@@ a@@ v@@ es out what is un@@ important , still for@@ m@@ s the basis for education in the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
so it f@@ al@@ l@@ s sh@@ or@@ t of the mar@@ k to say that k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and information ou@@ g@@ h@@ t only to be ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed from the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
those who do not have b@@ a@@ si@@ c k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge do not know where to ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ e k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge either .
the cultural te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es of re@@ ad@@ ing , c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ting and w@@ r@@ it@@ ing form part of this k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge b@@ a@@ se .
the new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es o@@ f@@ f@@ er new opportunities to ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ e k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y our cultural te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es .
only those who have a k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge b@@ a@@ se know how to h@@ an@@ d@@ le k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge pro@@ per@@ ly , and how to d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish and di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ate , in an age that has seen an ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ sion in k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
that is why I feel this report makes a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant contribution to pla@@ c@@ ing the ac@@ qu@@ is@@ ition of k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge at the he@@ ar@@ t of our policy areas .
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing the report to this stage .
quality , as we have been he@@ ar@@ ing , can be a pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t in education , especially when one l@@ o@@ o@@ ks at any form of as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
there are certain areas , such as l@@ it@@ er@@ ac@@ y and n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ac@@ y , where we can now g@@ a@@ in some idea of what has been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
there are many international st@@ u@@ di@@ es which have th@@ ro@@ w@@ n up di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es , however , when it comes to making st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t com@@ par@@ is@@ ons , because of di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in c@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ u@@ l@@ u@@ m , approach and the under@@ l@@ ying as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tions about what con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a good education .
it is essential not to con@@ f@@ u@@ se education with training .
the pr@@ im@@ ary pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of education is not to pre@@ par@@ e people for the j@@ o@@ b market but to pre@@ par@@ e them for a life which is f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ing in every way .
in an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble or p@@ rec@@ ar@@ i@@ ous working environment people will be th@@ ro@@ w@@ n back on their in@@ n@@ er resources at many ti@@ m@@ es in their li@@ v@@ es and social cohesion is par@@ tly de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on such per@@ s@@ on@@ al re@@ si@@ li@@ ence .
we only have to look at what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s to those who are th@@ ro@@ w@@ n out of work or who are ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded from the j@@ o@@ b market .
so when we are as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the quality of education , we want to see if we can de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p people who have s@@ el@@ f @-@ e@@ st@@ e@@ e@@ m and con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence , who can com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ate e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , who can look be@@ h@@ in@@ d the information for the h@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ en m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge , who can question , who can work as part of a te@@ am and in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ently , and who are c@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ ve , res@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ ful and have an ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ation of the w@@ i@@ d@@ er world and their responsibility to it .
I also think that when we are l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the quality of education we need to see if it is d@@ el@@ i@@ ver@@ ing real e@@ quality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing , as society does , so much to ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de people on g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of a p@@ o@@ or b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d or their c@@ ol@@ our or w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er .
so in our com@@ par@@ is@@ ons and b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king we have to look be@@ y@@ on@@ d n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w le@@ ag@@ u@@ e ta@@ ble ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es .
after all , every f@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ b@@ all te@@ am in a le@@ ag@@ u@@ e de@@ pen@@ ds upon the level of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment and the s@@ el@@ ec@@ tion of the very best .
it does not n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y improve the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of all .
I am g@@ la@@ d to see that we are rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ ing the importance of in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing pu@@ p@@ il@@ s themselves in the development and as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of our ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al system .
we cannot ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p fully r@@ ou@@ n@@ ded and responsible in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als if they are not en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged to be con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive and ar@@ ti@@ c@@ u@@ late about this major com@@ p@@ on@@ ent of their li@@ v@@ es .
after all , education pro@@ per@@ ly done is a c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ a@@ ti@@ ve ad@@ v@@ en@@ ture and we know we have a l@@ o@@ t to le@@ ar@@ n from each other .
that is why I welcome this report .
Mr President , evaluation in general and evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education in particular are not a m@@ er@@ e for@@ m@@ al@@ ity .
their pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e is always to ch@@ ec@@ k if the per@@ s@@ on being e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ated has m@@ e@@ t the pre@@ defin@@ ed ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s of the per@@ s@@ on con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ting the evaluation , who se@@ ts both the evaluation c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a and the consequences of their being m@@ e@@ t or not .
c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation on the part of the Member States in e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ating sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing an important to@@ o@@ l for in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ing in the Member States &apos; education systems , the a@@ i@@ m being to promote an education mo@@ de@@ l which is a far c@@ r@@ y from a uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l , qu@@ an@@ t@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y and qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y b@@ road general education .
a mo@@ de@@ l which is even a far c@@ r@@ y from the principle of en@@ sur@@ ing that everyone is given the same start in life .
a mo@@ de@@ l which costs little but which s@@ er@@ v@@ es the needs of b@@ i@@ g b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s for a c@@ he@@ a@@ p and , more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , d@@ o@@ c@@ il@@ e la@@ b@@ our force , a la@@ b@@ our force which is w@@ h@@ ol@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to its re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
this policy results in c@@ u@@ t@@ b@@ ac@@ ks in general education for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of training which pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ able la@@ b@@ our ; it even results in general education being re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by an en@@ d@@ less process of life @-@ long le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing .
it also results in the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er - and g@@ en@@ er@@ ally p@@ o@@ or - st@@ u@@ d@@ ents being sh@@ i@@ f@@ ted out of ma@@ in@@ st@@ re@@ am education into second @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s training , as is the case in G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , where the number of si@@ x@@ th form st@@ u@@ d@@ ents has f@@ al@@ l@@ en by 3@@ 5 % in a few years following the so @-@ called education reform .
evaluation also as@@ p@@ i@@ res to b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing a le@@ v@@ er which can be used to force sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s to op@@ er@@ ate in a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve environment in which the best sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s att@@ ra@@ c@@ t the best pu@@ p@@ il@@ s , the best te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers and the most funding - in other words to op@@ er@@ ate on market c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
this will result in f@@ al@@ l@@ ing st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds in the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , especially in working @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s d@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ts and the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
in addition , the system of s@@ el@@ f @-@ evaluation sh@@ i@@ f@@ ts the government &apos;s responsibility for the quality of education on to te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers , pu@@ p@@ il@@ s and par@@ ents .
if we were t@@ r@@ u@@ ly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the quality of education , we would not be con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ting on evaluation m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s but on im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of education for everyone .
the debate on how to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out evaluation is f@@ u@@ ti@@ le and mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ing .
what does make s@@ en@@ se is to debate the e@@ s@@ s@@ ence of the problem . what t@@ y@@ p@@ e of per@@ s@@ on do sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s m@@ ou@@ l@@ d and for what s@@ or@@ t of society ?
if we were to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate today &apos;s sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s on the basis of this c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion , we would su@@ re@@ ly con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de that they have a long way to go to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the needs of the workers and for social progress .
Mr President , I welcome this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to promote cooperation and quality evaluation in sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education .
I particularly welcome the em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on social in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion .
education is an important , indeed c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , part of society .
our education has an impact on all our li@@ v@@ es and our com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities as well .
recent reports , as those of us from the U@@ K are aware , have t@@ en@@ ded to c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise the te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing of children at a very young age as this could pro@@ ve d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ ing .
it would therefore be good to com@@ par@@ e and con@@ tra@@ st with other European m@@ od@@ el@@ s , within l@@ im@@ its of course , as my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e Mrs L@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ er@@ t has already st@@ res@@ sed .
S@@ pa@@ in , for example , at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es great importance to social in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing per@@ s@@ on@@ al@@ ities , working in te@@ a@@ m@@ s ; in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting .
these are pla@@ c@@ ed h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er on the agenda than ac@@ ad@@ em@@ i@@ a and at an e@@ ar@@ ly age .
I also fully agree with better in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion between par@@ ents , pu@@ p@@ il@@ s and te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers and the many com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity pla@@ y@@ ers who ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly want to pla@@ y a role in education and its development and achieve , as a result , the idea of the sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l as the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
it will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in the different regions to share in good p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es .
par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s between different countries are so important , as indeed are par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s not only between countries but between rural and ur@@ b@@ an l@@ in@@ ks .
this is part of a very important t@@ w@@ in@@ n@@ ing con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t and p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y that is well e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in Europe and is pro@@ v@@ ing such a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s throughout all our com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
n@@ et@@ working is so important .
I st@@ res@@ s that the sh@@ ar@@ ing of good p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es and the sh@@ ar@@ ing of information between the different sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in Europe should not de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p into a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve practice .
we should at all costs dis@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge any at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to c@@ re@@ ate European le@@ ag@@ u@@ e ta@@ ble of sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r to that in the U@@ K that has pro@@ v@@ ed so d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ en@@ ta@@ l .
I welcome the report , it is a positive pa@@ per and one that we can b@@ u@@ il@@ d on to c@@ re@@ ate better ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks within the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are only at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the new year and I believe that it is still appropriate to say to you and your f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies that I hope this year will see all your d@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ s come t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
to everyone here at the European Parliament and the Commission , I hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the past .
today &apos; s b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s is to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on quality evaluation of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education .
this d@@ ra@@ f@@ t has already made good progress and had the full b@@ ac@@ king of the European Parliament .
I would like to thank Parliament for its en@@ or@@ m@@ ous support which was te@@ st@@ im@@ on@@ y to its political will to for@@ ge a@@ he@@ a@@ d , something that was , at ti@@ m@@ es , difficult .
Parliament made many positive su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons which , over the years , have been put into practice in the field .
I would particularly like to give s@@ in@@ c@@ er@@ e th@@ an@@ ks to the rapporteur , Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te , for the excellent work that she has carried out in extremely sh@@ or@@ t time f@@ ra@@ m@@ es and I would also like to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d my th@@ an@@ ks to everyone in the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t .
you have before you a d@@ ra@@ f@@ t re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation which , as some of you have mentioned , re@@ la@@ tes to a key issue at the he@@ ar@@ t of our political priorities , to w@@ it , can we guarantee im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in the quality of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education and , if so , how do we go about it so that the European Union can give this a b@@ it of a n@@ u@@ d@@ ge in the right di@@ rec@@ tion , without in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ing in European systems which are , and re@@ main , the responsibility of the national M@@ in@@ is@@ ters for E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation ?
you are aware that we have already made con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able progress towards this g@@ o@@ al , since the la@@ un@@ ch of the major p@@ il@@ o@@ t pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate the quality of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education to@@ o@@ k place at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic year . over 1@@ 00 se@@ con@@ d@@ ary sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in 1@@ 8 countries to@@ o@@ k part in this pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation is , to a great ex@@ t@@ ent , based on the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons which we c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y d@@ re@@ w from this re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch .
the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation re@@ la@@ tes to two c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al points .
first of all , that of evaluation as an in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment to improve quality - the a@@ i@@ m of which is not to establish who is to@@ p and who is bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m of the c@@ la@@ s@@ s , but rather simply to ac@@ t as an in@@ c@@ en@@ tive so that everyone en@@ ds up at the to@@ p of the c@@ la@@ s@@ s .
secondly , the role of European cooperation in this area .
this is , mo@@ re@@ over , something we know how to do very well , and we have d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted as much .
in this s@@ en@@ se , the proposal en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ es s@@ el@@ f @-@ evaluation , external evaluation and ur@@ g@@ es all st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers to pla@@ y a part in every as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the evaluation process so that , in the end , sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s are in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ red to le@@ ar@@ n from each other and can i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy good p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es and the most e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent to@@ ol@@ s for evaluation .
in this process , the Commission shall not p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ be any rules and is f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ing its role as a c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st .
it is en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing European cooperation between sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and en@@ ab@@ ling them to establish a Europe @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e n@@ et@@ work .
it is t@@ r@@ ying to set up a d@@ a@@ ta@@ b@@ a@@ se of to@@ ol@@ s and in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments to be used by sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in s@@ el@@ f @-@ evaluation and which will then by available to all st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers involved .
that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y what the L@@ is@@ b@@ on European Council as@@ k@@ ed us to do .
if we wish to place European society at the f@@ o@@ re@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t of the world stage as an example of the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge society , then clearly , the extremely high quality of te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing in sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in every Member State , area and v@@ il@@ la@@ ge should be the ra@@ is@@ on d &apos; ê@@ t@@ r@@ e for social e@@ quality a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st citizens .
Mr K@@ ar@@ as said that , in today &apos; s sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , we are c@@ re@@ ating the society and the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w &apos; s society and I agree with this w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly .
from this per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive , it is our responsibility to provide every available to@@ o@@ l and to ensure that sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s le@@ ar@@ n from each other , that the system im@@ pro@@ v@@ es e@@ ver@@ y@@ where and that no one is le@@ f@@ t by the w@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
that is actually the g@@ o@@ al of a k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge society .
we cannot a@@ f@@ for@@ d ourselves the l@@ u@@ x@@ ur@@ y of 20 % , at the very least , of pu@@ p@@ il@@ s being le@@ f@@ t by the w@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e because they have not received the education they need to be able to do well in society .
I agree with those of you who , on this point , said that you need to pre@@ par@@ e for life in society before pre@@ par@@ ing for life on the employment market .
mo@@ re@@ over , that is a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able l@@ o@@ s@@ s for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress .
ladies and gentlemen , together with the M@@ in@@ is@@ ters for E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , we are making these proposals on quality an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s to en@@ able us to give this opportunity to all young people , because if they rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve a high quality education then it is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y that they will be able to do well in society and be able to find a j@@ o@@ b .
that is why I would once again like to thank Mrs S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te , the rapporteur , as well as the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t and all the Members who have as@@ s@@ is@@ ted us in this work .
I would like to in@@ for@@ m you that , following the E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation Council &apos; s mo@@ ve to make evaluation and quality a priority issue , action 6 of the S@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ tes programme has put out to t@@ en@@ d@@ er within this very specific area .

world cultural and natural heritage
the next it@@ e@@ m is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 2 / 2000 ) by Mrs D@@ e V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c , on behalf of the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t , on the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation in the EU countries of the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion for the P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l and N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l H@@ er@@ it@@ age &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 2000 / 2@@ 0@@ 3@@ 6 ( I@@ N@@ I ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ;
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a com@@ m@@ on@@ place to say that our heritage and its protection are c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al com@@ p@@ on@@ ents of European i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity , a com@@ m@@ on@@ place but t@@ r@@ u@@ e , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s .
our heritage is one of the most v@@ is@@ i@@ ble com@@ p@@ on@@ ents , one of those c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st to the c@@ ul@@ ture of our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w citizens .
it for@@ m@@ s part of their e@@ ver@@ y@@ d@@ a@@ y environment and their own i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity .
it st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ s the s@@ en@@ se of b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to the European Union by i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying the ro@@ o@@ t@@ s we all share .
protection of heritage is therefore a v@@ it@@ al n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ity in view of the ra@@ va@@ g@@ es it su@@ f@@ f@@ ers over time , but also in view of the new for@@ m@@ s of at@@ ta@@ c@@ k it is under@@ going , such as at@@ m@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ h@@ er@@ ic p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , un@@ co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated ur@@ b@@ an@@ is@@ ation , d@@ em@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c p@@ res@@ sure and , unfortunately , many others .
the European Parliament has ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ ed this matter very s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly with , in particular , two res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions adopted in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 and 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 , which provide a f@@ ra@@ me of re@@ f@@ er@@ ence for the action to be un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en in this field .
I now consider it necessary to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the current situation on this issue , taking into account both the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity and the development of the European Union due to the in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d number of Member States .
it is wor@@ th rec@@ al@@ l@@ ing the objective of the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which is to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t heritage and not to en@@ ter it on a heritage l@@ is@@ t .
since the last time s@@ it@@ es were s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted in December 2000 , 6@@ 9@@ 0 s@@ it@@ es have been ad@@ ded to the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ er@@ it@@ age L@@ is@@ t , 2@@ 0@@ 8 of which are l@@ o@@ c@@ ated within the European Union .
of these 2@@ 0@@ 8 s@@ it@@ es , 1@@ 9@@ 2 are cultural pro@@ per@@ ti@@ es , 1@@ 1 are natural s@@ it@@ es and 5 are pro@@ per@@ ti@@ es of m@@ i@@ x@@ ed t@@ y@@ p@@ e .
the fact that the European Union is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly pla@@ c@@ ed on this l@@ is@@ t , with al@@ most a third of the s@@ it@@ es , is e@@ a@@ si@@ ly ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed in terms of Europe &apos; s contribution to world c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ is@@ ation .
however , in order to ob@@ ta@@ in a better b@@ al@@ ance on the l@@ is@@ t between the various c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies and also between States , U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O has d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up a world strategy and an action plan for the implementation of that strategy .
I think it appropriate that Parliament re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d that Member States that can pr@@ i@@ d@@ e themselves on a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant number of l@@ is@@ ted s@@ it@@ es should re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ t the number of s@@ it@@ es they pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e in future .
I think it per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly re@@ as@@ on@@ able that they should make a contribution towards making the world l@@ is@@ t more re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive and more b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed , both g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ ally and in terms of its con@@ t@@ ent .
when this report was adopted by Parliament &apos; s Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t , the two pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on s@@ el@@ f @-@ im@@ p@@ o@@ sed re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion were w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n by a very s@@ li@@ m ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity .
I do however feel , ladies and gentlemen , that these pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons should be re@@ in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated , and I have therefore tabled two amendments to this effect on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group .
another proposal was made in the report for a European l@@ is@@ t to be d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up , for U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O se@@ es heritage s@@ it@@ es pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y from a g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical point of view , which re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ts their con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of what a s@@ it@@ e is .
a por@@ t may be c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fied , for example , without any regard for the bo@@ at@@ s . a st@@ e@@ e@@ l pl@@ ant may be c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fied without regard for the e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
I feel that Europe , the European Union , on the other hand should look at things from a d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c point of view .
it could therefore take action on d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c aspects of heritage and , from this point of view , a European l@@ is@@ t may re@@ p@@ res@@ ent real progress .
it would make it possible to ra@@ ise the prof@@ il@@ e of s@@ it@@ es which are of more than pu@@ re@@ ly national importance but which are not yet acc@@ or@@ d@@ ed world rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition .
that would mo@@ re@@ over help to bring Europe c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the people , g@@ i@@ v@@ ing them an a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of a s@@ ha@@ red cultural heritage .
there is often need for heritage to be re@@ st@@ o@@ re@@ d .
the Commission should draw up a report on the position of re@@ st@@ o@@ re@@ r@@ s in Member States with a view to st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing the re@@ st@@ or@@ ation sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work .
high @-@ quality re@@ st@@ or@@ ation re@@ qu@@ i@@ res su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent funding , and the need for ec@@ on@@ om@@ y should not over@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ e the need for quality work .
finally , I su@@ g@@ g@@ est that the European Commission should , in li@@ a@@ is@@ on with the Council of Europe and U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O , look into the v@@ i@@ ability of a legal and f@@ is@@ c@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment in order to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate for@@ m@@ s of p@@ at@@ r@@ on@@ age re@@ la@@ ting to the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of the cultural and natural heritage .
this as@@ p@@ ec@@ t might be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ations on the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of European tax systems .
protection of heritage is an area over which we must be con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally v@@ i@@ g@@ il@@ ant .
it is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations .
the young people of Europe must be able to i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy themselves in this in order to b@@ u@@ il@@ d their future and to be able to per@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ ve their European i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity more clearly .
su@@ re@@ ly the fe@@ el@@ ing of being European re@@ la@@ tes far more to cultural re@@ f@@ er@@ ences than to economic and social d@@ at@@ a ?
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , let me re@@ p@@ e@@ at this ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion which you will all rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise as em@@ an@@ ating from one of the great f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ers of the European Union , &quot; I@@ f I had to start again , I would start with c@@ ul@@ ture . &quot;
it is something which could have been said by H@@ a@@ y@@ d@@ n com@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing in L@@ on@@ d@@ on , d@@ a V@@ in@@ c@@ i pa@@ in@@ t@@ ing in A@@ m@@ bo@@ ise , or B@@ y@@ r@@ on d@@ ying in M@@ is@@ s@@ ol@@ on@@ g@@ h@@ i .
it is the fe@@ el@@ ing , the p@@ le@@ a@@ sure we all ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence when tra@@ v@@ el@@ ling through the European Union and mar@@ v@@ el@@ ling at the t@@ re@@ a@@ su@@ res we find there and the pr@@ i@@ d@@ e we feel that , th@@ an@@ ks to the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence of the European Union , we are in some small way o@@ w@@ n@@ ers , and also their c@@ u@@ st@@ o@@ di@@ ans for all time .
Mr President , Commissioner , world cultural heritage - we have just he@@ ar@@ d the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s - is d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y u@@ n@@ e@@ v@@ en@@ ly .
most of it is here in Europe , which is something we can be very pr@@ ou@@ d of , although it also s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that there are certain in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities .
also , there are very few s@@ it@@ es , i@@ .@@ e@@ . pla@@ c@@ es that have been de@@ em@@ ed part of world cultural heritage , in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with the number f@@ ou@@ n@@ d in the re@@ st of the world , and it is a real d@@ ro@@ p in the o@@ c@@ e@@ an , because there are many more s@@ it@@ es that would m@@ er@@ it this kind of st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s and support .
this si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ies n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the decision @-@ making process n@@ or the s@@ el@@ ec@@ tion procedures .
more ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations are re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted than are acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted , and I think there is a need to re@@ defin@@ e the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
the di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of cultural heritage under@@ l@@ in@@ es the i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity of a country &apos; s own regions , which is why responsibility must pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y be taken and as@@ s@@ er@@ ted at regional level , w@@ h@@ il@@ st ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing that they must be a@@ f@@ for@@ ded su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al support from ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e , from the European Union and from all those who are j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly responsible .
these regional res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of h@@ om@@ el@@ an@@ ds , c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s and tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons , the development of a country &apos; s own regions and so on and so for@@ th .
as I see it , these are c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a that can pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y only be man@@ ag@@ ed at regional level .
the importance of world cultural heritage s@@ it@@ es trans@@ c@@ en@@ ds the sc@@ op@@ e of regional development .
they are cultural t@@ re@@ a@@ su@@ res , and be@@ a@@ r w@@ it@@ ness to e@@ p@@ o@@ ch @-@ making ch@@ an@@ g@@ es and uni@@ qu@@ e o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ences in nature .
they have ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l v@@ al@@ u@@ e .
ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l cultural heritage , land de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed and c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted by m@@ an and ur@@ b@@ an cultural heritage b@@ el@@ on@@ g together , but the p@@ ic@@ ture is not com@@ p@@ le@@ te un@@ less it also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es m@@ on@@ u@@ ments to con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y , from the world of work for example , such as de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in working life , the b@@ u@@ il@@ ding of f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies , ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es and so on and so for@@ th .
they tra@@ ce the development of the working process of our d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , and also el@@ se@@ where in the world .
it is therefore just as important to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the p@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ er@@ ing of ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l fin@@ ds as it is to com@@ b@@ at the th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ less d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts of social institutions .
ra@@ p@@ i@@ d te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical development and ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in our environment really bring h@@ om@@ e how important it is to s@@ par@@ e a th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t for our natural heritage and take responsibility , in other words development pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing and ch@@ an@@ g@@ es of de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ ted land u@@ sa@@ g@@ es must fe@@ a@@ ture more pr@@ om@@ in@@ ently in our responsibility for the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of our cultural heritage .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , when s@@ el@@ ec@@ ting world cultural heritage s@@ it@@ es , there must be more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ ing a b@@ al@@ ance between h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic s@@ it@@ es , re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous m@@ on@@ u@@ ments , the various re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ons from pre@@ h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic ti@@ m@@ es , con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y and natural heritage , and the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a must be a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed with this in mind .
the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of our cultural heritage is as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated not only with a high level of responsibility , but also with high levels of c@@ o@@ s@@ t .
we therefore need to find w@@ a@@ y@@ s of al@@ le@@ v@@ i@@ ating the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing as@@ p@@ ec@@ t , of con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing the legal and f@@ is@@ c@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment and pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing s@@ p@@ on@@ s@@ or@@ s with in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es to make us more con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ous of this responsibility .
Mr President , in the European Union and in this Parliament , we must deal with what is essential for European cooperation , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that which c@@ re@@ a@@ tes a st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er and s@@ l@@ im@@ m@@ er Europe , and we must be very c@@ a@@ re@@ ful not to take on any ta@@ s@@ ks which more pro@@ per@@ ly f@@ all to the Member States .
it is important to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t cultural heritage , and the Union &apos; s common cultural heritage is its di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
it is a great and v@@ it@@ al responsibility to sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d this di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity in every s@@ in@@ g@@ le Member State .
I therefore consider this report to be su@@ per@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ous .
on the basis of the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , it is my view that pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting cultural heritage is a ta@@ s@@ k for the Member States .
up until now , the Member States have h@@ el@@ p@@ ed implement the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion C@@ on@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ ing the P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l and N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l H@@ er@@ it@@ age by ta@@ b@@ ling proposals - many of them - for in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion on U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O &apos; s l@@ is@@ t of v@@ al@@ u@@ es of s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance .
there is pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly a dis@@ pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ a@@ te@@ ly high number of European to@@ p@@ ic@@ s on the l@@ is@@ t and , as the rapporteur re@@ mar@@ ks , a little more m@@ od@@ e@@ st@@ y might well be in order .
I do not think it g@@ o@@ es without sa@@ ying that there should be a special l@@ is@@ t de@@ ta@@ il@@ ing European cultural heritage . n@@ or do I think it necessary for the Commission to take on the major ta@@ s@@ k of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating the initiatives , as many have re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed .
on behalf of the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party , I have therefore tabled a s@@ er@@ ies of amendments w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by Parliament is to call upon the Member States , and not the Commission , to implement the necessary cooperation in con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion with U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O and the Council of Europe .
I have done this in order to h@@ on@@ our the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity and also with re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to R@@ om@@ an@@ o P@@ ro@@ d@@ i &apos; s words here in Parliament last year when he said , &quot; L@@ e@@ t us re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er how often we have been made into a la@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ing st@@ o@@ c@@ k because we deal with things that are ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly r@@ i@@ d@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous , which de@@ fy common s@@ en@@ se and conflict with the interests of our population &quot; .
I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union &apos; s work on h@@ ol@@ d for a sh@@ or@@ t while .
Mr President , the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es our con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions on its initiative to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t this report on how we can pro@@ te@@ c@@ t our cultural and natural heritage in the European Union , as does the rapporteur for the i@@ d@@ e@@ as and measures which she re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ds , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of which I agree with .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally - to come back to what the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er said - every Member State of the European Union has a policy on these issues .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , we have no in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of su@@ per@@ se@@ ding national policy .
however , we really do need a more general per@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion and a policy at Union level .
and the reason is clear : it is because all Union policies have a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able impact on how we p@@ res@@ er@@ ve and promote our cultural and natural heritage - ma@@ in@@ ly a n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve impact .
for example , the Union f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently funds projects and in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions through the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds which d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y or s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t m@@ on@@ u@@ ments , the l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and other el@@ em@@ ents of our cultural and natural heritage .
there are , unfortunately , n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es from G@@ re@@ ec@@ e al@@ one .
we f@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t long and h@@ ar@@ d some time ago to st@@ o@@ p the E@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ a m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way from being r@@ ou@@ ted al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e the an@@ c@@ i@@ ent D@@ od@@ on@@ i th@@ e@@ at@@ r@@ e , where it would have pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted the a@@ u@@ di@@ ence from he@@ ar@@ ing the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
because of p@@ res@@ sure from n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous organisations , the question of el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity p@@ y@@ l@@ ons on the C@@ y@@ c@@ la@@ d@@ es is@@ l@@ an@@ ds was taken to the P@@ ri@@ v@@ y Council , the S@@ u@@ pre@@ me A@@ d@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive Court in G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , which b@@ ro@@ k@@ e new g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d in its j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment and rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised , yet again , the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of the be@@ a@@ u@@ ty of the l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e on these is@@ l@@ an@@ ds .
today , the question is still in ab@@ e@@ y@@ ance of the new O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ i@@ c f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities in S@@ ch@@ in@@ i@@ a in M@@ ar@@ a@@ th@@ on , an h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic s@@ it@@ e pa@@ r ex@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ence for the whole of Europe as well as a particularly important w@@ et@@ land which was in@@ it@@ i@@ ally in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the Í@@ Á@@ Ô@@ U@@ R@@ A 2000 l@@ is@@ t@@ s , Commissioner .
we should like to sa@@ ve it , quite how I do not know .
the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion is also in ab@@ e@@ y@@ ance of the new m@@ u@@ se@@ u@@ m on the A@@ c@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ is , a st@@ one &apos;s th@@ ro@@ w from the sa@@ c@@ red ro@@ c@@ k and the P@@ ar@@ th@@ en@@ on . it is to be l@@ o@@ c@@ ated on to@@ p of ol@@ d@@ er ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical re@@ ma@@ in@@ s , th@@ e@@ re@@ by en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ing both the re@@ ma@@ in@@ s in question and the a@@ e@@ s@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c@@ s of the whole area and the v@@ is@@ t@@ a le@@ ad@@ ing up to the world @-@ r@@ en@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ed sa@@ c@@ red ro@@ c@@ k and the P@@ ar@@ th@@ en@@ on .
this pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t and many others have one th@@ ing in common : they hope to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve , or they are already in rec@@ e@@ i@@ p@@ t of , Community funding .
it is therefore quite clear why I w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly support the particular points in the resolution which call on the Commission to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine projects from the point of view of their impact on cultural and natural heritage , their h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical importance and their v@@ is@@ u@@ al impact , all of which should be made into el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ bility c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , before any funding is ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed .
Mr President , Mrs de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c &apos; s report se@@ e@@ ks to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of heritage and the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a for the s@@ el@@ ec@@ tion of national heritage s@@ it@@ es in particular .
the U@@ E@@ N Group will vote in favour of this report .
no one can question the need to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d this con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t to s@@ it@@ es which are not just m@@ on@@ u@@ ments , natural s@@ it@@ es or mo@@ v@@ e@@ able pro@@ per@@ ty .
there is clearly a great deal of e@@ th@@ no@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c d@@ at@@ a which can be c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ted and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted as world heritage .
the importance of m@@ u@@ si@@ c@@ al heritage or l@@ it@@ er@@ a@@ ture in the or@@ al tra@@ d@@ ition may be em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed , the ta@@ s@@ k of c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tion , an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s and protection of which still re@@ ma@@ in@@ s to be carried out in a good many countries .
this heritage , which g@@ o@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t which often em@@ b@@ ra@@ c@@ es only m@@ on@@ u@@ ments or s@@ it@@ es , is often a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r in the d@@ a@@ il@@ y li@@ v@@ es of the people li@@ v@@ ing on this e@@ ar@@ th .
it is this p@@ res@@ ence and per@@ man@@ ence in c@@ ul@@ ture and d@@ a@@ il@@ y life which should defin@@ e the very con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of heritage , as indeed Mrs P@@ re@@ ts mentioned .
I should therefore like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e , for example , particularly here in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , the importance which our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w citizens at@@ ta@@ ch to their national c@@ ur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es and their de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to consider it as a part of their heritage .
the G@@ er@@ m@@ an ma@@ g@@ a@@ z@@ ine , F@@ o@@ c@@ us @-@ M@@ on@@ e@@ y , rec@@ ently pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed a sur@@ v@@ e@@ y s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing that 7@@ 0 % of G@@ er@@ man@@ s are com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the D@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ s@@ ch@@ mar@@ k and wish to re@@ ta@@ in it .
this per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge is an a@@ ver@@ age , because in e@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n G@@ er@@ many the ra@@ te is as much as 8@@ 0 % .
the French F@@ in@@ ance Minister , responsible for im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ al of the f@@ r@@ an@@ c , rec@@ ently pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on his w@@ e@@ b@@ s@@ it@@ e a very in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing sur@@ v@@ e@@ y on the French people &apos; s commitment to their c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency .
this is , ad@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ d@@ ly , a &apos; re@@ ver@@ se di@@ ag@@ no@@ si@@ s &apos; because they were , of course , as@@ k@@ ed their opinion on the e@@ ur@@ o and not on the f@@ r@@ an@@ c .
n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the res@@ p@@ on@@ se was over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing .
only 2@@ 6 % of the French have con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in this ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency .
I think it wor@@ th in@@ for@@ m@@ ing you of the real state of a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s , given that this is something that does not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to have been taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation or to have any in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence over the European Parliament .
in G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , which has for the moment dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t its national heritage in the form of the p@@ ou@@ n@@ d st@@ er@@ ling , only 1@@ 4 % of young people in the 1@@ 8 @-@ 2@@ 4 age r@@ an@@ ge wish to give up the p@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
by this st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d , the 4@@ 5 % of D@@ an@@ es who g@@ a@@ ve a y@@ es an@@ s@@ w@@ er would make the recent re@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ d@@ u@@ m in D@@ en@@ mar@@ k look like a vote in favour of the s@@ in@@ g@@ le c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency .
E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans are com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to their own c@@ ur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es just as they are com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to their own v@@ al@@ u@@ es , their own n@@ ations , their own natural heritage s@@ it@@ es , their own l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es and their own c@@ a@@ th@@ ed@@ r@@ als .
this is how national c@@ ur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es should be pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted , as if they were part of world heritage .
this is the th@@ r@@ u@@ st of the amendment I have tabled on behalf of my group and which I ur@@ ge you to support .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c , who has set out and el@@ ab@@ or@@ ated on the subject of a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage in the Member States of the European Union , con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing in her report the un@@ d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ed interest which Europe needs to have in this important issue , together with the initiatives which need to be taken throughout the world .
although Nice did not take the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al decision of ex@@ em@@ p@@ ting c@@ ul@@ ture from the un@@ an@@ im@@ ity r@@ ul@@ ing , th@@ e@@ re@@ by en@@ ab@@ ling us to take a more dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve st@@ e@@ p towards con@@ ver@@ g@@ ence , what is important , as the report con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ s , is that the European Union is working to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p a di@@ ver@@ se cultural area .
e@@ qu@@ ally important , in my view , is Europe &apos;s a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , as the report st@@ a@@ tes , that it is over @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted on the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ er@@ it@@ age l@@ is@@ t and that this over @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion ap@@ p@@ li@@ es both to h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic to@@ w@@ n@@ s and to re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s , as com@@ pa@@ red with other c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies of countries , to C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an@@ ity in relation to other re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ons and b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ s and to &apos; el@@ it@@ is@@ t &apos; as op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to ver@@ n@@ ac@@ u@@ la@@ r ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture .
this a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes that the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and respect for what is f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n is an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted idea right at the n@@ u@@ b of the problem and will help Europe pla@@ y a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l role in relation to the re@@ st of the world in the er@@ a of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
as far as the proposals are concerned , I think that the proposal to take the initiative on h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation at min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al level is especially important , as is dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve action by the Member States to st@@ o@@ p the p@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ er@@ ing of and the il@@ legal trade in ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical fin@@ ds within the countries of the European Union .
mo@@ re@@ over - and here I agree with Mr P@@ a@@ pa@@ y@@ an@@ n@@ a@@ k@@ is - I think that cultural impact st@@ u@@ di@@ es should be a com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion when dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing which projects to f@@ un@@ d with European money , so that we a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d c@@ a@@ using what is often in@@ c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ble d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge .
it is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed that the C@@ ul@@ ture 2000 programme has al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated one third of its b@@ u@@ d@@ get to cultural , ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical , under@@ w@@ a@@ ter and ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l heritage and to m@@ u@@ se@@ u@@ m@@ s , li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ ies and ar@@ ch@@ i@@ v@@ es , th@@ e@@ re@@ by st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing national action .
however , as the report points out , attention must be pa@@ i@@ d to rural heritage , to an@@ c@@ i@@ ent and P@@ al@@ a@@ e@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s , to ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s and w@@ et@@ l@@ an@@ ds , in other words to what are con@@ si@@ de@@ red more or less mar@@ g@@ in@@ al issues .
education and training in all prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons involved in pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting , p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ing and pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing cultural and natural heritage are also important , as are ra@@ is@@ ing pu@@ p@@ il@@ s &apos; and young people &apos;s a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing a movement of v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities which can also make a dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve contribution .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d and very in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive report . I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of work she has put into it .
it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s , at least , that the European Union and the Member States have done their h@@ om@@ e@@ work , and have done it well .
they have su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted many ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations , so much so that this has led to an im@@ b@@ al@@ ance .
in my opinion , this is due to the opinion that it is especially b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s that must be re@@ g@@ is@@ te@@ red . there are , of course , also other aspects , and I believe we should encourage Member States to take measures so that we can re@@ d@@ res@@ s the b@@ al@@ ance and be more s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive .
my own group is de@@ b@@ ating whether or not the European Union has a ta@@ s@@ k here .
first of all , the p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of our cultural heritage , also at European level , ap@@ p@@ e@@ als to the c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en .
our h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic m@@ on@@ u@@ ment d@@ a@@ y@@ s are always very well att@@ en@@ ded .
our cultural heritage is an excellent to@@ o@@ l to make the European d@@ im@@ en@@ sion v@@ is@@ i@@ ble .
secondly , European ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e is e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent in many areas , for example in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order projects in the W@@ ad@@ d@@ en S@@ e@@ a region and under@@ w@@ a@@ ter ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
the European Union can encourage Member States to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate , and can o@@ f@@ f@@ er support in all cultural areas , for example .
another point where the European Union can f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l a t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally European ta@@ s@@ k is re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and education .
so is c@@ re@@ ating c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity as to which areas trans@@ c@@ end national interests .
d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting in@@ v@@ ent@@ or@@ ies and l@@ is@@ t@@ s is necessary at every ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive level , and it is important to w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h up all the pro@@ s and con@@ s when taking environmental action .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , I would m@@ en@@ tion the de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment of st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l funds .
p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ing cultural heritage is important for t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m .
it b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity into f@@ o@@ c@@ us . it has a be@@ ar@@ ing on employment .
the question of whether the European Union has a ta@@ s@@ k is not a question to me .
in this area , the European Union has a ta@@ s@@ k to st@@ im@@ u@@ late , support and make v@@ is@@ i@@ ble Europe &apos; s common cultural heritage .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , I , al@@ on@@ g with others in my group , will give my un@@ qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied support to the rapporteur &apos; s report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it so ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s that I was involved in the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion in a particular case . at a U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O meeting some years ago in C@@ a@@ sa@@ b@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ a , the issue was raised of whether to make the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e A@@ l@@ p@@ ine R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on a W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ er@@ it@@ age S@@ ite .
I con@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ s to fe@@ el@@ ing s@@ om@@ e@@ what per@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ed at this point , for I f@@ ou@@ n@@ d the idea of l@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e A@@ l@@ p@@ ine R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on , which co@@ ver@@ s a whole r@@ an@@ ge of different areas , together as one s@@ it@@ e rather od@@ d .
I was a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed by the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es between the s@@ it@@ es s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted - certainly not due to any f@@ a@@ ul@@ t of U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O &apos;s but because of the v@@ ar@@ ying n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of the s@@ it@@ es put forward by the States .
I also no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed the con@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ u@@ ous ab@@ s@@ ence of some cultural , natural or m@@ i@@ x@@ ed s@@ it@@ es . in this regard , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a of our group , who is the ma@@ y@@ or of V@@ en@@ ice , re@@ min@@ ded us ir@@ on@@ ic@@ ally , a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s ago , that V@@ en@@ ice has n@@ e@@ v@@ er been c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fied as a W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ er@@ it@@ age S@@ ite .
well then , upon re@@ ad@@ ing the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion my su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion was con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed : the 3@@ 0 year @-@ ol@@ d C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion is now pre@@ h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic .
in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , we have become much more s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve towards c@@ ul@@ ture and the environment - consider the b@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ wor@@ d &apos; su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development &apos; .
this is why I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that the report will pro@@ ve to be full of in@@ con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es : some issues need to be si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fied because of the need for co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between European countries rather than European in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions , which can be un@@ necessary and are s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es used by the Member States as an ex@@ c@@ use to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
mo@@ re@@ over , in certain cases , the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res already ex@@ is@@ t . I would point out - and this is a positive fact - that the te@@ x@@ t re@@ f@@ ers to regional min@@ or@@ ity l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , which are co@@ v@@ e@@ red by a r@@ an@@ ge of pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive measures .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , there are some good points . I would point out that there must be a policy of ac@@ tive in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions in@@ as@@ much as the protection of s@@ it@@ es wor@@ ks well if the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the commitment of fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing ; the su@@ m@@ s re@@ f@@ er@@ red to by the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which are min@@ i@@ ma@@ l , are certainly not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent for ac@@ tive in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions , especially in T@@ h@@ ir@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d countries .
it would be a good idea for the Commission , s@@ o@@ on@@ er or la@@ ter , to in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate the l@@ im@@ it which State aid may ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed , as la@@ i@@ d down in A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 8@@ 7 ( 3 ) ( d ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am going to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s that area of Europe &apos; s cultural heritage which is not in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded on U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O &apos; s l@@ is@@ t and which is sc@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ y in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded on our own l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
it has to do with the fact that al@@ most every second s@@ qu@@ are m@@ et@@ r@@ e of the European Union is c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted , both the agricultural l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and land given over to f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y .
the whole of Europe &apos; s current b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity is a result of n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly 1@@ 0 000 years of st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le and h@@ ar@@ d@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
it is the f@@ r@@ u@@ it of cooperation between nature , the c@@ li@@ ma@@ te , te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y and the human being as c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ to@@ r .
that is what has given us the in@@ c@@ re@@ di@@ b@@ ly di@@ ver@@ se and many @-@ si@@ d@@ ed Europe with which we are f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r .
I n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally believe that cultural heritage is a responsibility for regions and n@@ ations and not , in the first place , for the European Union .
there is , however , one area in which the Union has com@@ p@@ le@@ te power over cultural heritage , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y agricultural policy .
if I were in a position to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e , I should ex@@ change the EU &apos; s current agricultural policy for a policy which f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red cultural heritage and b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
I should like to use su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve the c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted ter@@ ra@@ c@@ es ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the Mediterranean and to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve the b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally r@@ ic@@ h and f@@ an@@ ta@@ st@@ ic@@ ally be@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ful m@@ e@@ ad@@ o@@ ws in the m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in areas sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding ri@@ ver@@ s and la@@ k@@ es in th@@ ic@@ k@@ ly w@@ o@@ od@@ ed S@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ a .
in sh@@ or@@ t , a good cultural policy for Europe would be a trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed , m@@ od@@ er@@ n and re@@ le@@ v@@ ant agricultural policy .
ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l of the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes of the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ it@@ ting
the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes of the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ it@@ ting have been d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted .
are there any com@@ ments ?
( the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes were ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed )
1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report by Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 7 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l , on the progress report of the Commission on the measures taken in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions of the European Parliament in its 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge resolution &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ O@@ M ( 2000 ) 2@@ 2@@ 4 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 2@@ 2@@ 3 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 1@@ 1@@ 3 ( D@@ E@@ C ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , there have been further de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments regarding the report on the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
that is a new de@@ par@@ ture , but then again it comes as no sur@@ pr@@ ise , for this was a special case after all .
it was the first dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge after the f@@ all of the S@@ an@@ ter Commission and th@@ us the first opportunity for this Parliament to have a say in the European Commission &apos; s reform policy .
since then , Parliament has made its v@@ i@@ e@@ ws he@@ ar@@ d on a re@@ gu@@ la@@ r basis , no@@ ta@@ b@@ ly in the excellent reports by Mr v@@ an H@@ ul@@ t@@ en and Mr P@@ om@@ é@@ s R@@ u@@ i@@ z .
n@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , the re@@ for@@ m@@ s should help re@@ st@@ or@@ e con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in Europe .
the question today is whether those in@@ it@@ i@@ al st@@ e@@ p@@ s , which were pr@@ om@@ ised at the time in order to ob@@ ta@@ in the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , have actually been made .
all in all , it is f@@ a@@ i@@ r to say that the Commission has made every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of this Parliament .
a serious start has been made on re@@ for@@ m@@ s .
it is , of course , too s@@ o@@ on to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e whether all the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red results have been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed ; too many words still need to be trans@@ la@@ ted into action for that to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
although things can still go p@@ e@@ a@@ r @-@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed , even at Commissioner level - and n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally the ab@@ om@@ in@@ able Commission proposal on access to d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments is one of the things that s@@ pr@@ in@@ g@@ s to mind - it is quite clear that this Commission is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to making a b@@ re@@ a@@ k with the past .
I will give you a few ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es .
in its dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge resolution , this Parliament d@@ em@@ an@@ ded an end to an un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ b@@ ly high per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of er@@ ro@@ r in b@@ il@@ l@@ s .
the Commission su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted proposals to st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ line the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion , and pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a plan to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all ab@@ n@@ or@@ ma@@ l ar@@ re@@ ar@@ s by the end of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 . Parliament is is@@ su@@ ed with si@@ x @-@ m@@ on@@ th@@ ly reports on this .
in addition , Parliament as@@ k@@ ed for a reform of the rules on w@@ h@@ is@@ t@@ le @-@ b@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ers and for dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedures ; the Commission en@@ su@@ red that this reform was made .
Parliament as@@ k@@ ed for im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in the field of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ x for external aid ; ti@@ c@@ k .
Parliament re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed a l@@ is@@ t of current f@@ ra@@ u@@ d and cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion in@@ qu@@ i@@ ri@@ es ; again ti@@ c@@ k .
Parliament as@@ k@@ ed the Commission to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy its f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n aid strategy ; ti@@ c@@ k yet again .
Mr President , these are but a few ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es , but they do d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that the European Parliament can y@@ i@@ el@@ d su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al results if it makes a con@@ c@@ er@@ ted e@@ f@@ for@@ t .
one se@@ c@@ tion of the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge which this Parliament has every reason to be pr@@ ou@@ d , is that concerning the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al in G@@ a@@ z@@ a .
in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 , this pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , which is su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised by the European Union , was 9@@ 7 % com@@ p@@ le@@ te .
due to mis@@ management and a lack of follow @-@ up , this h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al still st@@ o@@ o@@ d em@@ p@@ ty up until the end of last year , at the very time - we are f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with the i@@ ma@@ g@@ es from the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st - when there was a d@@ e@@ s@@ per@@ ate sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of m@@ ed@@ ical help in an area which very much needs it .
in A@@ p@@ ri@@ l 1999 , this Parliament f@@ ou@@ n@@ d out about this s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ ous state of a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s .
from that moment , we g@@ a@@ ve the Commission h@@ el@@ l , with no let @-@ up , until we finally had results .
since the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al op@@ en@@ ed three m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago , more than 2 7@@ 00 pa@@ ti@@ ents have already been t@@ re@@ ated and more than 3@@ 7@@ 0 he@@ al@@ th@@ y b@@ ab@@ ies have been b@@ or@@ n there , which is good n@@ e@@ ws in an area where death is an every @-@ day o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ence .
if this Parliament had not made it so clear that enough was enough , I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al would still be em@@ p@@ ty now .
unfortunately , the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al is now having to f@@ ac@@ e other problems , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y it is im@@ possible to make any d@@ el@@ i@@ ver@@ ies to this h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al due to the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e of G@@ a@@ z@@ a , and even a@@ m@@ b@@ ul@@ ance services cannot get through the I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ i b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ d@@ es , but that is another st@@ or@@ y .
I would like to take the opportunity to go into Mr v@@ an D@@ am &apos; s amendment very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly .
I believe that , although it is an extremely kind and con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ate amendment , the con@@ t@@ ent of which must be given due follow @-@ up , I cannot re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l of it as rapporteur , because we have very con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted new el@@ em@@ ents in the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , so I hope that there will be some under@@ st@@ an@@ ding for this .
n@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , there are also areas of concern with regard to the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
for example , a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er level of transparency must be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed within the per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l policy with regard to rec@@ r@@ u@@ it@@ ment of st@@ a@@ f@@ f and the proposed re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ an@@ c@@ y s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
I also ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the Commissioner to sh@@ ed some li@@ g@@ h@@ t on how the Commission will guarantee that each in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Commissioner will ensure that re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations from the Court of Auditors do not end up in some d@@ ra@@ w@@ er s@@ om@@ e@@ where , but will be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted with due c@@ are .
this Parliament will m@@ on@@ it@@ or the follow @-@ up of all reports b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t by the Commission .
the ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve p@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ es for the com@@ ing years must be trans@@ la@@ ted into action , and I hope that we can do this together , and in doing so , c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e o@@ f@@ f this sa@@ d c@@ ha@@ p@@ ter and be able to work together on the future with con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
Mr President , the v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an report g@@ i@@ v@@ es a clear over@@ view of the measures which the European Commission has taken further to ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions made by Parliament in the context of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
from that point of view , my group will support the report , and I would congratulate Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an on her ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement .
however , I would like to point out - and that is also mentioned in the report - that although some progress has been made in fi@@ ve areas , they have a long way to go yet .
this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e of ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts , im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al management and control problems , the technical assistance o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es and the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against f@@ ra@@ u@@ d and cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion .
I will not go into all these areas but h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t a few .
I believe it is of u@@ t@@ most importance for the Commission , in its at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ b@@ ly high per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of er@@ ro@@ r , to i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy the Member States which f@@ a@@ i@@ l to achieve any im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in the per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of er@@ ro@@ r in the case of the b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ est ex@@ pen@@ se it@@ em@@ s , for example .
the Member States will ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly not like this , but why could we not k@@ e@@ e@@ p a s@@ co@@ re@@ bo@@ ar@@ d for this , just as we do for the Member States &apos; per@@ for@@ man@@ ce ra@@ ting in terms of im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing European legislation ?
the more transparency , the better .
an ad@@ ded b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it is that the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments can bring their governments to bo@@ o@@ k .
in the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against f@@ ra@@ u@@ d and the c@@ a@@ re@@ less h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of European m@@ on@@ ies , we must re@@ ly far more on cooperation with national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments .
the t@@ r@@ u@@ st of the c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en in the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers that be , and s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in the European Union , is at st@@ a@@ k@@ e .
it cannot be that we here in Europe get the b@@ la@@ me for the n@@ e@@ g@@ li@@ g@@ ence and c@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ness of national governments .
in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future , the Commission will need to pu@@ l@@ l out all the st@@ op@@ s in order to set up an e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent management and control system .
we will s@@ o@@ on be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the new F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion which , I hope , will better ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ate the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of m@@ od@@ er@@ n management .
con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ity , transparency and clear com@@ p@@ et@@ ences are v@@ it@@ al par@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ ters in this .
we must a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d a situation where different bo@@ di@@ es responsible for fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting f@@ ra@@ u@@ d and cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion , such as O@@ L@@ A@@ F and the financial ir@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ities p@@ an@@ e@@ l , c@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ l each other out in their efforts .
there is nothing wor@@ se than having in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing all their energy into m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al com@@ p@@ et@@ ence @-@ based s@@ qu@@ ab@@ b@@ l@@ es .
finally , we set great st@@ or@@ e by the Court of Auditors s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing the an@@ n@@ u@@ al reports to see how the Commission has ac@@ ted upon c@@ r@@ it@@ ical re@@ mar@@ ks made pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
control without re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing back to er@@ r@@ or@@ s de@@ te@@ c@@ ted pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly is a j@@ o@@ b h@@ al@@ f @-@ done .
Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an for g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l and the European Parliament a mo@@ de@@ l on which to b@@ a@@ se future dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge reports .
from the ou@@ t@@ set she was very clear that she w@@ an@@ ted to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on a few areas where we w@@ an@@ ted to see real im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement .
they were clearly set out last year .
now we have a follow @-@ up to ch@@ ec@@ k that those points have been im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
we shall be following her le@@ a@@ d in not su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the amendments tabled because we want to k@@ e@@ e@@ p to that clear @-@ c@@ u@@ t approach .
on the whole , the Commission has res@@ p@@ on@@ ded p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y , and this now has to be set within the context of the more general Commission reform .
we are p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that the Commission will present an@@ n@@ u@@ al ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity reports for each D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al but , for that to work e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , we need to know the ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s for these D@@ G@@ s very s@@ o@@ on .
work on st@@ a@@ f@@ f policy has also g@@ one a@@ he@@ a@@ d but things se@@ e@@ m to be mo@@ v@@ ing very s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly .
we ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity of n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on st@@ a@@ f@@ f issues but we and the European public will s@@ o@@ on l@@ o@@ s@@ e pa@@ ti@@ ence if the t@@ al@@ king does not st@@ o@@ p s@@ o@@ on and the action start .
the C@@ A@@ P and S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds are the areas where most mis@@ management problems li@@ e in the EU , par@@ tly due to the sc@@ al@@ e of the fin@@ ance received by these areas .
that is why it is c@@ r@@ it@@ ical that we , as the con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ing and ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ ble b@@ od@@ y , have access to information on the financial management of these two areas .
we look forward to rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing re@@ gu@@ la@@ r reports from the P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ al R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es Group .
external aid , however , is an area where we still see su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al problems .
the rapporteur has re@@ f@@ er@@ red clearly to the dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s way the aid to P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ ine was h@@ an@@ d@@ led , which g@@ i@@ v@@ es a very p@@ o@@ or si@@ g@@ n@@ al at a time when the u@@ t@@ most political d@@ el@@ ic@@ ac@@ y and s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity were n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in that region .
another Court of Auditors &apos; report on external aid has come out very rec@@ ently and we shall be l@@ o@@ o@@ king at that in the future .
once again , I thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a j@@ o@@ b well done .
Mr President , in her report , rapporteur Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an l@@ o@@ o@@ ks at the progress which the Commission has made over the past year with regard to following re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations set out in the report on the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
she is rather p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d with the re@@ a@@ m@@ s of pa@@ per which the Commission has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
I am w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for more su@@ b@@ st@@ ance , for results .
the in@@ t@@ en@@ tions are good , but the effect will not be e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent until we see the results , once , for example , O@@ L@@ A@@ F is working t@@ r@@ u@@ ly in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ently , once the b@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ o@@ g in pa@@ y@@ ments has been c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ d , once fe@@ w@@ er er@@ r@@ or@@ s are made in pa@@ y@@ ments and once we finally g@@ a@@ in access to con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ al d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , I am un@@ con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed by all the Commission &apos; s good in@@ t@@ en@@ tions .
the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e for w@@ h@@ is@@ t@@ le @-@ b@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ers , much ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d@@ ed by Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an , le@@ a@@ v@@ es a great deal to be de@@ si@@ red .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s and transparency , the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e ex@@ u@@ d@@ es an at@@ m@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ here of d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge l@@ im@@ it@@ ation .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the new rules , w@@ h@@ is@@ t@@ le @-@ b@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ers must pro@@ ve that they have f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed the cor@@ rec@@ t procedures .
is this not a case where the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of pro@@ of should be re@@ ver@@ sed ?
we should let the Commission pro@@ ve that it ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed the procedure cor@@ rec@@ tly .
Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an de@@ v@@ o@@ tes much th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to the aid to the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an regions and dis@@ pla@@ y@@ s an a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ g@@ re@@ e of f@@ a@@ it@@ h in the dec@@ is@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the European Union &apos; s d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in the process .
I would like to see a report in which the role of our P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ part is ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed .
mo@@ re@@ over , the recent ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tions force us to re@@ v@@ is@@ it the conditions for European aid .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , I would draw everyone &apos; s attention to the fact that the te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al in P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s con@@ ta@@ in@@ s many an@@ t@@ i @-@ S@@ em@@ it@@ i@@ c st@@ a@@ te@@ ments , which , in our countries , would f@@ all under the he@@ ad@@ ing of in@@ c@@ it@@ ement to ra@@ c@@ i@@ al ha@@ t@@ red .
European aid must s@@ er@@ ve peace .
that is why I have tabled an amendment in which I ur@@ ge the Commission not to support the s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing of an@@ t@@ i @-@ S@@ em@@ it@@ is@@ m in sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ bo@@ o@@ ks in any way .
there should be no question of European money being used to pa@@ y for the s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing of ra@@ c@@ is@@ t v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
I therefore he@@ ar@@ ti@@ ly re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d my amendment , and hope it will m@@ e@@ e@@ t with b@@ road support .
a for@@ ma@@ l con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation is not doing an@@ y@@ one any good .
, C@@ ha@@ ir@@ per@@ s@@ on of the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l . ( de ) Mr President , it is a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing that the follow @-@ up report on the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge se@@ em@@ s to be g@@ en@@ er@@ ating far more interest this time than the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge itself , which was , in fact , pre@@ pa@@ red by the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous Parliament .
I welcome this with open ar@@ m@@ s , but there is nothing new in the fact that we have com@@ p@@ il@@ ed such a report and are st@@ ic@@ king to it , as we v@@ o@@ w@@ ed to at the time .
yet I believe we have done j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to our ta@@ s@@ k of ver@@ i@@ f@@ ying whether the Commission has m@@ e@@ t our d@@ em@@ an@@ ds in relation to the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
I am extremely p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that the rapporteur has taken all these issues up again and would like to congratulate her to this effect . however , I am also d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to be able to te@@ l@@ l the Commission that it has f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed these d@@ em@@ an@@ ds extremely well .
we are t@@ al@@ king conditions , and not just com@@ ments .
however , there are still a few matters to be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed .
this is also clearly b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t out in the report , by the way .
I would s@@ in@@ g@@ le out the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e of ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for special m@@ en@@ tion in this respect .
it is t@@ r@@ u@@ ly al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing when we put in ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of EUR 7@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on to one si@@ d@@ e , which in@@ f@@ la@@ tes the b@@ u@@ d@@ get and is then un@@ available for other ta@@ s@@ ks that the EU has set itself .
we must do more to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le this than just com@@ p@@ il@@ e a report once every two years ; we need to c@@ u@@ t back .
Commissioner , this is a matter for you .
secondly , I do not think much to the idea of se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up a second o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e for internal in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations .
we have set up O@@ L@@ A@@ F and ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te far more on en@@ sur@@ ing that O@@ L@@ A@@ F is able to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out its work pro@@ per@@ ly and in an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er , particularly its internal in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations .
I believe it is important for us to u@@ p@@ h@@ ol@@ d the d@@ em@@ and that we raised during the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge process , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that of c@@ re@@ ating a dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary c@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , which could be at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to the Court of Auditors or the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
I would re@@ mind the Commission not just to issue st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on this , but also pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a legal basis .
finally , I would like to say a b@@ i@@ g thank you for the efforts made in respect of the G@@ a@@ z@@ a h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al .
I was there m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that after all these years , it has at long last st@@ ar@@ ted work and is e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently s@@ er@@ v@@ ing the people well .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ta@@ way from where Mrs T@@ he@@ a@@ to le@@ f@@ t o@@ f@@ f .
Commissioner , we are actually fin@@ ding it quite h@@ ar@@ d to i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine what the point would be of having an ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e for financial ir@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ities of the kind you en@@ v@@ is@@ age .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the new ag@@ ency for internal ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations that the Commission is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to set up .
what pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e would this o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e and ag@@ ency actually s@@ er@@ ve , when by the Commission &apos; s own dec@@ re@@ e , O@@ L@@ A@@ F is responsible for all serious b@@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ es of d@@ u@@ ty against the interests of the Community , and not just for f@@ ra@@ u@@ d @-@ re@@ la@@ ted o@@ f@@ f@@ ences ?
I would re@@ mind you once again that you , y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f , dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed that that is how it should be , yet you are e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently on the point of al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing some kind of p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ less su@@ per@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture to form part of your proposals .
Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an &apos; s report quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ s that the Commission has not yet made su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent progress on the per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l policy f@@ r@@ on@@ t for Parliament &apos; s ta@@ st@@ e .
this particularly ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the already long over@@ due reform of the dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedure .
of course , this has a great deal to do with the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , because one th@@ ing that also concerns us is the issue of the li@@ ability of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als in respect of d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge they cause .
do Commission o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als have to de@@ f@@ ra@@ y the costs of d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge they cause , themselves , at least as far as their financial means per@@ m@@ it ?
in principle , the an@@ s@@ w@@ er to this question has long been &apos; y@@ es &apos; .
only , the cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ding pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 7@@ 3 and 7@@ 4 of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion have n@@ e@@ v@@ er actually been ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in a s@@ in@@ g@@ le case yet .
the ex@@ c@@ use used was always that the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant procedures were un@@ clear .
an@@ y@@ one h@@ op@@ ing that this will now change under the reform process has been dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted so far .
it is this very issue , an ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al one , that the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion pa@@ per on the reform of the dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedure put forward by V@@ ice @-@ President K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k on 2@@ 9 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er , i@@ g@@ no@@ res , and it p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ es a res@@ p@@ on@@ se until a la@@ ter d@@ ate .
understand that if you will , because I find it in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble .
this House has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly and clearly op@@ p@@ o@@ sed this and called for an external c@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er for b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine to be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed at the European Court of Auditors or Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice , which should be called in w@@ h@@ en@@ ever the financial ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ bility of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als is at issue .
this d@@ em@@ and from the report by Mr v@@ an H@@ ul@@ t@@ en on the reform of the Commission has now been on the ta@@ ble since J@@ an@@ u@@ ary last , and was ex@@ p@@ res@@ s@@ ly r@@ e @-@ con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in the S@@ ta@@ un@@ er report on the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
I also believe that this dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , the excellent report by Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an , le@@ a@@ v@@ es these issues , which are key to the c@@ re@@ di@@ bility of EU ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion , un@@ res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed .
we have p@@ o@@ in@@ ted the way , and now all we can do , Commissioner , is to in@@ v@@ ite you to follow it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the follow @-@ up measures to the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the year 2001 , is , to my mind , rather an@@ ac@@ h@@ r@@ on@@ is@@ ti@@ c in pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l terms , given that the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge procedure was con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded more than si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago and the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y committee responsible is already working on the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge for 1999 .
a m@@ od@@ er@@ n , e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion should res@@ p@@ on@@ d for@@ th@@ with to Parliament &apos; s c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m and re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement , particularly when mis@@ d@@ em@@ e@@ an@@ ou@@ r@@ s need to be de@@ al@@ t with .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now to matters of con@@ t@@ ent , despite some welcome progress , the fact re@@ ma@@ in@@ s that key d@@ em@@ an@@ ds l@@ o@@ d@@ ged by Parliament have not been f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed and are therefore to be carried over into the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge procedure for su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ent years , which means that the clear d@@ el@@ im@@ it@@ ation we de@@ si@@ r@@ e will become more b@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ red .
there are two points in particular I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t . I am at a l@@ o@@ s@@ s as to why the Commission has , as yet , f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to take st@@ e@@ p@@ s to set up a c@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er for b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine at the Court of Auditors or the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice , and so guarantee the effective ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion concerning the financial li@@ ability of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als for d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge they cause .
how many ti@@ m@@ es do we have to ask , ur@@ ge , be@@ se@@ ec@@ h - and I do not know what el@@ se - the Commission to get r@@ ou@@ n@@ d to doing something at long last ?
su@@ re@@ ly this is a re@@ as@@ on@@ able d@@ em@@ and ?
the same g@@ o@@ es for our d@@ em@@ and that Parliament , as a dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity , should be given at least the same a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of access to the Commission as the Court of Auditors .
after all , the d@@ u@@ ty to provide information is clearly Treaty @-@ based , i@@ .@@ e@@ . it d@@ er@@ i@@ v@@ es from A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 7@@ 6 of the Treaty of R@@ om@@ e .
in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , it also se@@ em@@ s to me that the ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , which was mentioned e@@ ar@@ li@@ er , would be sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s to re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , and I do not in@@ t@@ end to go into this matter any further at the present time since pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have already taken c@@ are of it .
however , both d@@ em@@ an@@ ds are re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted in our amendments and I consider them in@@ dis@@ pu@@ ta@@ ble .
I would ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate your support in this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an . I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report , and to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my u@@ t@@ ter ad@@ m@@ i@@ ra@@ tion for the way in which she com@@ p@@ le@@ ted the ta@@ s@@ k , the s@@ k@@ il@@ l with which she h@@ an@@ d@@ led the matter , without g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing carried a@@ way by the ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses which are always possible in the matter of dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , as we have already seen .
I believe the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge procedure is a very important one , which should be h@@ an@@ d@@ led with c@@ are , as the sa@@ ying g@@ o@@ es , and I think it is re@@ as@@ on@@ able for Parliament to look into the sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s de@@ te@@ c@@ ted in the management of public m@@ on@@ ies , of which there have been many in recent years , g@@ en@@ er@@ ally att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ta@@ ble , it must be said , to the Member States .
this is a point to which we shall re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n when dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing other Court of Auditors reports .
I think that Parliament must f@@ o@@ c@@ us especially on this as@@ p@@ ec@@ t during this term of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e .
there were also sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s within the Commission .
dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge for 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 was a rather special case , co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ing as it did with an extremely difficult time for the Commission .
I think the report , and the way it has been se@@ t@@ t@@ led , and the way I should like to see it defin@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y se@@ t@@ t@@ led without it for@@ c@@ ing us to take another t@@ u@@ r@@ n ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge procedure , will en@@ able us to look to the future , taking as our mo@@ de@@ l , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , this dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge which is the f@@ r@@ u@@ it of l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ation by Parliament and which has given r@@ ise to certain res@@ p@@ on@@ ses from the Commission .
we have ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed these res@@ p@@ on@@ ses , and have f@@ ou@@ n@@ d the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of them sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y , as is rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed .
a new approach has now been adopted to ensure that dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es are con@@ fin@@ ed to the b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s of the b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
I think we are mo@@ v@@ ing in the right di@@ rec@@ tion and , in this s@@ p@@ ir@@ it , we shall be v@@ o@@ ting in favour of the v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an , the Commission w@@ el@@ comes your report .
you have as@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed that in most areas that were c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l to the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge procedure the measures taken by the Commission m@@ er@@ it ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l because we are he@@ ad@@ ing in the right di@@ rec@@ tion .
I might therefore v@@ en@@ ture , at the start of this new year , to take p@@ le@@ a@@ sure in the fact that Parliament has com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed the Commission .
but I want to do more than just give p@@ at@@ s on the back , and in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d go on to look at the areas where you continue to v@@ o@@ ice c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m or rather , d@@ em@@ and that further measures be taken , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y in the fi@@ el@@ ds of st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing policy and external aid .
as far as st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing policy is concerned , in your report you s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally f@@ o@@ c@@ used on the issue of the legal basis for the e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
I would again draw attention to the fact that , before C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s , the Commission adopted a proposal that is now under@@ going the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure between the institutions and will be for@@ w@@ ar@@ ded to Parliament in F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary .
the key fi@@ gu@@ res are as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws : it should be possible for 6@@ 00 people to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
however , o@@ w@@ ing to b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y n@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ ity there are to be only 2@@ 4@@ 8 new ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ments .
who will qu@@ al@@ i@@ fy for the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e ?
it is con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al on the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al being at least 5@@ 0 years of age and having been in s@@ er@@ v@@ ice for at least t@@ en years .
the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e also makes pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to a per@@ s@@ on &apos; s age and s@@ er@@ v@@ ice a@@ f@@ f@@ il@@ i@@ ation , for 6@@ 0 @-@ 7@@ 0 % of their s@@ al@@ ary to be c@@ ou@@ n@@ ted as e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment money .
it is a v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
n@@ or is there any legal ent@@ it@@ l@@ ement , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , the Commission , using objective c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , will s@@ el@@ ec@@ t who is able to take up e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment , th@@ e@@ re@@ by en@@ sur@@ ing that the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t of the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise , i@@ .@@ e@@ . an over@@ all increase in e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency on the st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing f@@ r@@ on@@ t , is actually ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
the second as@@ p@@ ec@@ t re@@ la@@ ting to st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing policy concerns the dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedure .
in its J@@ an@@ u@@ ary report , Parliament proposed that an external c@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er for b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine should be set up within the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice or Court of Auditors .
you have also mentioned this proposal again today .
I think I should just r@@ u@@ n through the reasons again - which my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e N@@ e@@ i@@ l K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k has ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed in great de@@ ta@@ i@@ l - as to why the Commission has d@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ ed itself from this proposal .
the European T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es as@@ si@@ g@@ n specific ta@@ s@@ ks to the Court of Auditors and to the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y . the Court of Auditors is responsible for the external control of fin@@ an@@ c@@ es and it is the role of the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice to over@@ see the dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedures pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by the Commission should the need ar@@ ise .
as the Commission se@@ es it , it would le@@ a@@ d to con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts of interest if the C@@ ou@@ r@@ ts were to be di@@ rec@@ tly involved in the Commission &apos; s internal procedures .
the Commission would also point out that , in all international organisations , it is the institutions themselves that are responsible for dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ing their st@@ a@@ f@@ f .
the Commission is con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that the same should apply here .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , there is a need for action .
that much is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous having v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed the matter ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
we adopted the proposals that are now under@@ going the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure , and which Mr B@@ ö@@ s@@ ch mentioned , even before the end of the year .
firstly , we are t@@ al@@ king in terms of st@@ e@@ p@@ s that can be taken di@@ rec@@ tly , without ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te , and secondly , there are st@@ e@@ p@@ s that will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e amendment of the per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te , and will therefore take a little longer to implement .
as far as the first st@@ e@@ p@@ s are concerned , it is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly v@@ it@@ al to set up an in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve and dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u within the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al for P@@ er@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l and A@@ d@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion .
in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to your qu@@ er@@ y , I can te@@ l@@ l you that the question is con@@ st@@ an@@ tly raised as to whether O@@ L@@ A@@ F is already involved in the procedure or in@@ t@@ en@@ ding to become involved before this b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u st@@ ar@@ ts work .
only if O@@ L@@ A@@ F an@@ s@@ w@@ ers this in the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve will this b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u take action .
the sc@@ en@@ ar@@ i@@ o@@ s can v@@ ar@@ y a great deal .
I would like to c@@ ite an example : se@@ x@@ u@@ al h@@ ar@@ as@@ s@@ ment in the wor@@ k@@ place .
since O@@ L@@ A@@ F may well not be called in to deal with such cases , it would , of course , be necessary to in@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ e an ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation or a dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedure .
so various areas come to mind .
I think it is an excellent idea to take a com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y approach .
we are not about to st@@ ri@@ p O@@ L@@ A@@ F of its ta@@ s@@ ks , as it were , or under@@ min@@ e its re@@ m@@ it , which was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by Parliament and the Council , because O@@ L@@ A@@ F in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations take p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ence here , and that is a fact .
secondly , it is very important for the dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary c@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l to be c@@ ha@@ i@@ red by an external ex@@ per@@ t .
this would d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that the Commission is k@@ e@@ en to implement f@@ a@@ i@@ r and objective dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ in@@ ary procedures .
I have just a few more words to say about your c@@ r@@ it@@ ical com@@ ments on f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy .
Mrs T@@ he@@ a@@ to mentioned the need to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding com@@ m@@ it@@ ments .
we su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted a report on this as part of the 2001 b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y procedure and made it clear that , of course , these ab@@ n@@ or@@ ma@@ l com@@ m@@ it@@ ments , which have long been k@@ no@@ w@@ n as d@@ or@@ man@@ t com@@ m@@ it@@ ments , must be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed as s@@ o@@ on as possible . indeed , the field of external aid is already s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing the first positive si@@ g@@ n@@ s in this respect .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now to the matter of the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al in G@@ a@@ z@@ a , which pla@@ y@@ s a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant part in the report by Mrs v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an .
there were certainly a great many in@@ f@@ u@@ ri@@ ating d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s .
indeed , there were re@@ p@@ e@@ ated and em@@ p@@ ha@@ ti@@ c d@@ em@@ an@@ ds from within this House for progress to be made and for something to be done about all the problems .
y@@ es , it is most gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al is now fully up and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing and that it has been t@@ re@@ ating pa@@ ti@@ ents since the su@@ m@@ m@@ er .
one th@@ ing I would say though , is that de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments on the political f@@ r@@ on@@ t , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent c@@ la@@ sh@@ es , have th@@ ro@@ w@@ n up b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers again .
it is even the case s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es that , o@@ w@@ ing to the b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ d@@ es in the G@@ a@@ z@@ a S@@ t@@ ri@@ p , su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ es cannot be d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red and pa@@ ti@@ ents cannot get there .
many members of st@@ a@@ f@@ f are un@@ able to re@@ ac@@ h the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al at the moment .
we really must - also within the sc@@ op@@ e of this debate - make re@@ p@@ e@@ ated c@@ al@@ l@@ s for the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence to end .
the European tax pa@@ y@@ er was w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er aid to the people of G@@ a@@ z@@ a .
it is high time the people were able to make use of it .
many th@@ an@@ ks , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place today at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .

, de@@ pu@@ t@@ is@@ ing for the rapporteur .
( E@@ s ) Mr President , I should like to be@@ g@@ in by p@@ ra@@ is@@ ing the fin@@ e work done by my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e , S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a P@@ ol@@ le@@ do , in the report he is p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing on own resources , a subject he has been following very c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y for some time .
the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get comes , in part , from the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al own resources raised by the Member States &apos; c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s services and therefore the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al role of Community legislation on gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es and se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities is to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the financial interests of the Community .
the de@@ f@@ ec@@ ts in the procedures ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to the security and guarantee system mean p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y that the cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ding Community re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e is not c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ted and has to be co@@ v@@ e@@ red by ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al G@@ N@@ P con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions from the Member States .
therefore , I understand that interest should be le@@ v@@ i@@ ed on tra@@ d@@ ers who e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y use un@@ a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ised c@@ re@@ d@@ it in their de@@ f@@ er@@ ment ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts as part of re@@ le@@ a@@ se for free c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tion op@@ er@@ ations .
the G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a P@@ ol@@ le@@ do report de@@ als with cases under Member State responsibility in which a f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to en@@ force Community legislation on se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es h@@ ar@@ m@@ s the Community &apos; s interests .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the Court of Auditors , in cases of man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities the b@@ a@@ si@@ c principle is that the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s authorities should fi@@ x the security at a level e@@ qu@@ al to the p@@ rec@@ ise a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s de@@ b@@ t where this can be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed with c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y , or if not , the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t , as e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted by the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s authorities , of the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s de@@ b@@ ts which have been , or may be , in@@ c@@ ur@@ red .
in practice , it is the security or guarantee b@@ od@@ y that as@@ se@@ s@@ ses the r@@ is@@ ks of the op@@ er@@ ation .
in order for these r@@ is@@ ks to be as@@ se@@ s@@ sed , the guarantee should be fi@@ x@@ ed at the c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st possible level to the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s de@@ b@@ t for which the security or guarantee is pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed .
if these rules were ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed , the per@@ t@@ in@@ ent financial interests would be fully pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted .
a number of di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es ar@@ ise in this and I shall h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t h@@ al@@ f a d@@ o@@ z@@ en :
first of all , there are no re@@ li@@ able st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s on the v@@ ol@@ u@@ me of gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es currently g@@ r@@ an@@ ted .
the d@@ at@@ a on these se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es , which are clearly i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting and legal terms , certainly ex@@ is@@ t@@ s in the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting de@@ par@@ t@@ ments of Member States , but there are no procedures to en@@ able it to be c@@ ol@@ la@@ ted and k@@ no@@ w@@ n at Community level .
secondly , some c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s authorities cannot - I pre@@ f@@ er to think this rather than that they do not c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ate - e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y m@@ on@@ it@@ or ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ance of the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments set out in Community legislation on gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es because of f@@ a@@ il@@ u@@ res in their ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ y op@@ er@@ ating or com@@ pu@@ ter systems and procedures .
I must st@@ res@@ s the need for the N@@ e@@ w C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter@@ ised T@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t S@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ m ( N@@ C@@ T@@ S ) to come into op@@ er@@ ation s@@ o@@ on in all the Member States and the countries as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with the common t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t system .
it is clear that the f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ ment of Community se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities will de@@ pen@@ d , to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , on the development of all the op@@ er@@ ations of the N@@ C@@ T@@ S .
to s@@ ol@@ ve the problem of the high level of un@@ dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ged t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t op@@ er@@ ations , we should em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e the importance of op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al measures and , again , the need for s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ t development of this new system .
with the m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ le guarantee c@@ er@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate system and the N@@ C@@ T@@ S we shall achieve c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ation and greater ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , in@@ com@@ p@@ le@@ te dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations must be mentioned .
at the end of the per@@ i@@ od@@ s al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed under Community rules the Member States should trans@@ f@@ er the d@@ u@@ ti@@ es co@@ v@@ e@@ red by a guarantee which are not con@@ te@@ st@@ ed into &apos; A &apos; ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts .
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly , the need for a change to Community c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s legislation in order to ensure that the se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities which guarantee the right to c@@ re@@ d@@ it should also guarantee the a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c pa@@ y@@ ments made by the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es after re@@ le@@ a@@ se of g@@ o@@ od@@ s .
F@@ i@@ f@@ th@@ ly , the large number of cases re@@ por@@ ted by the Court of Auditors in which the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts o@@ w@@ ed to the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get have not been pa@@ i@@ d or received with the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant late pa@@ y@@ ment interest .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , I should like to m@@ en@@ tion the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es g@@ i@@ v@@ ing r@@ ise to the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es and other ta@@ x@@ es ar@@ is@@ ing from T@@ I@@ R op@@ er@@ ations , which are att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ta@@ ble to in@@ effective implementation of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s and a lack of monitoring of t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t op@@ er@@ ations .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , Mr President , I want to st@@ res@@ s that the Commission must st@@ u@@ d@@ y the various problems raised and , in particular , re@@ view the com@@ pu@@ ter system in order to take into account the interest o@@ w@@ ed in this respect to the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get by the Member States .
Mr President , I want to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the important role of the Court of Auditors in pre@@ par@@ ing these reports .
I am de@@ al@@ ing with f@@ our reports re@@ la@@ ting to the d@@ a@@ ir@@ y sector , the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector and s@@ w@@ ine f@@ ever in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing to@@ ta@@ l s@@ pen@@ ding of ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 1@@ 6 b@@ il@@ li@@ on , which is a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able pro@@ por@@ tion of the b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
the st@@ u@@ d@@ y by the Court of Auditors in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es a great deal of de@@ ta@@ i@@ l and we must ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the important role it pla@@ y@@ s in as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing Parliament in its work , because , ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , without this in@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ tion between the Court of Auditors and Parliament , Parliament would be in no position to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate or j@@ u@@ d@@ ge the e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of Commission s@@ pen@@ ding .
we can also ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that the Court of Auditors pla@@ y@@ s a role in as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing the Commission to i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses in its ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion and di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es which it may not have ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed in the way Member States implement our various s@@ ch@@ em@@ es .
the Court of Auditors , in this particular report , has d@@ ra@@ w@@ n attention to the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses in the b@@ a@@ si@@ c re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y control s@@ pen@@ ding .
in the special report on the reform of the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector , the Court of Auditors has d@@ ra@@ w@@ n attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself at@@ ta@@ in@@ s its economic and social objectives .
to go back to the d@@ a@@ ir@@ y sector - there are two reports here , one re@@ la@@ ting to s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed @-@ m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er , the other to b@@ u@@ t@@ ter - we should re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that even though we have a qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system which is de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to bring production c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to the level of con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion , we still have to s@@ pen@@ d ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 3 000 million a year dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing of sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ ses , and of the s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed @-@ m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er which we pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce something like only 3@@ 7 % of it is s@@ ol@@ d at market v@@ al@@ u@@ e .
in other words , the re@@ st of it must be su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised for use in an@@ i@@ ma@@ l fe@@ ed and other things .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , in the case of b@@ u@@ t@@ ter , only 7@@ 5 % of the b@@ u@@ t@@ ter we pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce is s@@ ol@@ d at market pr@@ ic@@ es .
this i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ies the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses in the policies where we have a qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system and at the same time re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e va@@ st Community resources to su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ise sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ ses .
the Court of Auditors &apos; report - and Parliament su@@ p@@ por@@ ts this - d@@ ra@@ ws attention to the fact that we should perhaps u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e our resources better in a way that might encourage greater con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion of d@@ a@@ ir@@ y products on our European mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , rather than su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ing un@@ used qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities .
in the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector , the main concern of the Court of Auditors was the fact of over@@ com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion which has been well d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ en@@ ted and which we ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , and it also d@@ ra@@ ws attention to the fact that it is necessary in de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ing policy at all levels - Commission , Council and Parliament - to take account of market ch@@ an@@ g@@ es .
when we de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed this policy we did not f@@ o@@ re@@ see the r@@ ise in world pr@@ ic@@ es which led to g@@ ro@@ s@@ s over@@ com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion in the sector .
the report also d@@ ra@@ ws attention to the fact , and Parliament no@@ tes this , that something like 4@@ 0 % of all the EUR 1@@ 4 b@@ il@@ li@@ on s@@ p@@ ent in the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector g@@ o@@ es to 3 % of farmers , and 5@@ 4 % of farmers only get ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 5 % of the aid .
this again d@@ ra@@ ws attention to the whole th@@ r@@ u@@ st of the policy and whether or not we should re@@ view it with the idea of making it more com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with regional policy and with social policy .
these were the main concerns ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed .
we should also say in relation to the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector or to the d@@ a@@ ir@@ y sector that we have no@@ ted that the Commission has un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en a ro@@ o@@ t and b@@ r@@ an@@ ch re@@ view of the policy and has already set that st@@ u@@ d@@ y in motion .
so we look forward to its com@@ p@@ le@@ tion .
I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in the various reports .
Mr President , since the end of December 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , when the D@@ a@@ y@@ t@@ on peace acc@@ or@@ ds were con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , the European Union has con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted to peace in a major way .
a great deal of funding has been f@@ re@@ ed up for re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , the organisation of el@@ ec@@ tions , con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to human rights , et@@ c .
we also fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed 5@@ 3 % of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive Office .
the Court of Auditors &apos; S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t which is before us , is the third in a s@@ er@@ ies .
there have already been reports on the situation in M@@ o@@ st@@ a@@ r , and a second report de@@ al@@ t with the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion in for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a .
I believe that these special reports , together with the report which is now before us , have con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently made us as a European Parliament si@@ t up and f@@ ac@@ e the f@@ ac@@ ts , and also t@@ r@@ y to ac@@ t upon these reports in an effective m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
I also believe that progress has been made in this area th@@ an@@ ks to the Court of Auditors &apos; way of working , together with the follow @-@ up by Parliament , v@@ i@@ a the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l .
ladies and gentlemen , the ta@@ s@@ k of b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y control cannot be carried out from a little o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s or an o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
I believe that s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es , it is necessary to v@@ is@@ it the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant l@@ o@@ c@@ ation .
ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise in the field is necessary ; you need to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the people ; you need to know what people have to put up with there , what the conditions are .
for pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous reports , other M@@ E@@ P@@ s have been given the opportunity of going to B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a .
they le@@ ar@@ n@@ t a l@@ o@@ t from their v@@ is@@ it , and I v@@ is@@ ited the place m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f between 1@@ 6 and 1@@ 9 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er of last year . that is very important .
I would like to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate as well as under@@ line this .
in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , I le@@ ar@@ n@@ t more in those f@@ our d@@ a@@ y@@ s in S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o than I could have le@@ ar@@ n@@ t from w@@ ad@@ ing through re@@ a@@ m@@ s and re@@ a@@ m@@ s of w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al .
I would therefore like to ur@@ ge the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents to take this into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation when , at a la@@ ter d@@ ate , they dec@@ i@@ d@@ e for or against g@@ i@@ v@@ ing ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s the opportunity to have this ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence .
what was the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m about , ladies and gentlemen ?
first of all , c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m was le@@ v@@ el@@ led at the Commission for not de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ying su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent resources and st@@ a@@ f@@ f and for a B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s @-@ based management which is too c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed .
I g@@ a@@ th@@ er that this c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m by the Court of Auditors has been ac@@ ted upon by the European Commission .
all c@@ re@@ d@@ it to the Commission for this .
im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents have been made and st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing levels have in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d .
I would like to st@@ res@@ s here that the people in the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o are better or@@ g@@ an@@ ised , h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied and h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted .
that is th@@ an@@ ks to the Court of Auditors &apos; c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m and the fact that Parliament has ac@@ ted upon this c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the Commission has , under p@@ res@@ sure from the Court of Auditors , adopted a dec@@ on@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion policy , which has given the people in the S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation , but also in other d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations , more c@@ l@@ out . it has also m@@ e@@ ant that the he@@ a@@ d of the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation can m@@ e@@ e@@ t the needs on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d in a more p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful m@@ an@@ n@@ er , and has also en@@ su@@ red that all over@@ due pa@@ y@@ ments have now been c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ d .
so , as far as this is concerned , well done to the Commission .
other c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m concerned the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive &apos; s Office and how the European Union wor@@ ks with that o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e .
the European Commission has been b@@ la@@ m@@ ed for not k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing a c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e enough e@@ y@@ e on it .
th@@ an@@ ks to the Court of Auditors &apos; report and the action taken by Parliament , there is now a new m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ ity in the Office of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive .
it is indeed the case that , since M@@ ar@@ ch 1999 , there has been a new financial di@@ rec@@ to@@ r who has w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en a ver@@ it@@ able t@@ om@@ e on the rules to be f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed .
ap@@ par@@ ently , when the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive first to@@ o@@ k up o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , rather a l@@ o@@ t was being w@@ a@@ st@@ ed .
his commitment , and that of the Commission and the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e as a whole , has s@@ l@@ im@@ m@@ ed down the b@@ u@@ d@@ get of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive &apos; s Office by n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly EUR 5 million over a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of three years .
I believe that this is an extremely positive result .
mo@@ re@@ over , one of the key c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s di@@ rec@@ ted at the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive was also in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of P@@ ar@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 1@@ 7 on the conflict of interests g@@ en@@ er@@ ated by the for@@ m@@ er financial di@@ rec@@ to@@ r .
Parliament , at least in the resolution now before us , is as@@ king for a full ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation in this regard .
I have to let you know that I have now received a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment from the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , and from the Commission , and that the key c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s have been ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed in this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment .
that is why I pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e the ad@@ op@@ tion of my amendment , which ta@@ k@@ es this into account .
other c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m was ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed with regard to human rights .
I have to say that the Commission is doing a t@@ r@@ u@@ ly c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ able j@@ o@@ b on this in S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o and B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a in general .
I believe we should make more funds available to those people , but in terms of human rights , we are still w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for res@@ p@@ on@@ ses from the Commission with regard to P@@ ar@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h@@ s 2@@ 9 and 3@@ 5 .
a fin@@ al - important - point I would like to make is the rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ing th@@ em@@ e of the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a policy .
the Commission has come under very st@@ r@@ on@@ g c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m with regard to its m@@ ed@@ i@@ a policy .
it is re@@ por@@ ted that with regard to this policy , EUR 2 million &apos; s wor@@ th of e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment was su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised which was not el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble for su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ y .
I am still w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed report from the Commission .
it is in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the resolution , and so I hope that a res@@ p@@ on@@ se will be for@@ th@@ com@@ ing in the very n@@ e@@ a@@ r future .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my report is really a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of f@@ our se@@ par@@ ate reports .
from this point of view I should like to thank Commissioner S@@ ch@@ re@@ y@@ er for att@@ en@@ ding .
I hope that , through her , the man@@ ag@@ ers responsible more s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally for the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds , both in the Commission and in the Member States , will be made aware of the con@@ t@@ ent of our report and of our con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , since this matter concerns the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds , which , as we know , are g@@ en@@ er@@ ally man@@ ag@@ ed by the Member States di@@ rec@@ tly .
so , to the f@@ our d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t reports : one report on the principle of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity , one report on the development of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ es , a third report from the Court of Auditors on the European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al F@@ un@@ d and the European A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l G@@ u@@ i@@ d@@ ance and G@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e F@@ un@@ d ( G@@ u@@ i@@ d@@ ance S@@ ec@@ tion ) - M@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ res to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the employment of young per@@ s@@ ons , and a f@@ ou@@ r@@ th report on the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land and the S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al S@@ u@@ p@@ por@@ t P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me for P@@ e@@ ac@@ e and R@@ ec@@ on@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation .
regarding this last report , I should particularly like to thank the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m for its contribution .
our Committee to@@ o@@ k on bo@@ ar@@ d all the amendments they p@@ res@@ en@@ ted .
although these f@@ our su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts are quite d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t , the same s@@ or@@ t of com@@ ments can be made about them all , and these are of three t@@ y@@ p@@ es .
firstly , the major c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s which may be le@@ v@@ el@@ led at the Commission with regard to the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures which the Court of Auditors , like us , con@@ si@@ d@@ ers too time @-@ con@@ su@@ m@@ ing and too com@@ p@@ le@@ x and which o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on@@ ally h@@ in@@ d@@ er the s@@ mo@@ o@@ t@@ h r@@ un@@ n@@ ing of projects .
it must be said that the same c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s are also made of Member States .
there is n@@ e@@ v@@ er su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent monitoring once projects are under@@ way , either at gra@@ s@@ s ro@@ o@@ t@@ s or from B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
the same lack of resources and st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally re@@ mar@@ k@@ ed upon - other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have raised it on other points - even despite the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent com@@ ments by the Court of Auditors on the subject .
the Commission is currently en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in a ra@@ d@@ ical reform of its organisation and is as@@ king for ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al resources .
I hope that Parliament , which has always b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in the m@@ y@@ th of the z@@ er@@ o g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als despite the m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation in their d@@ u@@ ti@@ es , will accept the Commission &apos; s proposals and objectives and will also st@@ e@@ p up its monitoring ta@@ s@@ ks and its role .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , this will cause some over@@ la@@ p@@ p@@ ing of funding , since funding is not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently well m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d , and h@@ ence the p@@ o@@ or use of European ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations .
the fin@@ al c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m that may be made concerns the d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in pa@@ y@@ ments , a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent problem which the Commission does not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing or pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing a st@@ o@@ p to .
secondly , a major c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m that I would like us to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e in our de@@ al@@ ing with the Member States is the p@@ o@@ or use of ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations , often due to a lack of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission , and the re@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ ce of the Member States to make better use of the funds .
too often they are t@@ re@@ ated as d@@ on@@ ations , funds to be su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ted for national funds .
in some in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , the Member States at@@ ta@@ ch little importance to the principle of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity which st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tes that this is co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing which must be com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted by national fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing .
they se@@ e@@ m to think the funds co@@ v@@ er 1@@ 00 % of the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing , which is clearly not in line with the re@@ as@@ on@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds and their use .
the Member States should not for@@ get that these are public funds and , as such , the concern of all the citizens of Europe .
they should h@@ ence be used with even more c@@ are than national funds .
in order to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y such in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es , a new regulation was adopted in J@@ un@@ e 1999 , which I hope will en@@ able us to make progress .
when it un@@ co@@ ver@@ s in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es we would ur@@ ge the Commission to use all the means available to it , such as the su@@ s@@ pen@@ sion of pa@@ y@@ ments , and if there is su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fication we shall be right be@@ h@@ in@@ d the Commission in this .
finally , I think the Commission itself should pa@@ y more attention to the el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ bility c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a before a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ is@@ ing funds to be re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d .
this would pre@@ v@@ ent the funding of projects that were not v@@ i@@ able and the &apos; ra@@ g @-@ b@@ a@@ g &apos; projects that are often seen in the Member States .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es my com@@ ments .
thank you , Mr President , for the ex@@ t@@ r@@ a few se@@ con@@ ds you al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed me .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that the European Union is making con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able resources available for the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of democracy in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a and for its con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ation fully j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ ies the s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness with which we are now ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the motion for a resolution on S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t No 2 / 2000 of the Court of Auditors .
I say this because it was only at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of 2000 that the Court was able to com@@ p@@ le@@ te and ap@@ pro@@ ve its report on Community aid g@@ r@@ an@@ ted between 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , in other words , between f@@ our and two years pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of this re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble d@@ el@@ a@@ y is that many of the ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions in the report are out of d@@ ate , since , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , major ch@@ an@@ g@@ es have taken place in the legal framework and the political situation in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a .
but this does not mean that the report &apos; s ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions should not be taken into account in future , particularly in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r problems ar@@ is@@ ing with i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ c@@ al actions pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted by the Union .
this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of monitoring is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying and s@@ ol@@ v@@ ing ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing problems , which ex@@ is@@ t on two levels : one in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing di@@ rec@@ t funding and the other co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing with other d@@ on@@ or@@ s .
in the first case , one problem that st@@ an@@ ds out is the in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ac@@ y of support for actions de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t human rights , support for civil society and support for the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a .
there have been many s@@ it@@ u@@ ations which , for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ te@@ ly , have been rec@@ ti@@ fied . these r@@ an@@ ge from i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fication of c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed procedures in@@ appropriate given the ur@@ g@@ ency with which actions have to be carried out , to the fact that the Commission f@@ ou@@ n@@ d itself con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted with various f@@ a@@ its ac@@ com@@ pl@@ is which su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently had to be fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed .
with regard to co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing , we welcome the trans@@ f@@ er of fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing from the Office of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive to the first p@@ il@@ la@@ r , which m@@ e@@ ant that it had to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we believe the same will have to apply to fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing for monitoring el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al procedures and , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , to cooperation with the O@@ S@@ C@@ E .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , Mr President , these were the ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions that we in the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y f@@ el@@ t should be con@@ si@@ de@@ red in the report by Mr S@@ ta@@ es - w@@ h@@ o@@ m I congratulate - given the v@@ ol@@ u@@ me of the to@@ ta@@ l funding for this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of aid , the sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of resources and the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous need for them to be used in a ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous and trans@@ par@@ ent way .
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by w@@ el@@ com@@ ing Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a &apos;s report and its rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition that the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land and the P@@ e@@ ac@@ e and R@@ ec@@ on@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation F@@ un@@ d are an in@@ no@@ va@@ tive means of con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ating the peace process .
the difficult environment in which the F@@ un@@ ds have had to op@@ er@@ ate , their role as a pu@@ m@@ p pr@@ im@@ er , the approach in g@@ i@@ v@@ ing priority to dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged areas and the uni@@ qu@@ e role in p@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ing the j@@ o@@ in@@ t management and d@@ el@@ i@@ very of c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order programmes have all been given the rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition they d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve .
I understand that the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors &apos; report , which can be made available to Members .
that res@@ p@@ on@@ se in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a number of specific actions that the F@@ un@@ d is taking to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s matters raised in the report .
it is important to st@@ res@@ s one c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al point in relation to the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land : this is not a European Union programme .
the F@@ un@@ d is , in fact , an international organisation with its own g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing b@@ od@@ y , rules , a@@ u@@ d@@ it procedures and so on .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the European Union is just one of fi@@ ve d@@ on@@ or@@ s involved in its fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing .
the European Union &apos;s an@@ n@@ u@@ al contribution con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes 3@@ 5 % of the to@@ ta@@ l .
the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land was e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed by the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish and I@@ r@@ ish G@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ments in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 6 with the objective of pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing economic and social ad@@ v@@ ance and en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing con@@ ta@@ c@@ t , dialogue and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation between the U@@ n@@ i@@ on@@ is@@ t@@ s and N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s throughout I@@ re@@ land .
con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s to the F@@ un@@ d are the United States , the European Union , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , N@@ e@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and and A@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ a .
since the F@@ un@@ d was set up it has pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed assistance of EUR 5@@ 9@@ 7 million to 4 6@@ 00 projects , which have h@@ el@@ p@@ ed to c@@ re@@ ate 3@@ 8 000 j@@ o@@ b@@ s , le@@ ad@@ ing to an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment of ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 1@@ .@@ 1@@ 9@@ 3 b@@ il@@ li@@ on , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing the over@@ all in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in these projects to al@@ most EUR 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 9 b@@ il@@ li@@ on ; di@@ rec@@ ted al@@ most 9@@ 0 % of its com@@ m@@ it@@ ments to the most de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed areas ; en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged over 9 000 par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity groups and en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged 5 000 par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
Mr President , may I say that Mr S@@ ta@@ es has done an excellent j@@ o@@ b in his report . may I also point out to everyone that the Balkans are a se@@ par@@ ate area of Europe , both g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ ally and from the point of view of their c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s and their way of th@@ in@@ king .
so we need to st@@ u@@ d@@ y every in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent from every possible an@@ g@@ le if we are to be e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent both in our c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m and in the measures which we take .
what it comes down to , as Mr S@@ ta@@ es has said and done , is going and se@@ e@@ ing for y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f .
from where we st@@ and , we cannot see what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing in these particular regions , which are pre@@ t@@ t@@ y much a law un@@ to themselves .
we cannot m@@ on@@ it@@ or what is going on from be@@ h@@ in@@ d a d@@ e@@ s@@ k .
we cannot understand the B@@ al@@ k@@ an way of th@@ in@@ king from le@@ t@@ ters , f@@ a@@ x@@ es and e @-@ ma@@ il@@ s .
what we need to do is to get c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to them , and we need to get c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to them not just by ex@@ p@@ res@@ sing an interest which , it g@@ o@@ es without sa@@ ying , is man@@ i@@ f@@ est on all si@@ d@@ es ; we need to get c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to them in practice , both p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ ally and g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ ally , but ma@@ in@@ ly by le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing about their h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y and what makes them ti@@ c@@ k .
e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing that has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed , the com@@ ments made by the a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s and the Commission , d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that something that is good can always be re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by something that is better and that something that is better can always be made better still .
that is the di@@ rec@@ tion we are all pu@@ l@@ ling in . I am certain that the interest e@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed by us and the c@@ r@@ it@@ ical s@@ p@@ ir@@ it which ex@@ is@@ t@@ s cannot but le@@ a@@ d in the right di@@ rec@@ tion and , if you like , we can take the results of the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to this s@@ or@@ t of co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing and ad@@ ap@@ t them in other di@@ rec@@ tions .
the European A@@ g@@ ency for R@@ ec@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion is now up and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing in T@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ al@@ on@@ i@@ k@@ i and P@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ a .
it has att@@ ra@@ c@@ ted a great deal of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m , but we cannot pre@@ su@@ me that S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o is the same th@@ ing as P@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ a and we need to make that clear , which is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why I re@@ f@@ er@@ red to different w@@ a@@ y@@ s of th@@ in@@ king , c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s and s@@ it@@ u@@ ations which need to be b@@ or@@ n@@ e in mind .
many h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members - and to some ex@@ t@@ ent they are right - said that the ag@@ ency in T@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ al@@ on@@ i@@ k@@ i should be dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed and should mo@@ ve to P@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ a .
many of us c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ic@@ ally op@@ p@@ o@@ sed this as out of the question .
we have been pro@@ v@@ en right in k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing the ag@@ ency in T@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ al@@ on@@ i@@ k@@ i because if we had mo@@ v@@ ed the T@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ al@@ on@@ i@@ k@@ i ag@@ ency to P@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ a , Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a would now be un@@ able to ob@@ ta@@ in funding from the European A@@ g@@ ency for R@@ ec@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion because it would have been im@@ possible for a S@@ er@@ b to go to P@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ a and c@@ la@@ i@@ m so much as a s@@ in@@ g@@ le e@@ ur@@ o .
which is why I re@@ p@@ e@@ at that c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m is a good th@@ ing , but e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing we do must be ad@@ ap@@ ted to the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , the needs and the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ities of each region .
Mr President , I would like to start by g@@ i@@ v@@ ing my th@@ an@@ ks to the Court of Auditors for its very u@@ se@@ ful report this time on a r@@ an@@ ge of issues .
we were very c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of it at the time of the an@@ n@@ u@@ al report but I think these special reports are very v@@ al@@ u@@ able .
there are clearly a r@@ an@@ ge of areas where the Commission has yet to ac@@ t to improve matters .
today , I am going to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on a res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the report w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en by Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a on various aspects of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds .
certainly , in my country , this is one of the areas where the European Union can v@@ is@@ i@@ b@@ ly c@@ la@@ i@@ m to be making a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence , and there is a rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition that S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds and the at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to increase w@@ e@@ al@@ th , and improve social conditions and employment ra@@ tes in an area give a positive i@@ ma@@ ge of the EU .
but we cannot st@@ and by and un@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ally ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d .
the reports by the Court of Auditors clearly s@@ how that there is ro@@ o@@ m for ra@@ d@@ ical im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement , and the Commission has already in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a new S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ d regulation to improve the situation and will ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly be ch@@ ec@@ king very c@@ a@@ re@@ fully to see whether these re@@ for@@ m@@ s have g@@ one far enough .
in the case of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity , we must re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that European F@@ un@@ ds are in@@ t@@ en@@ ded not to fin@@ ance but to co@@ fin@@ ance op@@ er@@ ations and must not take the place of public ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e by national authorities .
that is all very well , but even the new re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions only allow for as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity at a national level and not at a regional level .
rules are rules , but if there is no effective pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ment after b@@ re@@ a@@ king them , they become w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er and un@@ en@@ for@@ c@@ e@@ able , so we need to see a s@@ ol@@ i@@ d legal basis to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the possible im@@ position of s@@ an@@ c@@ tions .
on the issue of the development of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ es , the Commission should not w@@ r@@ ing its h@@ an@@ ds but say that this should only be seen as part of a w@@ i@@ d@@ er policy to as@@ s@@ is@@ t S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al su@@ m@@ s go into these de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments .
in W@@ al@@ es , for example , we know that this is a clear ta@@ r@@ get ; we need clear ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s and objectives and we will be l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to se@@ e@@ ing those within the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ d programmes in future .
Mr President , I would like , in d@@ ou@@ ble @-@ qu@@ ic@@ k time , to take you through a number of ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions which concern the Court of Auditors &apos; reports which were , indeed , u@@ se@@ ful .
first of all , there is the G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a report .
I believe the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s has already made pl@@ ans to this effect , but I think it is v@@ it@@ al that we e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate the results of the committee of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y on t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
what has the Commission done so far with the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations in that report ?
next , there is the M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in report on ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
it is always an in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to@@ p@@ i@@ c , and no@@ b@@ od@@ y will d@@ en@@ y that the agricultural policy is not st@@ a@@ ti@@ c , but that it should mo@@ ve al@@ on@@ g with the ti@@ m@@ es , especially in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations within the W@@ or@@ l@@ d T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation and enlargement .
I would also like to ra@@ ise two points without making a j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment either for or against .
the following con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations are currently of importance to my group : first , what would the effect of co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing agricultural ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e be , and in@@ come al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance , in particular ?
another point , which is very to@@ p@@ ical at the moment , is an@@ i@@ ma@@ l dis@@ e@@ a@@ se control .
this is taking a h@@ u@@ ge ch@@ un@@ k out of the European b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
would it not be possible , in im@@ it@@ ation of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s in the Member States , to ob@@ ta@@ in in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce co@@ v@@ er against the ou@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ k of certain an@@ i@@ ma@@ l dis@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ s ?
could the Commission look into this matter at the e@@ ar@@ li@@ est opportunity ?
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing to the S@@ ta@@ es report , it is en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing to see that the European Union can make a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the Balkans , which is much like a h@@ or@@ n@@ e@@ t &apos; s n@@ est .
we are d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted about this , and we believe the S@@ ta@@ es report is excellent .
we particularly support the fact that it is not the Office of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive which is c@@ al@@ l@@ ing the sh@@ o@@ t@@ s ; it is the European Union which c@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ s up the funds and which will have to ch@@ ec@@ k whether these are well s@@ p@@ ent .
I would like to make a general com@@ ment on the c@@ li@@ ma@@ te of cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion which is su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to pre@@ va@@ i@@ l in the Balkans .
in our opinion , it is necessary for the Commission to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e on the way in which this should be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t Europe .
is this having an impact on European aid ?
finally , I would like to make an ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion with regard to the D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a report .
in my country , there are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations that the pr@@ ice of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ es is r@@ is@@ ing con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly th@@ an@@ ks to European aid .
this is not de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble in our e@@ y@@ es .
could something be done about this ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reports from the Court of Auditors have been given a whole new re@@ le@@ v@@ ance by the current B@@ S@@ E crisis .
the European agricultural policy must be given a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h going over .
B@@ S@@ E is only the ti@@ p of the ic@@ e@@ b@@ er@@ g .
su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ation of qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s , over@@ production and then more su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es for re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ ses , not only is all this very difficult for the or@@ d@@ in@@ ary c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ d , it is also extremely su@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ble to f@@ ra@@ u@@ d , and the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a re@@ g@@ im@@ e cannot be@@ g@@ in to c@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ i@@ on the effect .
this is very clearly b@@ or@@ n@@ e out by the M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in report .
it is to the rapporteur &apos; s c@@ re@@ d@@ it that he con@@ st@@ an@@ tly d@@ ra@@ ws attention to this , and not just in ti@@ m@@ es such as these .
unfortunately , Parliament does not have full c@@ o @-@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in agricultural matters and is therefore only able to make very l@@ im@@ ited use of the political ro@@ o@@ m for man@@ o@@ e@@ u@@ v@@ r@@ e .
the decisions are taken in the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters ; they are re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed be@@ h@@ in@@ d c@@ l@@ o@@ sed d@@ o@@ or@@ s by the national A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l M@@ in@@ is@@ ters , with their di@@ ver@@ se c@@ li@@ ent interests .
yet w@@ h@@ il@@ st they res@@ er@@ ve the right to make the decisions , they are not pre@@ pa@@ red to actually take on responsibility .
when it comes to er@@ r@@ or@@ s , mis@@ d@@ em@@ e@@ an@@ ou@@ r@@ s , ir@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ities or f@@ ra@@ u@@ d , they are not the on@@ es who im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly take responsibility ; no , they always point the fin@@ g@@ er at B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the EU in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d .
there has to be a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l change on this sc@@ or@@ e .
not only is control called for , but also political c@@ o @-@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation for Parliament in all areas of the agricultural policy .
we need more transparency and op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s .
this is not about working against the farmers ; it is about fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting for a different kind of con@@ su@@ m@@ er policy , in the interests of the farmers .
Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in has already mentioned the right key words in his report .
what we are t@@ al@@ king about here is the issue of di@@ rec@@ t aid and co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing .
something needs to change here , also in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of e@@ a@@ st@@ w@@ ar@@ ds enlargement , if we want to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e the agricultural policy in such a way that it will l@@ end itself to e@@ a@@ st@@ w@@ ar@@ ds enlargement .
even after the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , it is clear that the Council is in@@ c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of actually s@@ ol@@ v@@ ing these problems , and so to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , I would like to st@@ res@@ s once again , and this will be a matter of concern to the whole of Parliament , that Parliament needs full c@@ o @-@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation and c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on rights in agricultural policy .
Mr President , in the report of the Court of Auditors for 1999 we can re@@ a@@ d that G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and H@@ ol@@ l@@ and have been h@@ u@@ ge n@@ e@@ t pa@@ y@@ ers into the EU b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
these three countries have r@@ en@@ de@@ red account in the b@@ u@@ d@@ get of their c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es , i@@ .@@ e@@ . own resources , to a much greater ex@@ t@@ ent pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ ally than other countries .
there are large por@@ ts in these countries and a l@@ o@@ t of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic in t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t pa@@ s@@ ses through them .
both the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments of the Court of Auditors and Mr G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a P@@ ol@@ le@@ do &apos; s report fe@@ a@@ ture an em@@ b@@ ar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ing el@@ ement .
in many countries ab@@ u@@ se@@ s have been re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed , although there is no m@@ en@@ tion of countries &apos; n@@ a@@ m@@ es .
this con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently g@@ i@@ v@@ es r@@ ise to the su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion that c@@ r@@ im@@ es are mo@@ st@@ ly com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in those countries that have large t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t por@@ ts .
if there is no m@@ en@@ tion of countries &apos; n@@ a@@ m@@ es , su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion must f@@ all on G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and H@@ ol@@ l@@ and .
if they are not gu@@ il@@ ty of co@@ ver@@ ing up c@@ r@@ im@@ es and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als , they are , n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t of su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion , as the countries &apos; n@@ a@@ m@@ es are not mentioned .
h@@ u@@ ge v@@ ol@@ u@@ m@@ es of g@@ o@@ od@@ s pa@@ s@@ s through the European Union , which are then sh@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the Union from its por@@ ts .
st@@ u@@ di@@ es by both the Court of Auditors and O@@ L@@ A@@ F have s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that there is major ab@@ use as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with to@@ b@@ acc@@ o im@@ por@@ ts and t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic in particular .
it is difficult to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the ex@@ t@@ ent of this , but the si@@ z@@ e of the d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge c@@ a@@ u@@ sed to the Union is e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted to be between one and fi@@ ve b@@ il@@ li@@ on e@@ u@@ ro@@ s .
to@@ b@@ acc@@ o comes ma@@ in@@ ly into the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch and B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an por@@ ts and is trans@@ por@@ ted on through EU countries , often to the area of the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a , to M@@ on@@ t@@ en@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ o , for example .
last year the EU dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to g@@ r@@ an@@ t financial aid to M@@ on@@ t@@ en@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ o to the t@@ u@@ n@@ e of EUR 1@@ 5 million for political reasons , free of any conditions con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with the pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion of s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling .
every n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t con@@ tra@@ b@@ and to@@ b@@ acc@@ o is taken by 5@@ 0 or 7@@ 0 s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ bo@@ at@@ s from M@@ on@@ t@@ en@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ o to I@@ t@@ al@@ y from where it is d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted to EU mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts free of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ty or tax .
to pre@@ v@@ ent this s@@ or@@ t of th@@ ing from ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing , we need de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed e@@ f@@ for@@ t and an@@ s@@ w@@ ers to the problems Mr G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a P@@ ol@@ le@@ do re@@ f@@ er@@ red to in his report .
from the Union &apos; s point of view , we are t@@ al@@ king about a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t co@@ st@@ ing b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of e@@ u@@ ro@@ s .
Mr President , today &apos; s debate is certainly a welcome one , but it co@@ ver@@ s some very different su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts .
I shall therefore con@@ fin@@ e my com@@ ments to the su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts raised by Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in and Mr S@@ ta@@ es .
regarding the first of these reports , the French Members of our group cannot en@@ d@@ or@@ se its com@@ ments on b@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ at , which ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge the Council decision to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed pr@@ ic@@ es until 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 .
this is a decision we think is particularly j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ able , and one that is essential for farmers .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , we do not think that the fact that 9@@ 2 % of ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations available in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 under the dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ al m@@ e@@ a@@ sure &quot; b@@ u@@ t@@ ter for non @-@ prof@@ it organisations &quot; was s@@ p@@ ent in just three Member States , n@@ one of which is a@@ m@@ on@@ g the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st in the European Union , as the resolution points out , is wor@@ th including as a serious ar@@ gu@@ ment .
it is rather j@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing the gu@@ n to for@@ get that the p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of the development of a f@@ ou@@ r@@ th world and the im@@ p@@ o@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ment of certain social st@@ ra@@ t@@ a in our countries is a h@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ d@@ ous re@@ al@@ ity , and the re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to still v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able g@@ ro@@ w@@ th is not about to make it possible to qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly re@@ in@@ te@@ gra@@ te that sector of the population which has often been mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ is@@ ed for a long per@@ i@@ o@@ d .
we do not find the report &apos; s c@@ r@@ it@@ ical att@@ it@@ u@@ de to the aid given to the major c@@ e@@ real @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing regions to be sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y either , even though the report does , ad@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ d@@ ly , pa@@ y special attention to the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ er c@@ e@@ real @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers within the European Union .
we do not share the report &apos; s opinion , on the subject of s@@ w@@ ine f@@ ever , that p@@ i@@ g farmers should be@@ a@@ r the greater part of the financial b@@ ur@@ d@@ en involved in com@@ b@@ ating e@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ em@@ ic@@ s . one might well ask just why they should be ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to be@@ a@@ r these ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al costs when they are w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ed down by con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able costs already .
they are clearly not the parties responsible for e@@ p@@ i@@ z@@ o@@ o@@ ti@@ c dis@@ e@@ a@@ se ; they are its v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
so , un@@ less we are se@@ e@@ king , once again , to r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ise the common agricultural policy on the qu@@ i@@ e@@ t , there could be no question of acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting this proposal .
Mr S@@ ta@@ es &apos; report on European Union aid to B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ s the serious financial mis@@ management in the Office of the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive ( O@@ H@@ R ) during a d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c per@@ i@@ o@@ d , what is more , and once again , at the ex@@ pen@@ se of m@@ on@@ ies b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to the citizens of Europe .
our group also no@@ tes the request for the O@@ H@@ R and the Commission to provide information de@@ ta@@ il@@ ing the reasons le@@ ad@@ ing to this con@@ f@@ u@@ sion of interests .
n@@ or is it acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble for EUR 2 million to be al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to in@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al in the sector of .@@ .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Mr President , I would like to say a few words concerning the excellent report by Mr S@@ ta@@ es .
firstly , I would , however , like to di@@ rec@@ t my com@@ ments at you , as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u of Parliament .
it was a dis@@ gra@@ ce to this House that we had to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate such a b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive h@@ ol@@ d @-@ up over the question as to whether or not we can s@@ en@@ d the rapporteur of Parliament &apos; s Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l to B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a .
I hope that for the sa@@ k@@ e of those w@@ h@@ o@@ m we are su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to re@@ p@@ res@@ ent here , there will be no re@@ p@@ e@@ at per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
I make no b@@ on@@ es about the fact , because this is something we - m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded - n@@ or@@ m@@ ally c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise the Commission for .
this time , I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say , we are for@@ c@@ ed to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that the problem li@@ es with us , which is in@@ su@@ p@@ por@@ ta@@ ble .
secondly , this report by Mr S@@ ta@@ es ra@@ is@@ es our h@@ op@@ es in two res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts .
firstly , the Commission is rec@@ e@@ p@@ tive to new i@@ d@@ e@@ as .
a most welcome development has taken place between the first v@@ is@@ its under the le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s and the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l , and the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o as as@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed by our rapporteur , and I can only congratulate the Commission on this .
at the start of this programme for the Balkans , aid was g@@ r@@ an@@ ted in the t@@ y@@ p@@ ical EU m@@ an@@ n@@ er , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the decision was taken ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the g@@ re@@ en ta@@ ble in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te f@@ ir@@ m@@ s were then com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e the aid re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment at local level , and to di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e and d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te the funds .
this m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d has been ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed and the system al@@ most re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ised - par@@ tly under p@@ res@@ sure from this House .
it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that our initiatives are v@@ al@@ u@@ able and that the Commission is rec@@ e@@ p@@ tive to new i@@ d@@ e@@ as .
Commissioner , perhaps you could even use this rec@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s to new i@@ d@@ e@@ as , which you dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed in the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o , as an example for other d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations in other countries to follow .
Mr President , despite the resources that the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds have been de@@ v@@ o@@ ting for years to f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ ing ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al b@@ al@@ ance in the European Union , the 2@@ 5 r@@ ic@@ h@@ est regions still have a per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come two and a h@@ al@@ f ti@@ m@@ es h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er than the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st , and despite the many needs put forward by these least @-@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red regions , not all the ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed as development funds are actually used each year .
I believe we should think about the real c@@ a@@ u@@ ses be@@ h@@ in@@ d this in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble fact .
perhaps there is a lack of initiatives and the least @-@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red areas do not know how to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p .
if that is the case , we should not just c@@ ro@@ s@@ s our ar@@ m@@ s and j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy our in@@ action with the ex@@ c@@ use that we give them money but they do not use it pro@@ per@@ ly .
we should pu@@ s@@ h forward with an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al policy of an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , information , training , mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tion , con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ y and monitoring to give a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to new st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and opportunities for development and progress .
but it is also possible that what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing is that from our more de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed and more te@@ ch@@ no@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons we are being too per@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ on@@ is@@ t and d@@ em@@ an@@ ding , im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing too many re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions and conditions , and th@@ us pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing and st@@ i@@ f@@ ling the ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ ance of v@@ al@@ i@@ d i@@ d@@ e@@ as in k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing with the level of development of the regions ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed by Community policies .
perhaps we should ad@@ ap@@ t the Community policies to these regions in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the regions to ad@@ ap@@ t to an el@@ it@@ is@@ t European policy .
what is .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Mr President , I should above all like to congratulate Mr S@@ ta@@ es on a most ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding report .
his conditions of work were not the best .
it is un@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of Auditors concerning e@@ v@@ ents going back many years , but the fact is that Mr S@@ ta@@ es has done his h@@ om@@ e@@ work and g@@ one out into the field .
now , it is not that I do not t@@ r@@ u@@ st Mr S@@ ta@@ es , on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , but I too ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed to be in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , and he is right in his as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
the h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y of the Commission &apos; s d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a has become a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s st@@ or@@ y .
the Court of Auditors &apos; report con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es that the Commission &apos; s control over funds for the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive &apos; s Office and the UN , for example , has not , by any means , been good enough .
many of the problems are due to the projects having pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly been ad@@ min@@ is@@ te@@ red c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ ally from B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
now , the EU d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations on the s@@ p@@ o@@ t have been given more p@@ o@@ w@@ ers and more st@@ a@@ f@@ f .
this s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that the idea of g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations more d@@ u@@ ti@@ es and more responsibility does , in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , work in practice .
the Court of Auditors pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses that , in future , the EU should give organisations such as the UN , the O@@ S@@ C@@ E and the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive &apos; s Office a su@@ m of money which they can ad@@ min@@ is@@ ter themselves .
at the same time , the Court of Auditors would like to see ti@@ g@@ h@@ ter control .
I really do not think that this ad@@ ds up .
if we simply give money as a di@@ rec@@ t form of b@@ u@@ d@@ get aid to the organisation , then the Commission will com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly l@@ o@@ s@@ e tra@@ c@@ k of things and no longer have any control .
the issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the 1999 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge .
the Commission is c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for clear gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es from the Council and Parliament .
that is something I can well understand .
we cannot d@@ em@@ and both better control and more of a free hand .
we m@@ e@@ re@@ ly need to re@@ ta@@ in a certain de@@ g@@ re@@ e of control over ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers &apos; money .
the UN system is unfortunately b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing more and more b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c , in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent and cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t so , in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing , I have much more con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in our own EU system .
Mr President , this debate co@@ ver@@ s t@@ en special reports by the Court of Auditors on su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of such v@@ ar@@ i@@ ed k@@ in@@ ds and importance that they r@@ an@@ ge from a st@@ u@@ d@@ y of the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity in st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l actions to a specific and th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the Community c@@ e@@ re@@ als policy .
I would therefore like to l@@ im@@ it m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f to the la@@ t@@ ter issue and to be@@ g@@ in by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in and the Court of Auditors on their excellent work and by h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting the fin@@ al points of the Court &apos; s an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s .
between 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 , over@@ com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion in the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ted to over EUR 1@@ 3 b@@ il@@ li@@ on .
every European c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted more than EUR 3@@ 7 to the c@@ e@@ re@@ als b@@ u@@ d@@ get in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 .
ar@@ able c@@ ro@@ p@@ s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted 4@@ 3 % of agricultural ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e but only 1@@ 0@@ .@@ 7 % of fin@@ al production .
al@@ most 4@@ 0 % of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es w@@ ent to 3 % of farmers , and 5@@ 7 % of the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies received 4@@ .@@ 5 % of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es .
the Court of Auditors con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded from this an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s that the current system of support for farmers &apos; in@@ comes , which is based on f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s such as pr@@ ice , y@@ i@@ el@@ d or area f@@ ar@@ m@@ ed , needs to be re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by a system based on a st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d n@@ e@@ t in@@ come per f@@ ar@@ m h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ d or working uni@@ t , with f@@ ar@@ m support only being t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ red to make good any f@@ all in that in@@ come .
the C@@ O@@ M in ar@@ able c@@ ro@@ p@@ s pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st ar@@ gu@@ ment for the need to reform the C@@ A@@ P .
the th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h political re@@ m@@ od@@ el@@ l@@ ing that has been ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of G@@ er@@ many &apos; s f@@ ed@@ er@@ al government is a clear si@@ g@@ n that , even at the he@@ ar@@ t of Europe , where this C@@ A@@ P was con@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ed and where it has always f@@ ou@@ n@@ d its g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st support , it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly difficult to su@@ st@@ a@@ in an agricultural policy mo@@ de@@ l that was de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t an in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al approach , based on large @-@ sc@@ al@@ e farming .
we must come up with a rural policy g@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d towards regional needs and f@@ a@@ ir@@ ness between farmers if we are to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve Europe &apos;s cultural heritage and the environment .
this will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e reform of the current C@@ A@@ P .
Mr President , I shall com@@ ment on certain problems raised by Mr D@@ el@@ l &apos; A@@ l@@ b@@ a &apos; s report to which I should like to draw your attention .
the measures to as@@ s@@ is@@ t young farmers se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up in b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s are in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , since in far too many cases the ta@@ r@@ get group ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ s the age l@@ im@@ it on the d@@ ate of rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing aid even though it was el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble at the moment of p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing an ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation .
given the difficult s@@ it@@ u@@ ations ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed by a large number of these young people and the h@@ ar@@ d@@ sh@@ i@@ p f@@ ac@@ ed by people working in that sector , a situation where some of them cannot rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve European and national aid due to in@@ acc@@ u@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es and d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the measures to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the employment of young per@@ s@@ ons , we would need a p@@ rec@@ ise as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment before being able to consider the impact of this policy .
this as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment should take account of the v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of r@@ ou@@ tes to employment to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the measures for the re@@ development of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ es , on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , the funding has been too g@@ en@@ er@@ ous , since the E@@ R@@ D@@ F aid has been used to f@@ un@@ d projects of t@@ y@@ p@@ es other than the development of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ es .
this is com@@ p@@ ou@@ n@@ ded by the fact that different for@@ m@@ s of aid , if not co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated at regional level , can en@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ er com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between pr@@ om@@ o@@ ters and a su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ent sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing of aid and re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
this does not make it possible to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t a re@@ development policy which ta@@ k@@ es account of the di@@ ag@@ no@@ si@@ s of needs and the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ents , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly en@@ ab@@ ling the ac@@ tive ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of regional development .
in this respect , I cannot go without m@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ ing the re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed by the D@@ an@@ one Group , a procedure we find in various Member States .
we cannot t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate f@@ ir@@ m@@ s which have been able to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve European su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es being al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed , even though they are in good financial s@@ ha@@ p@@ e , to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e , for reasons of st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ments , to la@@ y o@@ f@@ f th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people and c@@ a@@ using as many family c@@ r@@ is@@ es which , once again , will be a d@@ ra@@ in on national and European public m@@ on@@ ies .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , one of the major objectives of the European Union is to com@@ b@@ at un@@ employment , which is a priority of the Member States but also of the Commission .
we know how difficult it is to re@@ ac@@ h the whole of a ta@@ r@@ get group with any m@@ e@@ a@@ sure .
however , in view of the in@@ acc@@ u@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es and sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s that have been ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed , d@@ em@@ an@@ ds have been p@@ res@@ en@@ ted to have the necessary ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents made im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly , in particular in order to better defin@@ e the measures and to actually pa@@ s@@ s the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it on to the re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ ents by c@@ ur@@ ta@@ il@@ ing d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in the h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of cases and the pa@@ y@@ ment of b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies , in order to ensure that the results ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed are .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for the specific re@@ f@@ er@@ ences in his report to two major f@@ un@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land re@@ la@@ ting to our peace process and for his positive res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land , which is f@@ un@@ d@@ ed not just by Europe but also by the United States , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and A@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ a .
I would ad@@ v@@ ise other regions with serious problems of un@@ employment to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the work of the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land and the b@@ order c@@ ou@@ n@@ ti@@ es .
it has done such ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding work .
for example , it has f@@ un@@ d@@ ed some 4 6@@ 00 projects , c@@ re@@ ating 3@@ 8 000 j@@ o@@ b@@ s , and al@@ most 9@@ 0 % of these j@@ o@@ b@@ s are in areas of high un@@ employment and in de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed areas .
some 9 000 people from c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity groups have been involved in these projects for c@@ re@@ ating j@@ o@@ b@@ s in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land and some 5 000 people have been involved in the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order projects .
it has done an ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding j@@ o@@ b and I welcome the positive res@@ p@@ on@@ se in the report to it .
there is also the S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al P@@ e@@ ac@@ e P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me from the European Union itself .
at gra@@ s@@ s @-@ ro@@ o@@ t@@ s level in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land it too is b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing together people from both se@@ c@@ tions of our com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , in particular with projects for young people - young men and women .
there are s@@ ha@@ red @-@ c@@ ity initiatives to promote com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity ; there is development and training for un@@ em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed women - I am just s@@ in@@ g@@ ling out some of the very su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful op@@ er@@ ations that are going on - the development of the food industry and , of course , the new h@@ ou@@ s@@ ing development .
we very much welcome and de@@ e@@ p@@ ly thank the Commission for this , and the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters for the S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al P@@ e@@ ac@@ e P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me for N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land .
I should like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my de@@ e@@ p gra@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de to all my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in this Parliament for their un@@ an@@ im@@ ous support for this peace pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country .
Mr President , as a Member of Parliament re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing that part of I@@ re@@ land which b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its from both the I@@ F@@ I and the P@@ e@@ ac@@ e and R@@ ec@@ on@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation F@@ un@@ d , I would like to p@@ ra@@ ise the tra@@ c@@ k rec@@ or@@ d of both these funds , and as a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive who wor@@ ks c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y with the local groups and projects making excellent use of the funds I would like to state that I am per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied that all m@@ on@@ ies dis@@ b@@ ur@@ sed through the funds are ri@@ g@@ or@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ted for .
the I@@ F@@ I and the P@@ e@@ ac@@ e F@@ un@@ d are uni@@ qu@@ e funds so it is under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ able that certain mis@@ under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s should have ar@@ is@@ en o@@ w@@ ing to a lack of f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ ar@@ ity with the special nature and op@@ er@@ ation of these funds .
as was p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , A@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ a and N@@ e@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and .
the F@@ un@@ d has com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of £ 4@@ 00 million which has t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ red an in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment of £ 1@@ .@@ 2 b@@ il@@ li@@ on c@@ re@@ ating 3@@ 8 000 j@@ o@@ b@@ s for 1@@ 5@@ 0 projects right ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the b@@ order countries and N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land .
I de@@ e@@ m it w@@ h@@ ol@@ ly in@@ appropriate that the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l should question the e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the I@@ F@@ I funding system .
I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a should f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ ar@@ ise h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f a little more in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l with these funds .
I would in@@ v@@ ite h@@ i@@ m to v@@ is@@ it N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land and the b@@ order countries and to see the situation for h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f .
Mr President , it was with great ap@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion that we re@@ a@@ d the M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in report , which , I re@@ g@@ re@@ t , we did not dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s until y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
quite f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly , we were rather per@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ed at the e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ations it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s regarding the agricultural sector , for , if the d@@ at@@ a and fi@@ gu@@ res are to be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted so h@@ ar@@ sh@@ ly for a sector which is under@@ going such great , all @-@ en@@ com@@ pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing change as the world of ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture is due to the common agricultural policy , we are concerned about the decisions to be adopted .
of course , the rapporteur , Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in , has re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed a p@@ at@@ h to take : a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h re@@ view must be carried out of the agricultural sector and the rules g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing it .
it is re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble that the c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on process on the decisions to be adopted for ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture was not c@@ l@@ o@@ sed at the Nice Council .
there will certainly be a great deal to do in that area .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to thank Mr G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a , Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in , Mr S@@ ta@@ es and Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a for their reports on the reports by the Court of Auditors , which to@@ ta@@ l t@@ en in all and co@@ v@@ er the per@@ i@@ o@@ d 1999 / 2000 , or were pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in addition .
I feel this debate has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n how v@@ al@@ u@@ able the S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ ts by the Court of Auditors are , because they in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate particular pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c areas in great de@@ ta@@ i@@ l .
as Commissioner , I can only welcome these S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ ts with open ar@@ m@@ s because they en@@ able us to deal with c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s as they ar@@ ise , and the Court of Auditors con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ts its S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ ts so well that they can have a di@@ rec@@ t be@@ ar@@ ing on new Commission proposals .
of course , I must be b@@ ri@@ e@@ f and I am only able to go into some aspects of Parliament &apos; s very de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed and v@@ al@@ u@@ able reports . firstly I will deal with the report by Mr G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a , and then I will consider your com@@ ments on the own resources , Mr P@@ om@@ é@@ s R@@ u@@ i@@ z .
EUR 1@@ 4 b@@ il@@ li@@ on is raised an@@ n@@ u@@ ally in c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es , for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing the EU b@@ u@@ d@@ get , and a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al pro@@ por@@ tion of this a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t is ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ted for by se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es .
over the last few years , the Commission has en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red to su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally improve the legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in this area .
I might m@@ en@@ tion that in 1999 and 2000 , new legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on the t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t procedure in the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s field en@@ te@@ red into force .
they allow for better monitoring of t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses and the h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding these pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
the Community C@@ u@@ st@@ o@@ m &apos; s C@@ od@@ e has just rec@@ ently been a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed and the amendment has en@@ te@@ red into force .
last year , se@@ v@@ en Member States were con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted up to the new com@@ pu@@ ter @-@ su@@ p@@ por@@ ted t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t procedure .
Parliament in@@ it@@ i@@ ated a great deal in this area through its committee of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y , which pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed some very p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al results that are now being wor@@ k@@ ed on by the Commission .
above all , it is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant that the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries are now to be di@@ rec@@ tly involved in this com@@ pu@@ ter system , i@@ .@@ e@@ . in this new procedure .
there are two on@@ going se@@ ts of in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ement pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s against G@@ er@@ many re@@ la@@ ting to the consequences of im@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ et@@ y in respect of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s procedures , and the question as to whether this should att@@ ra@@ c@@ t interest pa@@ y@@ ments , and con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation is being given to in@@ v@@ o@@ king si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s against A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k .
in addition , I might point out that at some point in the next few d@@ a@@ y@@ s , the Commission will present its report on the own resources system for the per@@ i@@ o@@ d 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 @-@ 1999 .
all in all , it is the Commission &apos; s in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to trans@@ f@@ er more responsibility to the Member States in the c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s field .
I take the view that in the e@@ v@@ ent of ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive er@@ ro@@ r which le@@ ad@@ s to l@@ o@@ s@@ ses in c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e , a different re@@ g@@ im@@ e should apply in future to the one currently in force , i@@ .@@ e@@ . it is the Member States themselves that should be li@@ able for the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e in the e@@ v@@ ent of er@@ ro@@ r .
it is quite simply a b@@ a@@ d system , in that the last p@@ il@@ la@@ r of fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing within the EU b@@ u@@ d@@ get has to come into pla@@ y in such c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , i@@ .@@ e@@ . all Member States then have to pa@@ y acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to their share of G@@ N@@ P .
in other words , the present system is such that those who p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ise s@@ l@@ op@@ p@@ y management are re@@ w@@ ar@@ ded , w@@ h@@ il@@ st those who make a special e@@ f@@ for@@ t are , in fact , the m@@ u@@ g@@ s .
it ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be the F@@ in@@ ance M@@ in@@ is@@ ters &apos; first priority to want to change a system of this kind .
there is no si@@ g@@ n of this ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing yet , but the Commission will continue to p@@ res@@ s the point .
I will now t@@ u@@ r@@ n now to the extremely important report on ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture by Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in .
I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my gra@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de for these reports .
they co@@ v@@ er the following su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts : m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er , b@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ at , c@@ e@@ re@@ als and s@@ w@@ ine f@@ ever .
I have se@@ ver@@ al b@@ ri@@ e@@ f com@@ ments to make on these , and , Mrs R@@ ü@@ h@@ le , all I can say is how right you are that this report too il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes , once again , the number of areas in which ur@@ g@@ ent re@@ for@@ m@@ s are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
we have one sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s in the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e area of m@@ il@@ k production , and this c@@ a@@ u@@ ses a whole h@@ o@@ s@@ t of other problems , particularly in terms of financial control , because this sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s has led to specific s@@ al@@ es pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion measures for s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed @-@ m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er and b@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ at , which ra@@ ise en@@ or@@ m@@ ous problems for financial control time and again , or , to put it another way , they c@@ re@@ ate opportunities for f@@ ra@@ u@@ d .
the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m raised in the S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t pr@@ om@@ p@@ ted the Commission to improve on and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y f@@ our aspects re@@ la@@ ting to s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed m@@ il@@ k .
the defin@@ ition of s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed @-@ m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble for financial aid was st@@ a@@ ted more p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y , the control procedures , particularly in relation to the de@@ te@@ c@@ tion of the p@@ res@@ ence of w@@ h@@ e@@ y in s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed @-@ m@@ il@@ k p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er , were re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed , and the aid for li@@ qu@@ i@@ d s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ed m@@ il@@ k d@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ ed for use in an@@ i@@ ma@@ l fe@@ ed was ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed following a c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , which is something that att@@ ra@@ c@@ ted a great deal of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m .
this was a necessary m@@ e@@ a@@ sure though , because the v@@ e@@ h@@ em@@ ence of the Court of A@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or &apos; s c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m on this point m@@ e@@ ant that st@@ e@@ p@@ s had to be taken .
on the subject of b@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ at - there is also an issue here ar@@ is@@ ing from the over@@ production that o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ s in this sector - I can con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that the fact that pa@@ y@@ ment of aid is con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted on only a few Member States is to be re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed at the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the m@@ il@@ k sector .
this con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion is not un@@ u@@ su@@ al but we will take up your com@@ ments on this again n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s .
the Court of A@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or &apos; s ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions with regard to sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s in the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise of control are currently being given con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation under the c@@ le@@ ar@@ ance of ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts procedure .
the Court of Auditors as@@ se@@ s@@ sed the reform measures in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 2 in the third S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t on the effects on the c@@ e@@ re@@ als sector .
the Commission used these measures as the basis for its own as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment .
in the motion for a resolution , Parliament , and y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f , Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in , call for di@@ rec@@ t pa@@ y@@ ments to be di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ated , in a b@@ i@@ d to re@@ d@@ res@@ s the currently u@@ n@@ e@@ v@@ en d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of in@@ comes between pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous and less pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous regions , but also between large and small f@@ ar@@ m@@ s .
this would be possible subject to certain con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts , although not all Member States would accept it , and there is ro@@ o@@ m for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement here too .
you also ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the important issue of co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of di@@ rec@@ t aid in the report .
we know what b@@ ec@@ a@@ me of this matter in A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 .
however , the Commission fe@@ el@@ s that this is another to@@ p@@ i@@ c that must be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t up for discussion again in the course of the m@@ i@@ d@@ term re@@ view .
very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly on the subject of s@@ w@@ ine f@@ ever : the Commission is of the same mind as those who feel that after the last e@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ em@@ ic , there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need to re@@ v@@ ise the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons .
it has therefore su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted proposals acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , and , has also re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red the Commission &apos; s v@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ary s@@ er@@ v@@ ice as a result .
the Commission would agree with you , Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in , that p@@ i@@ g pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers should c@@ ar@@ r@@ y a greater share of the financial b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of measures to com@@ b@@ at an@@ i@@ ma@@ l dis@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ s .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , the Commission will c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out an in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation into r@@ is@@ k management in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , the fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s of which will be available in the next few m@@ on@@ th@@ s , and they are b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to be the subject of in@@ t@@ en@@ se discussion in this House th@@ e@@ re@@ after .
I will now t@@ u@@ r@@ n to your report Mr S@@ ta@@ es , for which the Commission is in your de@@ b@@ t .
in the per@@ i@@ o@@ d from 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , which is the per@@ i@@ o@@ d the Court of A@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or &apos; s S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t re@@ la@@ tes to , the Commission - and you ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ged this - op@@ er@@ ated under extremely difficult political conditions on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
you m@@ en@@ tion the ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , particularly with regard to the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of the open b@@ ro@@ ad@@ c@@ a@@ st@@ ing n@@ et@@ work .
firstly , it was necessary for e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment of a very high quality to be made available for this n@@ et@@ work , and secondly , it was important to ensure that the trans@@ mis@@ sion of information was of a very high quality too , with a view to pre@@ par@@ ing for the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 el@@ ec@@ tions , and al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing for in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent re@@ por@@ ting .
however , the Commission is for@@ c@@ ed to con@@ c@@ ed@@ e that , in many areas , there was much cause for c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m and so it has taken the appropriate st@@ e@@ p@@ s .
I will go on to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p between the EU as d@@ on@@ or , and the Office of H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive and the O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation for S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation in Europe as re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ ents of the financial aid .
this re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p is indeed com@@ p@@ le@@ x .
the Commission has been re@@ pr@@ im@@ an@@ ded for quite a few ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s , when the f@@ a@@ ul@@ t actually li@@ es with the international organisations .
it is not a case of d@@ en@@ ying responsibility .
it just g@@ o@@ es to s@@ how that there are even di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es on the cooperation f@@ r@@ on@@ t s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es , which are par@@ tly st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l in nature .
the Court of Auditors is now pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing , as it did back in its 1999 A@@ n@@ n@@ u@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t , that international organisations should not be g@@ r@@ an@@ ted pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing but should be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y g@@ r@@ an@@ ts in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d .
but how is the Commission su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to support international organisations with an ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y political man@@ d@@ ate when these organisations find it difficult to pro@@ per@@ ly implement the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive and financial st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds of Community aid programmes ?
further t@@ al@@ ks and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions are called for here .
on the subject of the re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of h@@ ou@@ s@@ ing in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a , which also fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res in the report : the Commission was able , with the aid of projects fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed by the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E and O@@ B@@ N@@ O@@ V@@ A programmes , to achieve si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses where re@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ ing is concerned to those of other d@@ on@@ or@@ s .
a c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m was raised in the 1999 A@@ n@@ n@@ u@@ al R@@ e@@ por@@ t to the effect that there were sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s with regard to the re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , but this situation has now im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed .
I would also re@@ mind you once again that the Commission has le@@ ar@@ n@@ t from all the er@@ r@@ or@@ s com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a when it c@@ a@@ me to g@@ r@@ an@@ ting EU aid , and has taken the necessary st@@ e@@ p@@ s , and it has also pla@@ c@@ ed the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of EU aid , for example in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , on an en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly different f@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ ing .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now to the com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve report by Mr D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a , which concerns the principle of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity as ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds , in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al areas , y@@ ou@@ th employment initiatives , the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ un@@ d for I@@ re@@ land and the P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E programme .
here , too , I must con@@ fin@@ e m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f to a few re@@ mar@@ ks .
the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l funds regulation of J@@ un@@ e 1999 now in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es new pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons regarding the principle of the ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ ity of measures , which will h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly help to ensure that , in future , there will be no more cause for the kind of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m raised by the Court of Auditors about the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous support per@@ i@@ o@@ d , and the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a will be c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r .
I have this to say about the Court of A@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or &apos; s report on in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al areas : one of the key aspects of the 1999 reform of the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l funds has been the st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing of the monitoring and as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , which will en@@ able us to establish more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y where the money g@@ o@@ es to .
the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions now provide for a c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States .
finally , per@@ m@@ it me just to say a few words about the report on the P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E programme .
Parliament has ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d concern at the often s@@ l@@ o@@ w @-@ mo@@ v@@ ing ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E programme in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land and has called for a trans@@ par@@ ent b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
the f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ ance of the con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ation of the peace process in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land and the support , particularly of the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order cooperation a@@ f@@ for@@ ded by local initiatives , which Mr H@@ u@@ me made re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to once again , was not just an in@@ no@@ va@@ tive g@@ o@@ al , but was also the right programme to my way of th@@ in@@ king , and I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to be able , once again , to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the fact that it has Parliament &apos; s support .
this programme too was la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed under very difficult conditions in@@ it@@ i@@ ally .
as the Court of Auditors report s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s , it was still able , in the end , to pla@@ y a part in su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation process in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land .
I believe that was the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t of the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise and to that ex@@ t@@ ent , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that it could be j@@ u@@ d@@ ged a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s at the end of the day .
management of European M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te and European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k ( 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 )
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 5 / 2000 ) by Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is , on behalf of the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l , on the report of the Court of Auditors on the op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of the management of the European M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te and the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k for the financial year 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 together with the re@@ p@@ li@@ es of the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 1@@ 9 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 1@@ 6@@ 3 ( C@@ O@@ S ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , I would firstly like to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the work that the Court of Auditors did in pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the report that my report is based on which con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed l@@ o@@ t@@ s of de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed work .
I would also like to thank the services of our committee which h@@ el@@ p@@ ed me a very great deal and indeed the E@@ C@@ B itself which k@@ in@@ d@@ ly en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ed me in F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ur@@ t for a day and t@@ ol@@ d me where my report was going w@@ r@@ on@@ g .
there is a t@@ in@@ y b@@ it of h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y be@@ h@@ in@@ d this report .
on 3@@ 1 M@@ a@@ y 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 the European M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed to the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k .
the p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent was still the same per@@ s@@ on and 4@@ 0@@ 2 of the 4@@ 0@@ 7 st@@ a@@ f@@ f that were working in the E@@ M@@ I ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed also to the E@@ C@@ B .
the E@@ C@@ B to@@ o@@ k on all the as@@ se@@ ts and li@@ ab@@ il@@ ities of the E@@ M@@ I .
the Court of Auditors &apos; report i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied a number of problem areas which I will come to sh@@ or@@ tly .
the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k re@@ p@@ li@@ ed to the report , but its re@@ p@@ li@@ es were certainly sh@@ or@@ t , I would say &apos; ter@@ se &apos; , and the Court of Auditors f@@ ou@@ n@@ d them quite in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate since they did not give any in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations of actions that the E@@ C@@ B in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to take to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y the sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s ex@@ p@@ o@@ sed by the Court of Auditors &apos; report .
there were two main areas where the Court of Auditors i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied problems .
there are e@@ qu@@ ally two areas in which Parliament , and in particular the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l , to@@ o@@ k a great interest .
the Committee was ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the B@@ an@@ k &apos;s re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with O@@ L@@ A@@ F , and this is su@@ m@@ mar@@ ised in my report &apos;s C@@ on@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion 4 which , if will allow me , I will re@@ a@@ d .
this st@@ a@@ tes : &quot; w@@ el@@ comes the public commitment of the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k , in its an@@ n@@ u@@ al report for 1999 , to establish a co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the European A@@ n@@ t@@ i @-@ F@@ ra@@ u@@ d Office O@@ L@@ A@@ F but re@@ g@@ re@@ ts clear in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ bility between the public commitment as@@ su@@ m@@ ed by the E@@ C@@ B in its 1999 an@@ n@@ u@@ al report to establish c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cooperation with O@@ L@@ A@@ F and the decision by the E@@ C@@ B itself to pre@@ v@@ ent O@@ L@@ A@@ F from c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying over internal in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations , pen@@ ding the r@@ ul@@ ing by the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice . &quot;
that is a c@@ ou@@ r@@ t case that is on@@ going .
the other part that the Committee was very in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in was the con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y procedure .
it to@@ o@@ k ag@@ es in this particular case , and when I as@@ k@@ ed both institutions why , they both said that they had re@@ p@@ li@@ ed in the time that they were given and quite within the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es .
so , I can only b@@ la@@ me the p@@ o@@ st@@ al services of F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ur@@ t and L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , and I gu@@ e@@ s@@ s they need greater li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
however , I am sure these problems will not o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in future .
the main areas s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fied as problems in the Court of Auditors &apos; report concerned the E@@ C@@ B &apos;s pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t management and monitoring .
the Court of Auditors &apos; report no@@ ted a lack of any com@@ m@@ it@@ ments ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting system which had c@@ a@@ u@@ sed great concern ; that it was difficult to tra@@ c@@ k pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t development simply and co@@ h@@ er@@ ently ; and that the E@@ C@@ B had en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed a com@@ p@@ an@@ y of con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ ts to r@@ u@@ n some f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency res@@ er@@ ve su@@ b@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ er projects in J@@ u@@ ly 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , but by the end of the year the E@@ C@@ B had still not de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ ted a full @-@ time man@@ ag@@ er for this pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , although that was essential for the monitoring of the con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ ts &apos; work .
it also p@@ o@@ in@@ ted to a number of I@@ T problems .
the other point was ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary b@@ on@@ u@@ se@@ s .
I still find it ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary that the B@@ an@@ k w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e pr@@ im@@ ary objective is pr@@ ice st@@ ability sa@@ w its way to pa@@ ying some st@@ a@@ f@@ f the e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent of a 3@@ 8 % b@@ on@@ us .
the ex@@ c@@ use is that they had wor@@ k@@ ed a l@@ o@@ t in the past - wor@@ k@@ ed a l@@ o@@ t of over@@ time - put a l@@ o@@ t of work in - and that some of these st@@ a@@ f@@ f were being pa@@ i@@ d only 9 % over a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of years and this was al@@ most like c@@ at@@ ch @-@ up pa@@ y .
but that is just s@@ h@@ o@@ d@@ d@@ y management and really should not o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in a B@@ an@@ k like this .
as to my ta@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ s , I was not really sure what I should do .
as s@@ om@@ e@@ one who is not a great f@@ an of the European s@@ in@@ g@@ le c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency and certainly not his country &apos;s en@@ t@@ r@@ y into it , I had a d@@ il@@ em@@ m@@ a with this report .
w@@ h@@ il@@ st I would like to d@@ em@@ and that the E@@ C@@ B take no@@ te of what the Court of Auditors has said , I could have used this report to at@@ ta@@ c@@ k the E@@ C@@ B and g@@ o@@ t great he@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ es for m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f back h@@ om@@ e , but that was not the role of the rapporteur .
so I w@@ ent to the E@@ C@@ B and as@@ k@@ ed for a meeting .
they k@@ in@@ d@@ ly to@@ o@@ k me to F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ur@@ t , and I was t@@ ol@@ d that they had ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed their b@@ on@@ us policy , that they had under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d the problems in pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t management , and so my report is , if not actually n@@ ice , then en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ed by this meeting with the E@@ C@@ B .
at my meeting with the E@@ C@@ B , I was t@@ ol@@ d that it had s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed its problems especially re@@ la@@ ting to the b@@ on@@ us and this would not ha@@ p@@ p@@ en again and it would s@@ en@@ d a le@@ t@@ ter to the Committee de@@ ta@@ il@@ ing its current b@@ on@@ us policy .
as it trans@@ p@@ i@@ res , this le@@ t@@ ter has n@@ e@@ v@@ er t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed up , and that is a great s@@ ha@@ me because the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k should not really fe@@ a@@ r c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m from this in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion .
we are simply doing our j@@ o@@ b .
when problems o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r , and they always will , it should not be the j@@ o@@ b of the E@@ C@@ B to pa@@ per over the c@@ ra@@ c@@ ks and pu@@ l@@ l down the s@@ h@@ u@@ t@@ ters .
it should deal with the problems and te@@ l@@ l the EU and its public how it has de@@ al@@ t with them and not have a p@@ an@@ ic at@@ ta@@ c@@ k over how it com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ a@@ tes these things .
as my s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h has su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed , the report could e@@ a@@ si@@ ly have been a l@@ o@@ t st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er , and the E@@ C@@ B has g@@ o@@ t o@@ f@@ f f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly li@@ g@@ h@@ tly this year .
if si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r or more problems o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r next year , they might find such a report a b@@ it t@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ er , un@@ less they c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e to actually open up , have a dialogue with our Committee , become more trans@@ par@@ ent and t@@ al@@ k to all of us in this Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my point is that the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k is going through a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h p@@ at@@ ch , what with m@@ ou@@ n@@ ting c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m , the f@@ all in the e@@ ur@@ o against the d@@ ol@@ la@@ r , the lack of con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es being is@@ su@@ ed and the un@@ necessary s@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ ing against the B@@ an@@ k , which is a l@@ u@@ x@@ ur@@ y n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the European B@@ an@@ k n@@ or the European system can a@@ f@@ for@@ d .
it is not enough for C@@ a@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ r &apos;s w@@ i@@ f@@ e to be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ ble , she must also ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ ble .
I see the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k as C@@ a@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ r &apos;s w@@ i@@ f@@ e and she is res@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ ble , but she must make more of an e@@ f@@ for@@ t to s@@ how the ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e world that she is res@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ ble .
today , if the t@@ r@@ u@@ th be t@@ ol@@ d , quite a few of our par@@ t@@ n@@ ers are not over@@ ly k@@ e@@ en on the e@@ ur@@ o .
we must t@@ r@@ y not to give others an ex@@ c@@ use to j@@ o@@ in their r@@ an@@ ks ; we must c@@ re@@ ate the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for the e@@ ur@@ o to w@@ in more su@@ p@@ por@@ ters who will then acc@@ ed@@ e to the e@@ ur@@ o z@@ one .
I would also point out , as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the f@@ a@@ m@@ ous b@@ on@@ us which has c@@ a@@ u@@ sed such a st@@ i@@ r , that if there is j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fication for pa@@ ying every em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ e at the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k an an@@ n@@ u@@ al b@@ on@@ us of 9 % of their s@@ al@@ ary , then 3@@ 8 % over a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of 5@@ 4 m@@ on@@ th@@ s comes out at 8@@ .@@ 5 % per an@@ n@@ u@@ m .
so I f@@ a@@ i@@ l to see what there is to c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise about something which is within the b@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of both what is acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble and what has been pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed .
P@@ re@@ su@@ ma@@ b@@ ly the fi@@ gu@@ res have been mis@@ in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted .
however , I would point out that , w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er is done must be done in the best , most trans@@ par@@ ent , most e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er and with the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m possible c@@ re@@ di@@ bility v@@ is @-@ à @-@ v@@ is the ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e world .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the report tabled by the rapporteur , Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is , in committee , and we will support it in this House , for it a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ s both ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation and un@@ d@@ u@@ e res@@ er@@ ve in its com@@ ments on the issues raised by the report of the Court of Auditors on the management of the E@@ M@@ I and the E@@ C@@ B .
the three points raised by Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is are the in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent monitoring of projects , the g@@ r@@ an@@ ting of an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary b@@ on@@ us to E@@ C@@ B em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es and the re@@ f@@ u@@ sa@@ l to be subject to O@@ L@@ A@@ F in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations .
I would not i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that it o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red to any of us that the e@@ ur@@ o would w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ en or that such a th@@ ing would be en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ e@@ red .
that is not the point . the point , in our opinion , is that the greater our rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of the a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity of the m@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y bo@@ di@@ es in question - and I en@@ d@@ or@@ se this rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition , although I also take no@@ te of the clear need for political ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y at European level as well - the greater the need to re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e them to provide clear e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , w@@ age m@@ od@@ er@@ ation and transparency .
there is an ol@@ d sa@@ ying , ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to people w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e actions do not ma@@ t@@ ch their words , which g@@ o@@ es like this : &quot; do what I say , not what I do . &quot;
those w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e role and pre@@ st@@ i@@ ge makes them a point of re@@ f@@ er@@ ence for such a h@@ u@@ ge public and for all the institutions - such as the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k , which has our con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence - cannot per@@ m@@ it themselves even a min@@ or im@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , and still less can they say , &quot; D@@ o what I say , not what I do &quot; while ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ating pr@@ ice st@@ ability , management e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st possible rec@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de and transparency .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because of the major , v@@ al@@ u@@ able role of these institutions - and I wish to st@@ res@@ s this by way of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion - and because the issues con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed can be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed that we are con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent that the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament will be given p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al effect .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will be taken at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
financial assistance to S@@ M@@ E@@ s ( 1999 )
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 5 / 2000 ) by Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws , on behalf of the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs , on the report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council : g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment In@@ it@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve - M@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ res on financial assistance for in@@ no@@ va@@ tive and j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ating S@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ - and M@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m S@@ i@@ z@@ ed E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es ( S@@ M@@ E@@ s ) - A@@ s at 3@@ 1 December 1999 &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ O@@ M ( 2000 ) 2@@ 6@@ 6 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 5@@ 0@@ 7 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 2@@ 4@@ 5 ( C@@ O@@ S ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by just re@@ min@@ ding the House of a few st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s .
there are at least 1@@ 6 million b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses within the EU , 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 % of them are m@@ ic@@ r@@ o to m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed .
there are 1@@ 00 million people working in the EU in the p@@ ri@@ va@@ te sector and , of these , 3@@ 2 million people work in m@@ ic@@ r@@ o @-@ b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , which is b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses of less than 1@@ 0 people ; 3@@ 3 million people work in small to m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , with less than 2@@ 4@@ 9 people .
so a to@@ ta@@ l of 6@@ 5 million workers in the EU are in the small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m sector , which s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that it is very important for us to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of such a sector .
in particular , it is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly right that this specific initiative - g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and employment - should be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed within the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs , although it is clearly also of interest to other com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es .
this particular report is concerned with funding programmes , which was an important initiative from this Parliament a few years ago .
but it is wor@@ th sa@@ ying st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t a@@ way , as con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed at the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , that the issue of the development of S@@ M@@ E@@ s is not just a matter of funding .
it is also very important that all of us se@@ c@@ ur@@ e the right c@@ li@@ ma@@ te for en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , with less red ta@@ p@@ e and less b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y , to encourage S@@ M@@ E@@ s and r@@ is@@ k @-@ ta@@ k@@ ers to actually consider taking out r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al in the first place .
1999 was the first full year of this particular set of initiatives and , therefore , as a start @-@ up p@@ ha@@ se it should have been re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ forward to report upon this without being too con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al .
however , there are some con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al el@@ em@@ ents in the report , e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally because of the Commission ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble in is@@ su@@ ing its report .
I have an@@ n@@ e@@ x@@ ed the de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble to the report .
it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as the in@@ it@@ i@@ al d@@ ra@@ f@@ t proposal from the Commission c@@ a@@ me out in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er / December 1999 , it l@@ it@@ er@@ ally to@@ o@@ k a full fi@@ ve m@@ on@@ th@@ s before the report c@@ a@@ me before Parliament .
then there was a further d@@ el@@ a@@ y within Parliament , because we are not per@@ f@@ ec@@ t in that respect either .
it to@@ o@@ k over a m@@ on@@ th to al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ate it to a rapporteur and then , because of the su@@ m@@ m@@ er rec@@ e@@ s@@ s , it was not possible to programme the internal debate and discussion until O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er .
despite this long d@@ el@@ a@@ y , there was further in@@ com@@ p@@ et@@ ence , d@@ are I say , within the S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ ri@@ at because the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y under Mrs F@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ ch as the rapporteur had pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed some very u@@ se@@ ful amendments to the report which only c@@ a@@ me to the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment after we had voted on the report .
so that again was not ex@@ ac@@ tly im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve .
I have agreed with Mrs F@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ ch that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through un@@ ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ ed , as there are a number of u@@ se@@ ful con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions there .
I should ad@@ d that I as@@ k@@ ed the Commission back in A@@ u@@ gu@@ st about a particular com@@ ment in the report , which st@@ a@@ ted that in A@@ u@@ gu@@ st there would be some fe@@ ed@@ back from S@@ M@@ E@@ s about their res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
however , the Commission did not re@@ p@@ ly .
I as@@ k@@ ed again in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er where this information was and it finally re@@ p@@ li@@ ed : &quot; what information are you w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for ?
we do not understand ! &quot;
it was l@@ it@@ er@@ ally only y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day that I received an e @-@ ma@@ i@@ l from the Commission st@@ ating that there was such information but it had been s@@ ent to the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s rather than to our committee - again , not too im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve .
y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , I s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e in the debate on the D@@ o@@ or@@ n report on S@@ L@@ I@@ M concerning b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y .
I should like to re@@ in@@ for@@ ce those com@@ ments now , because the fact that this report had to go through so many different D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ a@@ tes before it em@@ er@@ ged - including legal , b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s , financial control , general se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ ri@@ at , regional , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion , employment and social a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s , re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , internal market and com@@ p@@ et@@ ition - is not an im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve way of de@@ al@@ ing with an important subject .
I speak not only on behalf of this report but also , I am sure , of other reports that need to go through the same system .
this is just too much m@@ ic@@ r@@ om@@ an@@ ag@@ ement .
there are too many man@@ ag@@ ers involved and , as a result , the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t en@@ ds up not being fully man@@ ag@@ ed .
finally , I have made a few com@@ ments about the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k taking a con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ing interest in the E@@ I@@ F .
this may be ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly right given its ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise , but we want to ensure that these particular projects are given the priority they d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve .
I am not particularly con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent but we shall w@@ at@@ ch to see how that g@@ o@@ es .
I have also called for a full a@@ u@@ d@@ it , not because of any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t about the financial pro@@ b@@ ity , but just as a b@@ a@@ si@@ c management control system .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , may I say that the Commission has ap@@ par@@ ently already w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t report for the year 2000 .
I should like to ask that we see it now so that we can make a positive contribution now in good time , rather than re@@ p@@ e@@ at the ti@@ m@@ ing of the current report .
here we are in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 2001 de@@ b@@ ating and v@@ o@@ ting on a report that was is@@ su@@ ed back in 1999 .
it is already h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y .
on such an important subject we want to deal with the present , th@@ e@@ re@@ by being better able to s@@ ha@@ p@@ e the future .
Mr President , I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur and to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that there is b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally no di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the att@@ it@@ u@@ d@@ es of the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs and the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y .
we therefore en@@ d@@ or@@ se the rapporteur &apos; s con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , particularly his com@@ ments on d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s , which should be a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ed in future .
the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y perhaps em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed to a greater ex@@ t@@ ent the importance of S@@ M@@ E@@ s for employment , the need to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate access to r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al , the need to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures and regarding im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between the various Commission programmes of interest to small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
we therefore tabled a number of amendments and , as the rapporteur has just ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed , due to an un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , the rapporteur did not rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the amendments in time .
I should like to thank h@@ i@@ m , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , for having t@@ ri@@ ed to accept A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 1 to 8 , which con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te the b@@ ul@@ k of the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y &apos; s amendments , which com@@ pl@@ ement the rapporteur &apos; s report .
Mr President , the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it was ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised by w@@ e@@ a@@ k decisions .
however , it will not im@@ p@@ ed@@ e progress towards an ever st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er European Union .
when national measures have no effect , that is when Europe comes into pla@@ y .
we are ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing this with B@@ S@@ E .
su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly , all si@@ d@@ es are c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for effective c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order con@@ su@@ m@@ er protection and ro@@ b@@ u@@ st action where w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly la@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ed products are concerned .
we are also ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing this with the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against un@@ employment .
the S@@ M@@ E@@ s feel the e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of uni@@ on @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e initiatives for g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and employment , which are de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to under@@ p@@ in the measures in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by the Member States .
one of the first things to come out of this programme is that EUR 4@@ 5@@ 0 million is to be made available for g@@ ro@@ w@@ th @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ ted S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group , I would like to congratulate P@@ h@@ il@@ i@@ p B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws on his report , which be@@ ar@@ s w@@ it@@ ness to his ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ ally de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
we con@@ c@@ u@@ r with his c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of the Commission for pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing too little information too late .
just how are we su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to over@@ see matters pro@@ per@@ ly , or even su@@ b@@ m@@ it s@@ ol@@ i@@ d programme proposals under such en@@ or@@ m@@ ous p@@ res@@ sure of time ?
we need c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication on which of the three f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities - start @-@ up c@@ ap@@ it@@ al , gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es , or j@@ o@@ in@@ t v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ res - have ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed the best results , in which States and which se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s com@@ p@@ an@@ ies were set up , whether the small en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es had access to f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n c@@ ap@@ it@@ al too , or whether st@@ a@@ te@@ ments or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ating from S@@ M@@ E c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ l@@ es are cor@@ rec@@ t , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to which , more than 5@@ 0 000 new j@@ o@@ b@@ s were c@@ re@@ ated simply by means of interest su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es to the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of EUR 1@@ 00 million , which age groups are especially re@@ qu@@ i@@ red , and to what ex@@ t@@ ent women were involved .
in t@@ al@@ king to S@@ M@@ E@@ s in my con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ency , I con@@ st@@ an@@ tly m@@ e@@ t with com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts that the funds are v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ ally only ever g@@ r@@ an@@ ted to en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ ar@@ t te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
other in@@ no@@ va@@ tive en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , from the c@@ ra@@ f@@ t industry for example , ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to qu@@ al@@ i@@ fy , too , to my mind .
we must also take greater account of the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability of services .
Mr President , let us se@@ i@@ z@@ e on the initiative em@@ an@@ ating from Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws &apos; excellent report .
the more de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed the information , the s@@ o@@ on@@ er con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in EU initiatives will g@@ ro@@ w .
Mr President , on behalf of the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group , I very much support this report and in particular the initiatives be@@ h@@ in@@ d the E@@ T@@ F S@@ ta@@ r@@ t @-@ up F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity and the S@@ m@@ all and M@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ S@@ i@@ z@@ ed E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise G@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
I am sure there is a s@@ ha@@ red opinion ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s this House of how important small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses are .
in my own country , the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m , the small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s population has actually in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d in si@@ z@@ e by one h@@ al@@ f since 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 and there is now one small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s for every 1@@ 3 ad@@ ul@@ ts in the population .
small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses are important not just for j@@ o@@ b@@ s but also for trade in this European Union .
I rec@@ all t@@ al@@ king with the c@@ ou@@ n@@ s@@ el@@ l@@ or in the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y de@@ al@@ ing with B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and the B@@ en@@ el@@ u@@ x countries and ex@@ por@@ ts into those countries , who t@@ ol@@ d me that the va@@ st ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , over 9@@ 0 % of the en@@ qu@@ i@@ ri@@ es which he de@@ als with , are not from large com@@ p@@ an@@ ies se@@ e@@ king to ex@@ por@@ t but from small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
so that is very re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to us in this House too .
it is re@@ le@@ v@@ ant because of the L@@ is@@ b@@ on process .
we w@@ el@@ com@@ ed the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons from the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it last year : the mo@@ ve towards f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility , the mo@@ ve towards ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ sh@@ i@@ p , towards in@@ no@@ va@@ tion that were re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted there .
these f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities should be seen very much as being at the he@@ ar@@ t of t@@ r@@ ying to achieve those economic g@@ o@@ als .
I would also like to change past practice by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws .
I have s@@ at in the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs with h@@ i@@ m for the last year or so and I have he@@ ar@@ d h@@ i@@ m make the same s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h time after time about de @-@ regulation and too much b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y at European level .
he has actually come up with something con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive here , so well done Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws .
Nice to see that you can do some work , or at least others can do it on your behalf .
I particularly congratulate you on your con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons regarding the need for more transparency and s@@ p@@ e@@ ed - ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te support for that - and on the importance of the high te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s - y@@ es , but not just those .
also , I am very sur@@ pr@@ ised to see you pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the need to increase f@@ em@@ al@@ e participation in small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions to you for su@@ p@@ por@@ ting that .
I would have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to see more on the social ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
our co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses should be seen f@@ a@@ i@@ r and s@@ qu@@ are as part of the small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s sector .
they are particularly important in terms of j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ation a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged groups in the la@@ b@@ our market .
they are particularly important in terms of s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ally u@@ se@@ ful employment and it is an om@@ is@@ sion that they are mis@@ sing from the report .
they should not be t@@ re@@ ated di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ently ; they should be given ex@@ t@@ r@@ a help .
perhaps the Commission could com@@ ment on that at the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e of the debate .
I would also like to particularly support A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 3 from the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group .
we will be su@@ p@@ por@@ ting all of the amendments to the effect that b@@ an@@ k gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al are still far too st@@ r@@ ic@@ t , far too con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive and actually pre@@ v@@ ent ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s from c@@ re@@ ating j@@ o@@ b@@ s in the U@@ K and in other European countries .
let me con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de by sa@@ ying that y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day the U@@ K Government pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed T@@ h@@ in@@ k small first , a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment about en@@ sur@@ ing that every de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of government th@@ in@@ ks about small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , not just about the a@@ va@@ il@@ ability of fin@@ ance that we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing in this debate but about the over@@ all ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic framework and the s@@ or@@ ts of ad@@ v@@ ice and s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s that they need to support them and become pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous .
we in this European Union should follow that le@@ a@@ d and ensure that every D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al , every s@@ er@@ v@@ ice of the European Union pu@@ ts small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses first .
Mr President , I want first of all to congratulate Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws on his report .
he has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a good p@@ i@@ ec@@ e of work in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of difficult conditions , and we in the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party very much agree with his con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , as well as with the amendments tabled by the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y .
there are , of course , many different w@@ a@@ y@@ s to c@@ re@@ ate full employment , but this cannot be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed without economic progress and a high de@@ g@@ re@@ e of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
this was also , of course , the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed by the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it last year which s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and development as the means to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er employment in the EU .
mo@@ re@@ over , every p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an has a s@@ o@@ f@@ t s@@ p@@ o@@ t for small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
at any ra@@ te , that is t@@ r@@ u@@ e w@@ h@@ en@@ ever we ra@@ ise our g@@ la@@ s@@ ses in p@@ ra@@ ise of their importance to economic development and employment .
when it comes to e@@ ver@@ y@@ d@@ a@@ y practice , however , the re@@ al@@ ity is all too often different .
far too many ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es are pla@@ c@@ ed in the way in the form of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c rules which de@@ ter many people from se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up in b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s .
there are not enough in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es to take r@@ is@@ ks , and this g@@ en@@ er@@ ally im@@ p@@ ed@@ es development and d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ mis@@ m .
we cannot , of course , get a@@ way from the fact that , in general , there is less w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to take r@@ is@@ ks in the EU than in the United States , something which is re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted in less d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c new b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s development .
I therefore also think it is important to ensure that these programmes which , through the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k , provide small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es with new fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing opportunities op@@ er@@ ate as e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently as possible in the e@@ y@@ es of the en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es concerned .
the programmes must be made more w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y k@@ no@@ w@@ n and l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to other programmes , and it must of course be en@@ su@@ red that the pa@@ y@@ ments are not d@@ ra@@ g@@ g@@ ed out , indeed that the programmes op@@ er@@ ate with a min@@ im@@ u@@ m of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y .
Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws &apos; s excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y con@@ ta@@ in c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence to d@@ ate .
that c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m should be taken on bo@@ ar@@ d so that our f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly fe@@ el@@ in@@ g@@ s for small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es do not only find ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion in fin@@ e c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es , but also in practice .
we must also ensure that the programmes are effective over@@ all , and I am therefore particularly p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d about Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws &apos; s request that the Commission follow up the programmes and ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine their effect on employment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing what excellent reports are pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed , although the Commission basis is com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate .
the rapporteur pu@@ ts forward the proposal that en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es that have not taken up support programmes should be in@@ ter@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed .
I con@@ su@@ l@@ ted n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es on this , in my c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity as o@@ w@@ n@@ er of a m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
the al@@ most un@@ an@@ im@@ ous ver@@ d@@ ic@@ t was as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws : when it comes to the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment F@@ un@@ d , and especially the various com@@ p@@ on@@ ents of the A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al A@@ c@@ tion P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me ( A@@ S@@ A@@ P ) on S@@ M@@ E@@ s and j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ation , we small en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es l@@ o@@ s@@ e tra@@ c@@ k of things because there is a p@@ le@@ th@@ or@@ a of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al su@@ b @-@ programmes , responsibility for which is in all k@@ in@@ ds of different h@@ an@@ ds , I might ad@@ d .
for example , there is the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l S@@ M@@ E guarantee f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity , the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and employment initiative , the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and environmental initiative , the E@@ I@@ F te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity E@@ T@@ F , the E@@ T@@ F start @-@ up @-@ programme , new su@@ b @-@ programmes for in@@ no@@ va@@ tion at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to E@@ I@@ F @-@ E@@ T@@ F since L@@ is@@ b@@ on , e @-@ Europe , e @-@ L@@ e@@ ar@@ n@@ ing et@@ c .
how are these d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ed from one another and where must I , as ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r , su@@ b@@ m@@ it the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations for my pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t i@@ d@@ e@@ as ?
Parliament has the same problem from the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive , if it w@@ an@@ ts to as@@ se@@ s@@ s how the A@@ S@@ A@@ P is de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing over@@ all , because the reports from the E@@ I@@ B and E@@ I@@ F do not con@@ ta@@ in a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent account .
s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es there is t@@ al@@ k , in general terms , of the full r@@ an@@ ge of S@@ M@@ E support , and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al com@@ p@@ on@@ ents of the A@@ S@@ A@@ P are c@@ ited in different con@@ te@@ x@@ ts .
there are also a few things w@@ r@@ on@@ g with the organisation of the A@@ S@@ A@@ P on the policy si@@ d@@ e .
the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and environmental initiative has not received any more funds .
what is more , it st@@ ri@@ v@@ es for a com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated after @-@ c@@ are st@@ y@@ le of environmental protection .
the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing areas , i@@ .@@ e@@ . g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and employment , E@@ T@@ F , et@@ c@@ . have received con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ous bo@@ o@@ st@@ s , I g@@ r@@ an@@ t you , but they con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on a few high @-@ te@@ ch se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s al@@ one , pre@@ d@@ om@@ in@@ an@@ tly in@@ no@@ va@@ tion , com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ations and g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing .
in many cases , these S@@ M@@ E@@ s are not de@@ al@@ t with di@@ rec@@ tly ; in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation procedure is h@@ an@@ d@@ led by m@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ l@@ em@@ en , u@@ su@@ ally tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment funds , which rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the c@@ re@@ d@@ its and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es from the E@@ I@@ B , and which the S@@ M@@ E@@ s have to go to with any com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts .
that being the case , in fact no@@ b@@ od@@ y but the E@@ I@@ B k@@ no@@ ws which S@@ M@@ E@@ s are rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing support for p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y which projects , and how many j@@ o@@ b@@ s are being c@@ re@@ ated in the process .
that is why h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to , when as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the effect these programmes have on employment , rather than pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing con@@ c@@ re@@ te fi@@ gu@@ res , the E@@ I@@ B has per@@ for@@ m@@ ed a si@@ m@@ p@@ le ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic mo@@ de@@ l e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ te .
more de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed information will be available on the ou@@ t@@ come of the whole ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise in 5 to 1@@ 0 years &apos; time .
R@@ u@@ m@@ our has it that e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally , the A@@ S@@ A@@ P s@@ er@@ v@@ es to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the European r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al market for information and com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation , g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing and st@@ ar@@ ting up new b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , and that the j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ation as@@ p@@ ec@@ t is not actually ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed in greater de@@ ta@@ i@@ l or as@@ se@@ s@@ sed .
the E@@ I@@ B h@@ om@@ e@@ pa@@ ge s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing the l@@ is@@ t of funds to which the E@@ I@@ B has given c@@ re@@ d@@ its and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es , f@@ u@@ el@@ s this no@@ tion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is one of those su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts on which we cannot and , in fact , do not have any d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts or h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ ations as to our political approach .
first of all , programmes a@@ im@@ ed at pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing employment and g@@ ro@@ w@@ th are still v@@ it@@ ally important , despite some positive si@@ g@@ n@@ s in recent years .
secondly , the st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c importance of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es in this area is quite clear and c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , as was st@@ a@@ ted in the defin@@ ition of the initiative for greater employment , which was st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed rec@@ ently by the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es la@@ i@@ d down at the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it .
I too , like the rapporteur , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I congratulate , wish to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the L@@ is@@ b@@ on S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion that c@@ al@@ l@@ s for a c@@ li@@ ma@@ te en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , and in particular a re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y framework which is con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ ve to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we are all fully aware of the particularly t@@ ou@@ g@@ h ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es as well as the new opportunities that economic g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation p@@ res@@ ents for small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly , it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for the European Union and the Member States to over@@ come the re@@ la@@ tive g@@ a@@ p that ex@@ is@@ t@@ s in many areas between the EU and the United States .
if we are to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l our res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in this area , we must have good information in good time .
this has , until now , not been the case .
I agree with the rapporteur &apos; s c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s and I also call for the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t 2000 report to be su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to us in time , by M@@ ar@@ ch of this year , o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise the h@@ ar@@ s@@ h c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m that we have re@@ f@@ ra@@ in@@ ed from making this year will have to be made with even greater se@@ ver@@ ity next year .
in its re@@ por@@ ting procedures , the Commission must ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the priority and the importance that we at@@ ta@@ ch to these areas and ensure that these are re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted in the quality of its an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s to@@ ol@@ s .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I think that we must improve our commitment : I agree with the rapporteur when he ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ tes that our interest in high te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y and k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es must not mean that we for@@ get the more tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses involved in t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , trade , c@@ ra@@ f@@ ts and in services in general .
we must consider the amendments , since we need to d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te a greater ability to h@@ ar@@ ness v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al . the amendments also , in my opinion , com@@ pl@@ ement the report well .
Mr President , Europe n@@ or@@ m@@ ally fin@@ ds it h@@ ar@@ d to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the impact of government policy . that is not the case in this report .
I therefore find the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment p@@ res@@ en@@ ted here of the effects of the programme on ac@@ t@@ u@@ al j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ation particularly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , since the agreement of the Council for E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y on 20 December 2000 regarding the c@@ re@@ ation of ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es of as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation for the European com@@ p@@ an@@ y , the legal and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for S@@ M@@ E@@ s are l@@ o@@ o@@ king up .
this is essential , since S@@ M@@ E@@ s form 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 8 % of all f@@ ir@@ m@@ s and em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y 6@@ 6 % of the European wor@@ k@@ force .
yet the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of an S@@ M@@ E con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to apply to a c@@ at@@ ch @-@ all c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y em@@ b@@ ra@@ c@@ ing a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of com@@ p@@ an@@ y st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
the great ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of them are f@@ ir@@ m@@ s em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ying at most 1@@ 0 em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es .
it is to be re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ted that their special ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s have not been rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised and that they do not b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from special measures .
un@@ like the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y , which m@@ en@@ tions it in its opinion , the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs does not m@@ en@@ tion any such rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , the aid programme should not be res@@ er@@ v@@ ed for the large S@@ M@@ E@@ s using or pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing le@@ ad@@ ing ed@@ ge te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al sector should also be able to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it in full .
I am th@@ in@@ king in particular of the c@@ ra@@ f@@ t sector , which pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es employment , know @-@ how and in@@ no@@ va@@ tion .
from this point of view , I support the programme of start @-@ up f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities for s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
on the other hand , I am more sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ al of the idea of ur@@ g@@ ing Member States to a@@ m@@ en@@ d their tax la@@ ws .
there are pl@@ ans to c@@ re@@ ate a s@@ in@@ g@@ le European st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture for r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment funds op@@ er@@ ating in par@@ al@@ le@@ l with national st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
this is li@@ able to make ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures more com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated for the small S@@ M@@ E@@ s who do not n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y have the resources to deal with them .
Mr President , I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to be s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king on this major d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment tabled by Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I have the h@@ on@@ our to call my f@@ ri@@ end .
I am g@@ la@@ d to see that this report , which is so important for the development of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses in Europe , has been so well w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en , and I hope that Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws will continue to be a be@@ ac@@ on of li@@ g@@ h@@ t for all those d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up European Union le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive measures on small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
he is certainly one of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st authorities on the matter , which b@@ ec@@ a@@ me extremely important after the f@@ all of com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ m .
as we are all aware , com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ m and the countries of the E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n B@@ l@@ o@@ c st@@ i@@ f@@ led free initiative . there were no small ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s in com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t st@@ a@@ tes .
we have now pro@@ v@@ ed the su@@ per@@ i@@ or@@ ity of the economic system of free initiative .
I therefore ur@@ ge Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er in future - and Commissioner S@@ ch@@ re@@ y@@ er to be@@ a@@ r in mind both now and in future - that , in addition to the major initiatives proposed in this report , it would be appropriate to call st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly upon the Member States to ex@@ em@@ p@@ t small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses which are just st@@ ar@@ ting o@@ f@@ f from ta@@ x@@ es for at least the first fi@@ ve years of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
w@@ h@@ o@@ ever un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ es a free initiative c@@ re@@ a@@ tes at least one j@@ o@@ b - his own - and often em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ s family members and other people as well .
I am sure that this proposal will be m@@ u@@ si@@ c to Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws &apos; e@@ ar@@ s , for he is well @-@ k@@ no@@ w@@ n for being op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to ta@@ x@@ ation , and I therefore hope that both he and Commissioner S@@ ch@@ re@@ y@@ er will accept it .
Mr President , I would like to start by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws on this major report .
I also have to say that I am extremely gra@@ te@@ ful to h@@ i@@ m for having acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted the amendments I proposed which su@@ p@@ pl@@ ement the main part of the report on certain points and certain b@@ a@@ si@@ c issues .
in my opinion , it is extremely important to be f@@ o@@ c@@ using on the development of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses and what that in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es , in order to o@@ f@@ f@@ set the un@@ employment in large b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se .
Europe must , therefore , make it a priority to support b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , c@@ re@@ ate a f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble c@@ li@@ ma@@ te for their e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment and development , encourage re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and , above all , encourage the le@@ ad@@ ing se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
it is also of pr@@ im@@ ary importance that the European Parliament su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ s in monitoring both the projects and the results made possible by European funding .
this would ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be of ex@@ t@@ re@@ me importance , together with the fact that small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses in the small c@@ ra@@ f@@ t , trade and t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s - as I p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out - and other services will also b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it .
we must take on bo@@ ar@@ d the fact that the er@@ a when people st@@ a@@ y@@ ed in the same j@@ o@@ b all their li@@ v@@ es has pa@@ s@@ sed , that we must change our per@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of employment and that the sector of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed industry and c@@ ra@@ f@@ t tra@@ d@@ es will provide in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c j@@ o@@ b opportunities for our young people and for the future European citizens .
it is v@@ it@@ al for Europe to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s and we must continue to have con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in this approach .
Mr President , I would like to thank my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e , Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws , for the great ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise he has d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted in d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting this report .
although S@@ M@@ E@@ s now em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y two @-@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the wor@@ k@@ force in the whole of the European Union , there is still employment p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al in the S@@ M@@ E sector .
support and v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al while a com@@ p@@ an@@ y is being set up are en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s@@ ly important for the c@@ re@@ ation of j@@ o@@ b@@ s , as , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to certain st@@ u@@ di@@ es , S@@ M@@ E@@ s use as much as 8@@ 0 % to 9@@ 0 % of v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al market resources in taking on st@@ a@@ f@@ f .
we must give S@@ M@@ E@@ s that have p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for g@@ ro@@ w@@ th our st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ est support , ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of what sector they op@@ er@@ ate in .
more attention must also be pa@@ i@@ d to making it e@@ a@@ si@@ er for com@@ p@@ an@@ ies to g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ ise , so that S@@ M@@ E@@ s may take full ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t by the internal market .
also great in this regard are the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing systems of gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es and le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive reform regarding m@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ ag@@ es , which we are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ting in the Committee on E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y Affairs .
I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Commission should , in future , provide information more pr@@ om@@ p@@ tly on how this important initiative is pro@@ g@@ res@@ sing .
in future , the Commission &apos; s reports should con@@ ta@@ in fe@@ ed@@ back on the u@@ s@@ ers of the f@@ un@@ d so that de@@ f@@ ec@@ ts in the system can be s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ il@@ y rec@@ ti@@ fied .
finally , I would like to f@@ o@@ c@@ us attention on those legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons which a@@ i@@ m to make it e@@ a@@ si@@ er for b@@ an@@ k@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t com@@ p@@ an@@ ies to be@@ g@@ in tra@@ ding again .
although these com@@ p@@ an@@ ies have pro@@ v@@ ed to be a r@@ is@@ k once , that does not mean that the same th@@ ing will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en in the future .
b@@ an@@ k@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t com@@ p@@ an@@ ies should rather be v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed as a res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce for Europe , which we should not f@@ a@@ i@@ l to ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it .
I would also like to st@@ res@@ s how important small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses are for com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s with regard to Europe &apos; s b@@ i@@ g com@@ p@@ an@@ ies .
small com@@ p@@ an@@ ies often work as su@@ b@@ con@@ tra@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s for our European ma@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ h organisations , and , as a result , the position of small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses is more important than ever for com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s throughout Europe .
Mr President , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that this report has been put before the House .
especially with my being an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r , I would like to congratulate the Commission on having b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t out , to excellent effect , what is la@@ c@@ king in Europe .
what it bo@@ il@@ s down to is that there is not enough start @-@ up c@@ ap@@ it@@ al available for people who want to set up in b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , and so n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s have to give up again pre@@ ma@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ ly .
ex@@ por@@ ts con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te a r@@ is@@ k of course , and so it is particularly important for j@@ o@@ in@@ t v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ res to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve financial support in the e@@ ar@@ ly st@@ ag@@ es , more than at any other time .
the guarantee system s@@ er@@ v@@ es to ensure that not everyone who is w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to become an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ es his li@@ v@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ d in the process and f@@ ac@@ es the r@@ is@@ k of financial r@@ u@@ in , at the very least , for the re@@ st of his life .
when we consider that ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 7 b@@ il@@ li@@ on is available in r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al in Europe , w@@ h@@ il@@ st in A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e st@@ an@@ ds at EUR 1@@ 2 b@@ il@@ li@@ on , then we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to give th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to how we can make good the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
what st@@ e@@ p@@ s can we take , particularly as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture ?
the very wor@@ d B@@ S@@ E ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to in@@ s@@ p@@ ir@@ e us to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t on what kind of young en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es we could establish in order better to guarantee food safety , c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d te@@ st@@ s , de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p t@@ re@@ at@@ ments and so on .
ur@@ g@@ ent action is called for here .
I would also like to st@@ res@@ s that it is important for young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s to be given a commitment they can re@@ ly on as s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ il@@ y as possible .
de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ es should be set by which a decision must be given in the form of a clear &apos; y@@ es &apos; or &apos; no &apos; , so as to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d any un@@ necessary r@@ is@@ k .
it is also important to apply the directive on ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing de@@ f@@ a@@ ul@@ t in pa@@ y@@ ment , so that people actually get their h@@ an@@ ds on the money within a set per@@ i@@ o@@ d of time .
there is still too much h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ an@@ c@@ y on this sc@@ or@@ e for my l@@ i@@ k@@ ing .
the Commission should su@@ b@@ m@@ it proposals on pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t management , de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p best practice m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s , in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks , on the basis of which it will be possible to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine how much time el@@ ap@@ ses between the first ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation and the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful c@@ re@@ ation of j@@ o@@ b@@ s . it also needs to m@@ on@@ it@@ or pa@@ y@@ ment f@@ l@@ o@@ ws , and finally , promote the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e strategy in the public ar@@ en@@ a .
when it comes to P@@ R , one idea would be to have a &apos; young ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r of the year &apos; p@@ ri@@ z@@ e , a@@ w@@ ar@@ ded to the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r who has c@@ re@@ ated the most j@@ o@@ b@@ s in ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te terms and in per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge fi@@ gu@@ res .
this would d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te at European level , and cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly in the Member States , that we are going the right way about this .
Mr President , as I am here in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e P@@ ed@@ r@@ o S@@ ol@@ b@@ es M@@ ir@@ a , I will give his s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h in E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h , also in h@@ on@@ our of the rapporteur .
this report concerns the first an@@ n@@ u@@ al report on the G@@ ro@@ w@@ th and E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment In@@ it@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve .
this initiative a@@ im@@ s to provide financial assistance for in@@ no@@ va@@ tive and j@@ o@@ b @-@ c@@ re@@ ating small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es as a st@@ e@@ p towards the development of a b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s c@@ li@@ ma@@ te con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ ve to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion and ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
it is also in line with the L@@ is@@ b@@ on European Council con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of M@@ ar@@ ch 2000 where the objectives of st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing employment , economic reform and social cohesion as part of a k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ based ec@@ on@@ om@@ y were set as a new st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c g@@ o@@ al for the Union .
I would like to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the main points raised by the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs &apos; report pre@@ pa@@ red by Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws .
firstly , the report no@@ tes that the Commission re@@ por@@ ting process is too l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y , c@@ a@@ using d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in the rec@@ e@@ i@@ p@@ t of the report by Parliament .
at the same time , Parliament &apos;s report st@@ a@@ tes that there is a lack of information particularly concerning fe@@ ed@@ back information from small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies of the G@@ ro@@ w@@ th and E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment In@@ it@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve .
in my view , these two matters are in@@ ter @-@ l@@ in@@ k@@ ed and are a result of the way the financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments that form part of the G@@ ro@@ w@@ th and E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment In@@ it@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve are con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ted .
these are de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed so as to com@@ m@@ it b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y resources to financial institutions such as v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al funds , national guarantee s@@ ch@@ em@@ es and com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al b@@ an@@ ks which would ac@@ t as in@@ ter@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ar@@ ies for fin@@ al S@@ M@@ E b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies .
in this respect , the information regarding commitment and draw @-@ d@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ s made to financial institutions in a given year is available during the first qu@@ ar@@ ter of the following year .
on the other hand , fe@@ ed@@ back information from small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es concerning a given year is only available for all the in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments in the last qu@@ ar@@ ter of the following year .
this im@@ p@@ li@@ es that an an@@ n@@ u@@ al report d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up by the end of A@@ p@@ ri@@ l will in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de year @-@ end st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s for the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous year at the financial in@@ ter@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ary level and at the S@@ M@@ E level , de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s for the p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ing year .
these time @-@ sc@@ al@@ es in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate why last year &apos;s an@@ n@@ u@@ al report re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to 1999 , which was the first full year of the programme , could not in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed information at S@@ M@@ E level .
this le@@ ad@@ s us to the following point : st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing the initiative is an objective s@@ ha@@ red by both Parliament and the Commission .
however , a r@@ e @-@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ ing of the financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments of the initiative cannot be done an@@ n@@ u@@ ally .
first of all , market pla@@ y@@ ers could be con@@ f@@ u@@ sed and find it difficult to ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the reasons for these ch@@ an@@ g@@ es .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed evaluation of these in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments based on a bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m @-@ up approach is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
regarding the J@@ E@@ F@@ V programme which has had the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ t take @-@ up out of the three financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments of the G@@ ro@@ w@@ th and E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment In@@ it@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve , the m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al programme for en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es f@@ o@@ re@@ se@@ es a si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e to en@@ able S@@ M@@ E@@ s &apos; re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for financial con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to be de@@ al@@ t with more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly by the financial in@@ ter@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ar@@ ies and the Commission services .
the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of ad@@ op@@ ting the el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ bility c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a will also be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed in order to res@@ p@@ on@@ d more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y to the needs of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
concerning the reform of the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment F@@ un@@ d , the report is in@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ t in st@@ ating that the Commission can no longer use the E@@ I@@ F di@@ rec@@ tly as a to@@ o@@ l for fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
as before , current and the future Community s@@ ch@@ em@@ es en@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ ed to the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment F@@ un@@ d will be man@@ ag@@ ed se@@ par@@ a@@ te@@ ly from its own resources under the principle set and con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed by the Commission services .
finally , the report qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons the tax st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of v@@ en@@ ture c@@ ap@@ it@@ al funds and c@@ al@@ l@@ s on the Commission to encourage each Member State to adopt la@@ ws per@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ing tax @-@ trans@@ par@@ ent funds to be c@@ re@@ ated in their country and to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise trans@@ par@@ ent funds e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r way in other Member States .
this matter , which is of great interest to the Commission , has rec@@ ently been de@@ al@@ t with in the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the r@@ is@@ k c@@ ap@@ it@@ al action plan which was fin@@ al@@ is@@ ed in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2000 .
to qu@@ o@@ t@@ e from the report &quot; the tax st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture might h@@ in@@ d@@ er c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment by c@@ re@@ ating specific tax ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es or even dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ating against f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ or@@ s .
a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve res@@ p@@ on@@ se to such b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers might be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed most e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y through co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated action on EU level .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , Member States have to make sure that tax t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es and all other tax law in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments pre@@ v@@ ent d@@ ou@@ ble @-@ ta@@ x@@ ation of di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ en@@ ds in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment &apos; .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , now that the re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing of the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment F@@ un@@ d is com@@ p@@ le@@ te , the Commission services and the E@@ I@@ F are working together to pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y implement the E@@ C@@ O@@ F@@ I@@ N and In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y Council &apos;s decisions , in particular with the m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al programme for en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
to be re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c , Parliament should not ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t any su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al result before 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 or 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 , although pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations in particular from guarantee s@@ ch@@ em@@ es might be available e@@ ar@@ li@@ er .
let me ad@@ d as the B@@ u@@ d@@ get Commissioner , that the Commission has w@@ el@@ com@@ ed Parliament &apos;s decision for the 2001 b@@ u@@ d@@ get to increase a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for l@@ o@@ ans and g@@ r@@ an@@ ts available to S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
this was an important si@@ g@@ n@@ al to the small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es and an important st@@ e@@ p to achieve the a@@ im@@ s of L@@ is@@ b@@ on to c@@ re@@ ate a k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ based m@@ od@@ er@@ n ec@@ on@@ om@@ y in the European Union .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will be taken at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
frontier workers
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 8 / 2000 ) by Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en , on behalf of the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs , on the situation of frontier workers &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 2000 / 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 0 ( I@@ N@@ I ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , it c@@ a@@ me as a sur@@ pr@@ ise to me as well that this debate was being s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ed in today .
the to@@ p@@ i@@ c of frontier work has f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated me for over 2@@ 1 years , the l@@ en@@ g@@ th of time I have s@@ er@@ v@@ ed in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , in the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch L@@ o@@ w@@ er C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , but also in the European Parliament .
it f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ a@@ tes me not only because I am f@@ ac@@ ed d@@ a@@ il@@ y with problems which frontier workers ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence when they li@@ ve in one Member State and work in another , but also because the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ ic@@ s be@@ h@@ in@@ d it are quite con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able , m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ ic@@ s which have to be ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ed an@@ n@@ u@@ ally .
it also f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ a@@ tes me because it d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes that par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments that is , are not g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing things mo@@ v@@ ing qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly enough .
another reason why it f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ a@@ tes me is that what p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r un@@ able to s@@ or@@ t out , the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice man@@ ag@@ es to se@@ t@@ t@@ le , and Member States are always being le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red about pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing right any ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing mis@@ ta@@ k@@ es .
this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to a re@@ mar@@ k which I would like to make v@@ is @-@ à @-@ v@@ is the European Commission .
I have no a@@ x@@ e to g@@ r@@ in@@ d with the European Commission .
it is particularly the Council , the members of the Council , who are un@@ w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to g@@ r@@ an@@ t frontier work the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility it needs , and so we p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans , national p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans that is , le@@ a@@ ve this for the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice to s@@ ol@@ ve .
I think this is no longer acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble , or necessary , for that matter , and that we must make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t , and em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y all means , in order to change this situation .
what I want in my report - and I would like to thank my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w M@@ E@@ P@@ s who have h@@ el@@ p@@ ed in the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting , as well as pre@@ dec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ s who have wor@@ k@@ ed on this d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er - is f@@ our things .
first of all , I would make an ur@@ g@@ ent request to the Commission to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t a directive which pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es for frontier effect reports .
this request has been put to the European Commission and the Member States since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 .
such reports would ob@@ li@@ ge Member States , when ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing their legislation on social security , ta@@ x@@ ation or public health , to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t an as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t a@@ way in order to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the impact on frontier workers .
why ?
not because this will make a@@ m@@ en@@ ds , but because it will help us to op@@ er@@ ate in a pre@@ v@@ en@@ ta@@ tive m@@ an@@ n@@ er ; and help us to pre@@ v@@ ent problems from ar@@ is@@ ing .
my second request to the Council is at long last to in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate the amendments in R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 without any further d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s .
I believe this d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er has been with the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters , the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs M@@ in@@ is@@ ters , for two years now .
it in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a number of im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents for frontier workers , as well as - and Mr D@@ o@@ or@@ n mentioned S@@ L@@ I@@ M y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day - a whole h@@ o@@ s@@ t of pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons which make e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing more si@@ m@@ p@@ le , e@@ as@@ y and more re@@ ad@@ able .
the Council must do something about this ; Parliament has c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on rights on this d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er .
however , the Council must dec@@ i@@ d@@ e un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , and I hope that something can be done there .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , in my opinion , the Commission should be more al@@ er@@ t when it comes to all b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ta@@ x@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents which are being con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , in order to ch@@ ec@@ k whether the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by tax law should be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t into line with social security in the country of employment , are being u@@ p@@ held . this is to pre@@ v@@ ent problems ar@@ is@@ ing and to pre@@ v@@ ent people from f@@ al@@ l@@ ing between two st@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
as far as this is concerned , the Commission should get its ac@@ t together a b@@ it more , and ch@@ ec@@ k and ver@@ i@@ fy the b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ta@@ x@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents more , also in the pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary p@@ ha@@ ses .
the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th point I want to make concerns m@@ ed@@ ical ex@@ pen@@ ses , or the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ ing from pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons for m@@ ed@@ ical c@@ are in another Member State .
Court j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments have been pa@@ s@@ sed on this .
this is another area where p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans have let themselves down .
there are j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice , K@@ o@@ h@@ l@@ l @-@ D@@ ec@@ k@@ er being the most pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent , and I know a few people from my own region , which is a b@@ order region , who w@@ ent to Court .
Mr President , n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the Member States n@@ or the Commission have ever su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted any no@@ tes to Parliament on this matter .
that is s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ king .
we should not le@@ a@@ ve matters in the h@@ an@@ ds of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts ; we as p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans must be able to do something about this .
I know very well that when the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous Commissioner , Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n , was in o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , a no@@ te was being c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ted .
I know that the ou@@ t@@ come of this was th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be un@@ p@@ le@@ as@@ ant .
but it does mean that for once - and I would like to pu@@ s@@ h the Commission in this respect - we had c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity and transparency .
the position of ac@@ tive frontier workers , but also that of p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ ac@@ tive frontier workers is at st@@ a@@ k@@ e here .
as far as K@@ o@@ h@@ l@@ l @-@ D@@ ec@@ k@@ er is concerned , it ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to all people who li@@ ve n@@ e@@ a@@ r the b@@ order .
I would ask the M@@ E@@ P@@ s to vote in favour of the report and certainly also for the amendments which I have tabled .
the reason for this is that frontier work is no longer a problem of the ol@@ d Union of the 1@@ 5 .
it im@@ pa@@ c@@ ts on the day @-@ to @-@ day r@@ un@@ n@@ ing of the market , also with regard to the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries .
I would therefore call for the b@@ ro@@ ad@@ est support possible .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting the situation f@@ ac@@ ed by frontier workers in an own @-@ initiative report from Parliament .
many and v@@ ar@@ i@@ ed are the s@@ it@@ u@@ ations and problems that we continue to en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter in the European internal market , one of the key aspects of which is the freedom of movement of frontier workers .
these are problems which cause the people to question the ra@@ is@@ on d &apos; ê@@ t@@ r@@ e of the European Union .
being an M@@ E@@ P in a region b@@ or@@ d@@ er@@ ing L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and F@@ r@@ an@@ ce I can i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy with all the f@@ ac@@ et@@ s of these issues .
why is a G@@ er@@ m@@ an pen@@ si@@ on@@ er , who is under@@ going di@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , only per@@ m@@ it@@ ted to have access to this for a l@@ im@@ ited per@@ i@@ o@@ d of time when h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ ying in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce ?
the mo@@ th@@ er of a family in G@@ er@@ many is im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly ent@@ it@@ led to ch@@ il@@ d b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it for her second ch@@ il@@ d , but not if her h@@ u@@ s@@ b@@ and wor@@ ks in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
is it per@@ mis@@ si@@ ble for an a@@ un@@ t who is in@@ su@@ red in B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m to be c@@ a@@ re@@ d for in a n@@ ur@@ sing h@@ om@@ e n@@ e@@ a@@ r her family in G@@ er@@ many ?
pen@@ sion ent@@ it@@ l@@ em@@ ents ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red in I@@ t@@ al@@ y are subject to en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ou@@ t@@ la@@ y before they re@@ ac@@ h the G@@ er@@ m@@ an pen@@ si@@ on@@ er .
and why should an h@@ on@@ or@@ ary ma@@ y@@ or working in G@@ er@@ many su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly have to pa@@ y tax on his whole s@@ al@@ ary , which he e@@ ar@@ n@@ s in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , because he rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es an ex@@ pen@@ ses al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance ?
L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g f@@ ir@@ m@@ s are fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting against ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e and ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al costs , and so j@@ o@@ b@@ s are at r@@ is@@ k .
this is why people dec@@ line the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e of ma@@ y@@ or .
the l@@ is@@ t g@@ o@@ es on .
frontier workers must be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , so as to be able to c@@ op@@ e with the con@@ f@@ u@@ sion of la@@ ws on both si@@ d@@ es of the b@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
those who look for a j@@ o@@ b over the b@@ order within the European internal market need legal c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y in a un@@ ited Europe , particularly in the s@@ p@@ here of social legislation .
we M@@ E@@ P@@ s from the b@@ order regions in the European Union call upon the Commission and the Council , to provide for more c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order social j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
we have ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed a great deal , but there is still much to be done .
the report by Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te d@@ em@@ an@@ ds of the people in the b@@ order regions .
the internal market must also be com@@ p@@ le@@ ted within the la@@ b@@ our market if we want to make Europe an in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted whole .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to be@@ g@@ in by th@@ an@@ king R@@ i@@ a O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for the s@@ ou@@ n@@ d cooperation we en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed within the framework of this report .
I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t it was a s@@ pl@@ en@@ did idea to d@@ u@@ st down a number of re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments which this Parliament put forward in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 further to an own @-@ initiative report and following my own report which is based on a frontier workers p@@ et@@ ition .
it has to be said : not a great deal has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king over the past three years .
we have often said that b@@ order regions are good b@@ ar@@ om@@ e@@ ters for European in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion .
if this is the case , then I do not think in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion is in ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly good s@@ ha@@ p@@ e these d@@ a@@ y@@ s , because , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t for the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice , little progress has been made .
mo@@ re@@ over , I also re@@ g@@ re@@ t the fact that the frontier effect te@@ st has not even been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the social agenda and that the Treaty of Nice has not made any decisions with regard to R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 , which only com@@ pl@@ ic@@ a@@ tes matters .
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the world mo@@ v@@ es on , and in all m@@ an@@ n@@ er of countries , tax re@@ for@@ m@@ s are under way , social security legislation is in full s@@ w@@ ing , st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ ch@@ em@@ es are being su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted with ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al s@@ ch@@ em@@ es , and quite a few countries , in a b@@ i@@ d to re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ e work , family and le@@ is@@ ur@@ e time , are com@@ ing up with all k@@ in@@ ds of s@@ ch@@ em@@ es for c@@ a@@ re@@ er b@@ re@@ a@@ ks which will only apply to the country &apos; s own citizens and unfortunately not to frontier workers .
I am therefore in to@@ ta@@ l agreement with the European Commission , which in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an c@@ a@@ re@@ er b@@ re@@ a@@ k s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , which - I re@@ g@@ re@@ t to say - does not co@@ v@@ er D@@ u@@ t@@ ch citizens , w@@ h@@ il@@ st the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch s@@ ch@@ em@@ e does apply to B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ ans .
frontier workers have an ad@@ ded dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge com@@ pa@@ red to other citizens who a@@ va@@ i@@ l themselves of the free movement of per@@ s@@ ons principle .
they often work in one country and li@@ ve in another , and pa@@ y ta@@ x@@ es in one country and their social con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions in another .
to have some co@@ h@@ er@@ ence between the tax policy and social security system in one country would already be something , but to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t this to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en between countries is nothing sh@@ or@@ t of u@@ to@@ p@@ i@@ a . as a result , frontier workers continue to be at the rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing end of this un@@ sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y situation .
even the most d@@ y@@ ed @-@ in @-@ the @-@ w@@ o@@ o@@ l European f@@ ed@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s a@@ m@@ on@@ g us d@@ are not d@@ re@@ am of a time when we could ever achieve the u@@ to@@ p@@ i@@ an v@@ is@@ i@@ on of a h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised social security system or h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised ta@@ x@@ ation ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s Europe .
we must therefore look for c@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ ve s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions .
I would like to m@@ en@@ tion two .
first of all , the O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en report is right to b@@ re@@ a@@ the new life into the E@@ P re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment on com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y frontier effect reports on the part of the Member States in all le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive ch@@ an@@ g@@ es which per@@ ta@@ in to social security and ta@@ x@@ ation , with com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion for frontier workers to b@@ al@@ ance out any d@@ ra@@ w@@ b@@ ac@@ ks , a practice which , in fact , is already being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted in some countries , al@@ be@@ it with some re@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ ce .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , my group has some di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty with the fact that Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en t@@ on@@ ed down the te@@ x@@ t at the time .
we believe that the te@@ st must re@@ main in place as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ency and that com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion must be made com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y .
secondly , we must have the c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge to take the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 a little further .
we were un@@ able to h@@ al@@ t the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an r@@ ou@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ e for frontier workers at the time .
we must , at long last , op@@ t for one le@@ v@@ y principle , either in the country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence or the country of employment .
I think there is a whole ra@@ f@@ t of ar@@ gu@@ ments in favour of the country of employment .
I think that , acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , my group will be v@@ o@@ ting against the amendments tabled by Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en and against those of Mr M@@ an@@ d@@ ers who w@@ an@@ ts to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate this principle .
I hope that this report will em@@ er@@ ge from the pl@@ en@@ ary un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed and that frontier workers can at long last make some more he@@ ad@@ way .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en for the h@@ u@@ ge a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of work she has done .
she , h@@ er@@ s@@ el@@ f , has also in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated that this is an important issue for which little is being done , for which p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly have any con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation , and , as we can see , it is extremely difficult to l@@ end this matter some c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity .
despite this , I have some ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions in this respect , which is also ap@@ par@@ ent from my amendments .
I , m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , li@@ ve in a b@@ order region and every day , I see people from my area who com@@ m@@ u@@ te to another country . whether this is G@@ er@@ many or B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , they c@@ ro@@ s@@ s the b@@ order at any ra@@ te .
what I have no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed is that the regulation on social security , No 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 , also ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to workers who dec@@ i@@ d@@ e to mo@@ ve to the country of employment and actually li@@ ve there .
I welcome c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity in this matter , and I have tabled two amendments to this effect .
I agree with this position and I have also t@@ ol@@ d Mrs O@@ om@@ en .
but I do believe that we should in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a c@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ at so that , if it trans@@ p@@ i@@ res that after e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ te@@ en m@@ on@@ th@@ s or two years , an as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment should be made and if , based on this as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment , it ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s that frontier workers are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing dis@@ pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ ate d@@ ra@@ w@@ b@@ ac@@ ks , a different c@@ h@@ o@@ ice can be made , and I would like to see this c@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ at in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the report .
Mrs O@@ om@@ en ta@@ k@@ es the country of employment as the gu@@ i@@ d@@ ing principle .
I believe that it is not so e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent that the country of employment principle always wor@@ ks in the interests of , and b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its , the frontier workers .
I am of the opinion that we work to li@@ ve and not the other way r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
for that reason , I believe that all the money and c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ti@@ es we ob@@ ta@@ in on the s@@ h@@ o@@ p f@@ l@@ o@@ or should be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be@@ a@@ r in our li@@ v@@ ing environment .
that is why I am in favour of con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of using the country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence principle .
I have in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded the above in an amendment .
I would therefore ask my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w M@@ E@@ P@@ s to vote in favour of this amendment .
I have also tabled two amendments to A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 6 and 7 to have these d@@ el@@ e@@ ted , because I believe that the Commission is not com@@ p@@ et@@ ent to take measures to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e in b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
Mr President , I also wish to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for her work on this issue .
I share many of her c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s and f@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tions about the sc@@ op@@ e , implementation and s@@ p@@ e@@ ed of change to R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 .
as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons , it is clear to me that there is a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able and g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing number of re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , including third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als and frontier workers , for w@@ h@@ o@@ m the current ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents are not working sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ il@@ y .
enlargement will make a com@@ p@@ le@@ x system of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation even more com@@ p@@ le@@ x and it is not sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union ta@@ k@@ es the free movement of citizens as s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly as it ta@@ k@@ es its commitment to the free movement of g@@ o@@ od@@ s .
we have to find a way of si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying things for citizens themselves and for the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of these systems .
it would not be sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing if we were to he@@ a@@ r an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing number of c@@ al@@ l@@ s for a s@@ in@@ g@@ le European ag@@ ency that would deal di@@ rec@@ tly with national ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tions on the citizens &apos; behalf .
the call for a directive concerning frontier effect reports is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed .
at least these would be pro@@ ac@@ tive and could h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly deal with some of the problems before they ar@@ ise , which would make a p@@ le@@ as@@ ant change .
it is also clear that as more countries in@@ te@@ gra@@ te their ta@@ x@@ ation and social security systems , we need to take action to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the re@@ su@@ l@@ ting an@@ om@@ al@@ ies , which can result in d@@ ou@@ ble pa@@ y@@ ments .
however , the key issue is that Member States need to pro@@ ve their commitment to free movement by ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing problems op@@ en@@ ly and in a s@@ p@@ ir@@ it which f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s re@@ si@@ d@@ ents of the European Union .
the debate is su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded until 3 p@@ .@@ m .
we shall now pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to the vote .
Mr President , on a point of order .
as more and more Members come into the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , I would like to an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ ce a welcome in@@ no@@ va@@ tion .
we have today op@@ en@@ ed a s@@ mo@@ king z@@ one be@@ h@@ in@@ d the H@@ em@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le , a l@@ o@@ v@@ el@@ y su@@ n@@ n@@ y place with l@@ o@@ t@@ s of good v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
I hope that all c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es who continue to r@@ u@@ in their health by s@@ mo@@ king , will find themselves com@@ for@@ ta@@ b@@ ly in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ed ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er and will st@@ o@@ p s@@ mo@@ king in the non @-@ s@@ mo@@ king z@@ on@@ es .
I hope e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y has he@@ ar@@ d that .
thank you , Mrs B@@ an@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ i , for l@@ o@@ o@@ king after the interests of non @-@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I welcome the fact that there is now going to be a s@@ mo@@ king rather than a non @-@ s@@ mo@@ king z@@ one .
I hope now that all Members and all members of st@@ a@@ f@@ f ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve the no @-@ s@@ mo@@ king areas ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the whole of the European Parliament b@@ u@@ il@@ ding .
I am still having problems being able to get into the part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion and being able to get in and out of committee m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s , both here and in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
so I p@@ le@@ a@@ d with e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y , now there is a s@@ mo@@ king area , to use it and not the no @-@ s@@ mo@@ king areas , including the cor@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ or@@ s and going up to the li@@ f@@ t .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I was just w@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ ing whether an@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y is going to in@@ for@@ m the par@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es of s@@ mo@@ k@@ e where the s@@ mo@@ king z@@ one and the no @-@ s@@ mo@@ king z@@ on@@ es are .
we shall now pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to the vote .
vote
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es the vote .
ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations O@@ F V@@ O@@ T@@ E
P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for second re@@ ad@@ ing ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 6@@ 9 / 2000 )
Mr President , I was a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d I was going to have to make my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations of vote in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing .
I was concerned in case my f@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red f@@ o@@ o@@ t pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted me from s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king .
however , I hope that I am not one who often pu@@ ts his f@@ o@@ o@@ t in it when he op@@ en@@ s his m@@ ou@@ th and that I will be able to make my u@@ su@@ al contribution to the pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s .
well then , I would like to dec@@ l@@ are my support for the P@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ s report and call for a European B@@ an@@ k to be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in practice .
in recent d@@ a@@ y@@ s , I am g@@ la@@ d to say , the e@@ ur@@ o has g@@ a@@ in@@ ed against the d@@ ol@@ la@@ r and the p@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
I would therefore like to take the opportunity p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by this ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion at the European m@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y policy and to call for an increase in the European B@@ an@@ k &apos;s ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities , including the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es throughout Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 to the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t directive on the re@@ organisation and w@@ in@@ ding up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions has received ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity support .
this is extremely re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble because it will give third @-@ par@@ ty c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s the opportunity to g@@ a@@ in access to the general resources as a result , which will mean that m@@ or@@ t@@ g@@ ag@@ es or@@ de@@ red ab@@ road for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of the b@@ an@@ k will no longer be com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve .
this is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
this , to my mind , is reason enough to re@@ j@@ ec@@ t this report .
that is what I have done , and I re@@ g@@ re@@ t that the Commission &apos; s common position in its present form f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity support .
the objective of the Commission re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation is to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s &apos; rights in the e@@ v@@ ent of the w@@ in@@ ding up of c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions Union @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e .
yet no@@ where is there any specific m@@ en@@ tion of the rights which the em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es of the c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions in question ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to have .
a number of national le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive systems do ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es as c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s , but they are only , at best , ent@@ it@@ led to the pa@@ y@@ ment of their w@@ ag@@ es due .
they rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve no com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion , on the other hand , for the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of their j@@ o@@ b , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of their future w@@ ag@@ es , even though there are at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to guarantee that c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s will rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion for the su@@ m@@ s they are o@@ w@@ ed , in other words their c@@ ap@@ it@@ al , the s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of their future in@@ come .
em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es be@@ a@@ r no responsibility in the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es of b@@ an@@ ks or c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions since they have had no part in taking decisions .
they are the on@@ es that should be com@@ pen@@ sa@@ ted first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most for the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of their j@@ o@@ b@@ s .
we voted against this re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation which is concerned only with c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ or@@ s , and not with the em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es who do the work of r@@ un@@ n@@ ing these c@@ re@@ d@@ it institutions .
S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for second re@@ ad@@ ing ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 7@@ 5 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the S@@ an@@ d@@ ers @-@ t@@ en H@@ ol@@ te report .
a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s ago , I was the gu@@ est of a uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of the third age , where people go because they want to le@@ ar@@ n rather then m@@ e@@ re@@ ly to get a c@@ er@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate .
these uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities are , of course , f@@ re@@ qu@@ en@@ ted by many el@@ d@@ er@@ ly people .
the he@@ a@@ d of this uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity - the uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of the third age of B@@ er@@ g@@ a@@ m@@ o , where I li@@ ve - was la@@ m@@ en@@ ting the fact that there is no gra@@ ding l@@ is@@ t or quality evaluation of uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities of the third age .
he said to me : &quot; many uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities are p@@ o@@ or@@ ly or@@ g@@ an@@ ised , but ou@@ r@@ s is well or@@ g@@ an@@ ised .
therefore , you should m@@ en@@ tion in your ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote that it would be as well for some interest to be taken in the quality of uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities of the third age too . &quot;
we certainly have nothing against &quot; European cooperation in quality evaluation of sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l education &quot; , but it is a well k@@ no@@ w@@ n fact that the quality of education de@@ pen@@ ds on the resources made available to state sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
in order to provide high @-@ quality education , we need su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , c@@ la@@ s@@ ses with l@@ im@@ ited st@@ u@@ d@@ ent n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers and a great many te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ ts , te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive and technical st@@ a@@ f@@ f at all levels of education , st@@ ar@@ ting with pr@@ im@@ ary c@@ la@@ s@@ ses .
throughout Europe , di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences start to s@@ how at pr@@ im@@ ary level , c@@ a@@ using children from working c@@ la@@ s@@ s areas to f@@ all be@@ h@@ in@@ d in their education at this stage in an often ir@@ re@@ ver@@ si@@ ble way .
in order to mo@@ ve towards h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation in Europe , we first need to al@@ i@@ g@@ n ourselves with the countries that al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ate the most resources to education .
even in those countries , however , there is a t@@ en@@ d@@ ency to c@@ u@@ t back on the resources al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to education and , more g@@ en@@ er@@ ally , to public services in favour of other b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e , ma@@ in@@ ly aid and g@@ r@@ an@@ ts given to cor@@ por@@ ations or , rather , their o@@ w@@ n@@ ers .
if the resources al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to education are not in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d throughout the European Union , especially in those that have the l@@ o@@ w@@ est levels of funding , the European re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on quality of education will re@@ main a p@@ i@@ ous hope .
.
the main th@@ r@@ u@@ st of this report re@@ la@@ tes to the need for greater European cooperation in e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ating the quality of education within our over@@ all sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l systems in the EU T@@ his could pro@@ ve quite a v@@ al@@ u@@ able ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise because different EU governments can m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ ally b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully pro@@ v@@ en ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al programmes that have been t@@ ri@@ ed and te@@ st@@ ed within the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al system in Europe .
we should also rec@@ all that this is now even more important in li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the new information society that is now upon us .
EU le@@ ad@@ ers in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al last year la@@ i@@ d down a framework of proposals w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by training in the use of the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t would be ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded to all pr@@ im@@ ary and se@@ con@@ d@@ ary sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union .
this is a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally important social and economic objective if the European Union is to take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of new e @-@ com@@ m@@ er@@ ce and re@@ la@@ ted b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
the re@@ al@@ ity is that new information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es are ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing all the time .
this means that ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al training in the field of information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y is also ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing all the time .
that is why the European Union must res@@ p@@ on@@ d in a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated and st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red m@@ an@@ n@@ er so as to guarantee that the best ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s in the field of information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y are available to all our st@@ u@@ d@@ ents .
this will ensure a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er quality of education and will also ensure that a st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ation is la@@ i@@ d to en@@ ti@@ ce new information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es to be set up and l@@ o@@ c@@ ated within the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies of the European Union .
cooperation in the field of education has been a pro@@ v@@ en su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s within the European Union in recent years .
currently , 1@@ 8 countries par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the E@@ ra@@ s@@ m@@ u@@ s programme , including countries from E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n and C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l Europe .
ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 9@@ 0 000 st@@ u@@ d@@ ents b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from this initiative on an an@@ n@@ u@@ al basis .
while I welcome the pro@@ v@@ en su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of the E@@ ra@@ s@@ m@@ u@@ s initiative , I would rec@@ all that there is certainly ro@@ o@@ m for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in the m@@ an@@ n@@ er in which this s@@ ch@@ em@@ e is ad@@ min@@ is@@ te@@ red now within the European Union .
still st@@ u@@ d@@ ents are en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ ing financial problems while st@@ u@@ d@@ ying ab@@ road .
I do not support a system of in@@ e@@ quality between the levels of funding available to st@@ u@@ d@@ ents from the various Member States par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating in the E@@ ra@@ s@@ m@@ u@@ s programme .
I would st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly ur@@ ge the E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation M@@ in@@ is@@ ters from within the EU to put in place a system which el@@ im@@ in@@ a@@ tes any el@@ ement of in@@ e@@ quality with regard to the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of the E@@ ra@@ s@@ m@@ u@@ s programme .
we should rec@@ all that it is a very good policy of the European Union to encourage st@@ u@@ d@@ ents to st@@ u@@ d@@ y in other EU Member States .
this a@@ f@@ for@@ ds real and t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble opportunities for st@@ u@@ d@@ ents to improve their p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al l@@ an@@ gu@@ age s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s while pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing the free movement of per@@ s@@ ons ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the EU .
de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 2 / 2000 )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mrs de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c &apos; s report , not just because I feel it is very positive and th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h , but because we are going to have to de@@ vote a great deal more attention to this th@@ em@@ e in future .
I also believe that not only do we need to under@@ take the necessary public wor@@ ks , as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for in this report , we must also make more funding available , so as to achieve the necessary level of acc@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ an@@ ce a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the general public for these areas .
a great deal still re@@ ma@@ in@@ s to be done , but we are on the right tra@@ c@@ k .
that is why I voted in favour .
Mr President , I voted against this report .
and why did the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party vote against Mrs de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c &apos;s report ?
because , before I le@@ f@@ t for S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , I m@@ e@@ t a for@@ m@@ er Member of the European Parliament , Mrs M@@ on@@ ic@@ a B@@ al@@ d@@ i , who is very a@@ u f@@ a@@ it with cultural issues . while we were dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing this report over a good co@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ e in a b@@ a@@ r , she said to me : &quot; why is it that this report h@@ op@@ es to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of cultural s@@ it@@ es l@@ is@@ ted in I@@ t@@ al@@ y ?
it &apos; s not the qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity but the quality of s@@ it@@ es that c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts .
it is h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly our f@@ a@@ ul@@ t that I@@ t@@ al@@ y has so many an@@ c@@ i@@ ent m@@ on@@ u@@ ments to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve . &quot;
Mrs de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c &apos;s report s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s w@@ il@@ l@@ ing and con@@ ta@@ in@@ s certain con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive proposals , which is why the M@@ E@@ P@@ s of the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e voted in favour of it .
however , we fe@@ a@@ r that these proposals will f@@ all on de@@ a@@ f e@@ ar@@ s .
we all know that our cultural and natural heritage r@@ is@@ ks being w@@ i@@ p@@ ed out by ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities which d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge or d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y the ur@@ b@@ an and local f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c in which pr@@ ic@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es of our cultural and natural heritage are to be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve and un@@ con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed use of land , b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s s@@ pr@@ in@@ g@@ ing up in h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic to@@ w@@ n c@@ ent@@ res , in the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e and in g@@ re@@ en b@@ el@@ ts and the lack of any pro@@ per measures to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and the natural environment are e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of our ra@@ p@@ e of the natural and cultural l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
of course , this is not the r@@ an@@ d@@ o@@ m work of a few v@@ il@@ la@@ in@@ s , it is the di@@ rec@@ t con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of a policy which com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ es e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing and is d@@ ri@@ v@@ en s@@ ol@@ el@@ y by the prof@@ it mo@@ tive .
a t@@ y@@ p@@ ical example is the T@@ V@@ X G@@ ol@@ d s@@ it@@ e in O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ i@@ ad@@ a , in H@@ al@@ k@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ k@@ i , n@@ e@@ a@@ r S@@ ta@@ y@@ ir@@ a , the b@@ ir@@ th@@ place of A@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ o@@ t@@ le , where the f@@ o@@ re@@ st has been d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed and m@@ on@@ u@@ ments have been put at r@@ is@@ k . as if that were not enough , the re@@ si@@ d@@ ents in the area have been d@@ ra@@ g@@ g@@ ed through the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts and s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ ed for d@@ ar@@ ing to de@@ f@@ end their h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic and natural environment .
we could c@@ ite n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous other ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion in@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ted or which it is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed to in@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ t in order to stage the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ i@@ c G@@ a@@ m@@ es in A@@ th@@ en@@ s in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 .
not only does the European Union do nothing to ch@@ ec@@ k and deal with these in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents ; on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , it is the main ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ate of this policy .
it funds projects on ar@@ c@@ ha@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical s@@ it@@ es which will b@@ ur@@ y and d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y an@@ c@@ i@@ ent m@@ on@@ u@@ ments - w@@ it@@ ness the case of the A@@ c@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ is M@@ u@@ se@@ u@@ m .
the G@@ re@@ e@@ k Government is re@@ p@@ e@@ al@@ ing A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 4 of the C@@ on@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion as we speak , th@@ e@@ re@@ by ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ing what little le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive protection there was for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and without the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ te@@ st ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion on the part of the Å@@ U .
the Å@@ U has a pen@@ ch@@ ant for w@@ a@@ x@@ ing l@@ y@@ r@@ ical about c@@ ul@@ ture , but while it pre@@ ac@@ h@@ es that cultural heritage is a b@@ a@@ si@@ c f@@ ac@@ to@@ r in the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity and h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical development of a society , it has done nothing to get the E@@ l@@ g@@ in mar@@ b@@ l@@ es re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed to the natural and h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic s@@ it@@ e of which they form an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l part , even as a g@@ e@@ st@@ ur@@ e of respect for our cultural and h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic heritage and for the need to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic m@@ on@@ u@@ ments .
it is also in@@ different to the fact that m@@ on@@ u@@ ments in North C@@ y@@ pr@@ us are being p@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ de@@ red and v@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ is@@ ed by the Turkish o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ ying for@@ c@@ es .
finally , it be@@ ar@@ s a h@@ u@@ ge responsibility for the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of m@@ on@@ u@@ ments during the b@@ om@@ b@@ ing c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n against Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a .
this situation cannot be rec@@ ti@@ fied with h@@ al@@ f measures or w@@ is@@ h@@ ful th@@ in@@ king or , of course , within the context of a market p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y .
we need to mo@@ b@@ il@@ ise the ma@@ s@@ ses , all the cultural ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es , all the workers , and we need to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a different policy , one which res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts the working m@@ an and the f@@ r@@ u@@ its of his c@@ re@@ ation .
.
the E@@ L@@ D@@ R Group con@@ si@@ d@@ ers that the de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c report is a very important contribution to better protection of world cultural and natural heritage .
we are of the opinion that the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion for the P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l and N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l H@@ er@@ it@@ age in the EU is a ta@@ s@@ k for Member States rather than for the European Community .
it is difficult for us to see the ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e of EU in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion in this matter .
the E@@ L@@ D@@ R amendments to the de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c report re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t this position .
th@@ us , for reasons of lack of ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e and the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity the E@@ L@@ D@@ R Group will ab@@ st@@ a@@ in in the fin@@ al vote .
pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting and pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing our heritage in each Member State is f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally important as , in so doing , we are sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding our i@@ d@@ ent@@ ities and special ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s w@@ h@@ il@@ st still res@@ p@@ ec@@ ting di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences .
our heritage , be it cultural , ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l , economic or natural , is the le@@ g@@ ac@@ y of our past and in pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting it we are not fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting a re@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ d action . on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that we are pre@@ par@@ ing for our future .
the a@@ u@@ th@@ or E@@ r@@ n@@ est R@@ en@@ an w@@ ro@@ te that the only t@@ r@@ u@@ e men of progress are those who take a de@@ e@@ p @-@ se@@ ated respect for the past as their st@@ ar@@ ting point .
we must , therefore , take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the w@@ e@@ al@@ th of our past , our heritage , our ro@@ o@@ t@@ s and our tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons , even the very ol@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t , in order to pre@@ par@@ e for the future .
this cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and w@@ e@@ al@@ th will allow us to g@@ a@@ in a better under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of ourselves .
to achieve this , however , we must respect all the di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of our various h@@ er@@ it@@ ag@@ es , all our di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences , and the only way to do this is to in@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ e the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity principle .
in line with this principle we can p@@ res@@ er@@ ve , de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p and trans@@ m@@ it our heritage , c@@ ul@@ ture and tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
when these dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r or f@@ ad@@ e a@@ way ( in the way of h@@ un@@ ting , rural life and g@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ ic tra@@ d@@ ition ) we are b@@ re@@ a@@ king the c@@ ha@@ in of trans@@ mis@@ sion by which we hand down our w@@ e@@ al@@ th and our way of life and this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s about cultural im@@ p@@ o@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ment . at the end of the day , we will c@@ re@@ ate a m@@ ou@@ l@@ d into which everyone has to f@@ it in order to li@@ ve in an in@@ si@@ p@@ i@@ d but more m@@ al@@ le@@ able society that can be con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed by &apos; r@@ ul@@ ers and g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ or@@ s &apos; .
that is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
therefore , to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t , p@@ res@@ er@@ ve and promote our heritage , we must sa@@ ve our ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture , support our ar@@ ts and c@@ ra@@ f@@ t industry , p@@ res@@ er@@ ve and en@@ h@@ an@@ ce the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of our c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e , but I would like to st@@ res@@ s that we must not w@@ ra@@ p it in co@@ t@@ t@@ on w@@ o@@ o@@ l or ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the cultural tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons and c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s which are p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ised there .
in so doing , we must also respect the right to be different and help to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve all these v@@ al@@ u@@ es since rural life has its own ri@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ ful place in this pre@@ d@@ om@@ in@@ an@@ tly ur@@ b@@ an society .
therefore , to come back to the report , it is , of course , important to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the heritage of both the European Union and third countries , but it is e@@ qu@@ ally important and v@@ it@@ al to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the heritage of our own countries and regions .
we are therefore p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to no@@ te the proposals to take our heritage into account in the various training programmes set up to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t and re@@ st@@ or@@ e our heritage .
the same g@@ o@@ es for funding and support of the ar@@ ts and c@@ ra@@ f@@ t industry , a sector which c@@ re@@ a@@ tes many j@@ o@@ b@@ s , as long as it is not su@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ ated by un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c per@@ n@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ ty re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , as has been possible for market tra@@ d@@ ers .
we must however state our res@@ er@@ va@@ tions regarding the European re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions which , on the pre@@ te@@ x@@ t of environmental protection ( a term ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed too n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly ) , will s@@ er@@ ve only to w@@ i@@ p@@ e out local tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons and c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s that are a v@@ it@@ al part of the local c@@ ul@@ ture of our regions .
yet , this is the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite of what this report se@@ ts out to achieve and so , although we support the report , we are ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ing from the vote for this reason .
since 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 2 , when the U@@ N@@ E@@ S@@ C@@ O G@@ en@@ er@@ al C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence adopted the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion C@@ on@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ ing the P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l and N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l H@@ er@@ it@@ age , which has already been si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by 1@@ 5@@ 8 countries , including the 1@@ 5 Member States of the European Union , 6@@ 3@@ 0 s@@ it@@ es have been ad@@ ded to the world heritage l@@ is@@ t , 3@@ 0 % of which are in European Union countries ( 1@@ 8@@ 8 ) , and of those 1@@ 0 are in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al .
it is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous , however , that c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ f@@ ying s@@ it@@ es as world heritage s@@ it@@ es is not enough .
every m@@ e@@ a@@ sure must be taken to support their con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion , including financial measures , as we have done with the proposals that we have tabled for the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
as the rapporteur h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted , there is an im@@ b@@ al@@ ance between European countries and the re@@ st of the world with regard to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised natural and cultural s@@ it@@ es , and therefore third countries must be su@@ p@@ por@@ ted and en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged , in a w@@ i@@ d@@ e @-@ r@@ an@@ g@@ ing approach , to ad@@ d to the l@@ is@@ t of natural and cultural heritage , so that they can be a@@ f@@ for@@ ded protection .
it is also important for Member States to com@@ p@@ ly with ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing directives , and in particular the environmental impact as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment directive on as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the impact of specific public and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te projects on cultural and natural heritage , as the report st@@ a@@ tes .
this is clear when you tra@@ v@@ e@@ l ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the Union and see how the di@@ ver@@ se s@@ p@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al t@@ r@@ en@@ ds over the c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ri@@ es have been em@@ b@@ o@@ di@@ ed in our m@@ on@@ u@@ ments , ar@@ t@@ is@@ ti@@ c st@@ y@@ l@@ es , v@@ al@@ u@@ e systems , re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous and s@@ p@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al t@@ r@@ en@@ ds , and sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s of p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ical and s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t .
in sh@@ or@@ t , and in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es , we must go de@@ e@@ p@@ er with our European cultural policy , su@@ p@@ por@@ ting and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting our cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r which in t@@ u@@ r@@ n defin@@ es the European Union . the de V@@ e@@ y@@ ra@@ c report is a la@@ u@@ d@@ able contribution towards this .
D@@ o@@ or@@ n report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 1 / 2000 )
Mr President , I am sure you will l@@ is@@ t@@ en c@@ a@@ re@@ fully to my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote in support of this report .
I am in favour of an@@ y@@ th@@ ing which st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ es or si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ies , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed that the process is not too ti@@ res@@ om@@ e for those under@@ going the st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing and is carried out ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ally .
I therefore st@@ res@@ s that , in this op@@ er@@ ation of si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying and st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing Community legislation on the social security co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation sector - to which this report re@@ f@@ ers - we must be@@ a@@ r in mind that it would be appropriate for workers who work in more than one State of the European Union to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve a s@@ in@@ g@@ le pen@@ sion from a s@@ in@@ g@@ le pen@@ sion o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e rather than part of it from one State , part of it from another State and part of it from yet another .
thank you Mr F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o .
the more I l@@ is@@ t@@ en to you the more I re@@ al@@ ise that I will know your life h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y before long .
given that we are op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to a market ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , we shall not adopt any position on the al@@ le@@ g@@ ed si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of the internal market .
we are therefore ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ing from the vote on this report .
however , on the aspects that may a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the population i@@ .@@ e@@ . the workers , we are in favour of :
si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying social legislation and social security by b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing them into line with countries that have the most f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble s@@ ch@@ em@@ es for workers ;
si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ ying V@@ A@@ T through the uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l ab@@ ol@@ ition of both V@@ A@@ T itself and all con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion ta@@ x@@ es , which are particularly un@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r as they ma@@ in@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t l@@ o@@ w@@ er in@@ come c@@ la@@ s@@ ses , and re@@ pla@@ c@@ ing these with a si@@ z@@ e@@ able increase in cor@@ por@@ ation tax and a st@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ly gra@@ d@@ u@@ ated tax on all for@@ m@@ s of re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e from c@@ ap@@ it@@ al .
v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 7 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the v@@ an d@@ er L@@ a@@ an report .
thank you for your kind words just now . in v@@ o@@ ting for the motion , I would like to draw your attention to the part of the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment which re@@ f@@ ers to assistance to the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an authorities .
I was pr@@ om@@ p@@ ted to do so by the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party in I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l - for the K@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ set in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party in I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l - one of w@@ h@@ o@@ m said to me : &quot; I am g@@ la@@ d you are h@@ el@@ p@@ ing the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans .
in fact , you should give them more and better assistance and ensure that it g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y s@@ er@@ v@@ es to help the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an people , for they t@@ r@@ u@@ ly need it .
indeed , I am sure that , if the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an citizens were in better health and their ec@@ on@@ om@@ y were im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed , there would be less war than I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say there is at the moment . &quot;
I am un@@ able to agree with my group regarding its position on Mr v@@ an D@@ am &apos; s amendment , which I , per@@ s@@ on@@ ally , ch@@ o@@ s@@ e to support .
it is one th@@ ing for the issue of the s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing of an@@ t@@ i @-@ S@@ em@@ it@@ i@@ c pro@@ pa@@ g@@ an@@ d@@ a by P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ bo@@ o@@ ks not to be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge resolution .
I would say that this is a technical problem .
however , to my mind , it is a mis@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ged political si@@ g@@ n@@ al for us to op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e it for this reason al@@ one , i@@ .@@ e@@ . on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of form rather than con@@ t@@ ent .
since si@@ g@@ n@@ ing the O@@ s@@ l@@ o A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , the European Union and its Member States have , to a great ex@@ t@@ ent , su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an education system .
therefore , it is up to us to d@@ em@@ and that the Commission should m@@ on@@ it@@ or more c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y to ensure that the ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al in P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s does not con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te an in@@ c@@ it@@ ement to war , v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence and ra@@ c@@ i@@ al ha@@ t@@ red .
the European Union cannot k@@ e@@ e@@ p ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y su@@ p@@ por@@ ting re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation and peace while con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to t@@ u@@ r@@ n a b@@ l@@ in@@ d e@@ y@@ e to the way EU financial support is being mis@@ ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ated for i@@ d@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical en@@ ds .
indeed , I s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly hope that this issue will very s@@ o@@ on be the subject of a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine debate in Parliament .
we must be f@@ ir@@ m on this issue .
our con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ence will not allow an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , n@@ or will our el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate .
I have voted in favour of the report and especially of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 from Mr v@@ an D@@ am .
it is important for the European Parliament to st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise the an@@ t@@ i @-@ S@@ em@@ it@@ i@@ c st@@ a@@ te@@ ments in te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing resources for P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and for Parliament to call upon the Commission to ensure that the aid given to P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an education does not , either di@@ rec@@ tly or in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , fin@@ ance ra@@ c@@ i@@ al ha@@ t@@ red . in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , the EU &apos; s contribution to the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an education system should in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d promote peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st .
EU aid must , as far as possible , be de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to bring about peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st .
the EU is , a@@ m@@ on@@ g other things , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing aid to the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an education system .
it is prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ly un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate and o@@ f@@ f@@ en@@ si@@ ve that P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l bo@@ o@@ ks should con@@ ta@@ in an@@ t@@ i @-@ S@@ em@@ it@@ i@@ c st@@ a@@ te@@ ments and d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ be I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l - the only democracy in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st - in terms as ab@@ om@@ in@@ able as those of N@@ a@@ z@@ is@@ m .
.
both the rapporteur and the E@@ L@@ D@@ R Group share the s@@ en@@ ti@@ ment ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 regarding concern at the possible use made of EU financial support for in@@ c@@ it@@ ing ra@@ c@@ i@@ al ha@@ t@@ red a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans against their J@@ e@@ wish n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
the B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l Committee is st@@ r@@ ic@@ t in the re@@ m@@ it of a dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge follow @-@ up report to re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ t itself to the con@@ t@@ ents of the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge resolution for the year in question .
this amendment ra@@ is@@ es a new issue on e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence that has rec@@ ently come to li@@ g@@ h@@ t .
the rapporteur is therefore re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ding that the amendment be re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted but that the matter be de@@ al@@ t with more fully in the context of the on@@ going 1999 dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge report .
G@@ ar@@ ri@@ g@@ a P@@ ol@@ le@@ do report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 1 / 2000 )
Mr President , s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have d@@ ra@@ w@@ n attention to a number of problems , including c@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t@@ t@@ e s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling .
I support their concern as it is g@@ en@@ er@@ ally b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed that international c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als are now more in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in c@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t@@ t@@ e s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling than d@@ r@@ u@@ g @-@ tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king as it is more prof@@ it@@ able and less d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous .
we in the EU must res@@ p@@ on@@ d to this problem as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ency .
the prof@@ its from c@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t@@ t@@ e s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling not only line the p@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ts of c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als but also d@@ en@@ y re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e to the EU , which would o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise be used in ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing c@@ an@@ c@@ er , p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty , the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of human rights , et@@ c .
in addition , c@@ he@@ ap@@ er c@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t@@ tes mean greater d@@ an@@ g@@ er to health because of he@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ er to@@ b@@ acc@@ o con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion , and we must en@@ l@@ is@@ t the support of min@@ is@@ ters in national and regional governments in any c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n against this .
the Commission should con@@ ta@@ c@@ t in particular the min@@ is@@ ters of health and education in the N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly , M@@ s de B@@ r@@ u@@ n and Mr M@@ ar@@ t@@ in M@@ c@@ G@@ u@@ in@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s .
I m@@ en@@ tion that because we use education and health programmes to com@@ b@@ at c@@ an@@ c@@ er and the A@@ n@@ d@@ er@@ st@@ own N@@ e@@ ws rec@@ ently re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed the de@@ e@@ p in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of the I@@ R@@ A in il@@ l@@ ic@@ it c@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t@@ t@@ e s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling .
they have l@@ in@@ ks to that organisation .
what better way to dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge the min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al por@@ t@@ f@@ ol@@ i@@ o than to encourage their f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds to st@@ o@@ p this ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
it also under@@ l@@ in@@ es a greater need for w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d p@@ ol@@ ic@@ ing in N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ re@@ land .
Mr President , I voted for this report but with great res@@ er@@ va@@ tions .
before I le@@ f@@ t for S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , I m@@ e@@ t Mr R@@ o@@ t@@ a , a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er who is also from B@@ er@@ g@@ a@@ m@@ o , in a re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ ant .
we t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party and he as@@ k@@ ed me whether I was con@@ t@@ ent with the European Parliament .
I said : &quot; it is such an en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ able j@@ o@@ b !
I am con@@ t@@ ent , I feel at e@@ a@@ se and I have some very good f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds .
even the V@@ ice @-@ P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , such as Mr P@@ ro@@ v@@ an , for example , are very d@@ il@@ i@@ g@@ ent and I like them very much . &quot;
he con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed : &quot; and is e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing working al@@ right in Europe ?
you d@@ on &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ t find y@@ ourselves w@@ a@@ st@@ ing European money every now and again ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; I re@@ p@@ li@@ ed , &quot; e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is working fin@@ e . &quot;
however , I am sa@@ d to say that I then re@@ a@@ d in this report that the national States have not ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed Community legislation on c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ting d@@ u@@ ti@@ es o@@ w@@ ed to the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
I therefore hope that , in future , the c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tion of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es in Europe will work well too .
we have voted in favour of a report on se@@ c@@ ur@@ ities and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es for tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al own resources .
the report as a whole makes s@@ en@@ se .
there are , however , a few points from which we would dis@@ as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ate ourselves .
par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h@@ s 1@@ 5 and 1@@ 6 pa@@ ve the way for in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a s@@ in@@ g@@ le cor@@ pu@@ s j@@ ur@@ is in the EU and for h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al law and the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice in the Member States .
first of all , this is un@@ clearly for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted .
secondly , we are not in favour of h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al legislation and the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice in the Member States .
what we do support is e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing the necessary in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments for com@@ b@@ ating f@@ ra@@ u@@ d in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing EU funds more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
we are in favour of su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the O@@ L@@ A@@ F regulation by se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up a uni@@ t under O@@ L@@ A@@ F to le@@ a@@ d in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations and make it e@@ a@@ si@@ er to follow up c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al cases in the national c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
the uni@@ t must only concern itself with c@@ r@@ im@@ es com@@ m@@ it@@ ted by EU em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es .
in the longer term , con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation should be given to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a European public pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ to@@ r to follow up cases of f@@ ra@@ u@@ d in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing EU funds in the Member States .
we must not , however , have h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation for h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation &apos; s sa@@ k@@ e and , in other areas , the Member States &apos; c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al law and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice are national concerns .
M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 6 / 2000 )
Mr President , although I have mis@@ la@@ i@@ d my no@@ tes , I se@@ e@@ m to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that I voted against the M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in report , which de@@ als with ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and p@@ o@@ w@@ de@@ red m@@ il@@ k .
I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the subject on this o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion because I want to call st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly for g@@ en@@ u@@ ine help to be given to farmers - for this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment does not provide su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent protection for them - and , in particular , because I want to draw attention to the fact that there is currently a h@@ u@@ ge crisis in I@@ t@@ al@@ y over p@@ o@@ w@@ de@@ red and other m@@ il@@ k .
not only is there t@@ al@@ k of ma@@ d co@@ w dis@@ e@@ a@@ se , sa@@ d@@ ly , but , since y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , there has also been t@@ al@@ k of &quot; ma@@ d m@@ il@@ k &quot; in I@@ t@@ al@@ y .
people are sa@@ ying that it might be possible to con@@ tra@@ c@@ t ma@@ d co@@ w dis@@ e@@ a@@ se by d@@ r@@ in@@ king m@@ il@@ k .
this is a t@@ r@@ u@@ ly un@@ for@@ g@@ i@@ va@@ ble th@@ ing to say , and it would be appropriate for the European Union to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e and make it clear that m@@ il@@ k is not ma@@ d but quite he@@ al@@ th@@ y .
this report is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y in its as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of various aspects of the C@@ A@@ P .
for example , the approach adopted in its re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y concerns , for example , when the report ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion at the reform re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al pr@@ ic@@ es and sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , and in@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s on a greater re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion pa@@ y@@ ments , without even m@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ ing the consequences this will have for farmers &apos; in@@ comes .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , together with the principle of co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing , it ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ tes the r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of C@@ A@@ P costs . this is a principle that we re@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
the report also ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion at the Commission &apos; s decision to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the C@@ O@@ M in m@@ il@@ k , which c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts a Court of Auditors &apos; opinion qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ ing the system of m@@ il@@ k quotas and in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s in these la@@ i@@ d down in A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , for@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing that , despite some un@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ ness in the al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of quotas , such as that su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al , this system still man@@ ag@@ es to guarantee a de@@ g@@ re@@ e of protection as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds pr@@ ic@@ es and in@@ comes .
with regard to the p@@ i@@ g sector and an@@ i@@ ma@@ l e@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ em@@ ic@@ s , the report con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es by con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing and su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the proposal to establish funds with con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions from the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers themselves or other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce s@@ ch@@ em@@ es , which is a st@@ e@@ p b@@ ac@@ k@@ w@@ ar@@ ds in relation to the opinion that has already been ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in the G@@ ar@@ o@@ t report , which ar@@ gu@@ ed in favour of such Community @-@ co@@ fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed funds .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , I agree with the rapporteur when he ra@@ is@@ es a very important issue a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting the system of ar@@ able c@@ ro@@ p@@ s , which is the con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion of aid a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st major pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers and in the most pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous regions .
what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed is an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in the situation of small pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers , di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ating support acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the si@@ z@@ e of the f@@ ar@@ m .
it is h@@ ar@@ d to understand how the rapporteur pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses to support small farmers through the measures that he is re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ding .

President .
Mr F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o , if you want to re@@ main st@@ an@@ ding we will just k@@ e@@ e@@ p going as you are the only s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er le@@ f@@ t .
Mr President , my le@@ g g@@ et@@ s ti@@ red e@@ a@@ si@@ ly so I have to si@@ t down every now and again .
with regard to my dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation of vote on the S@@ ta@@ es d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , which concerns the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l and , in particular , the way in which the aid to B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a has been s@@ p@@ ent , I have to say that I have had a meeting with the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers of that region .
they ur@@ g@@ ed me to ask the European Parliament - and I am very ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to do so on this o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion - to ensure that at least part of the aid , by some means or other , re@@ ac@@ h@@ es the el@@ d@@ er@@ ly people of B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a .
&quot; but we can &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ t go ch@@ ec@@ king up on what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s to our money , &quot; I re@@ p@@ li@@ ed .
&quot; but you must , Mr F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o . you must in@@ s@@ is@@ t that the funds are m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d when they re@@ ac@@ h their d@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ ation as well .
we pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers need to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve some of them ! &quot;
Mr President , there is indeed a crisis of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion in farming as Mr P@@ ar@@ ish with his ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise as a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er k@@ no@@ ws well .
if this crisis is particularly ac@@ u@@ te in Mr P@@ ar@@ ish &apos;s own Member State , it is the di@@ rec@@ t result of policies pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by U@@ K governments over the past t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years , and to over@@ come it the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m must re@@ view the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of the F@@ on@@ ta@@ in@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ u A@@ g@@ re@@ ement for its contribution to European Union fin@@ an@@ c@@ es .
this has been dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s for farming .
mo@@ re@@ over , the rapporteur , a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party , must work within his own par@@ ty to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e support for his proposals in the House of C@@ om@@ m@@ ons .
in countries where less than 1@@ 0 % of the population now li@@ v@@ es in rural areas , it is too e@@ as@@ y for governments to si@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ e the needs of these areas , and the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge from this debate must be that they do so at the per@@ i@@ l of their countries .

D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 9 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the D@@ el@@ l &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A@@ l@@ b@@ a report , but I want to st@@ res@@ s that under@@ l@@ ying this vote for the motion is my position as re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party . I wish to make clear my to@@ ta@@ l op@@ position to the now e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed practice of in@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing that the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds and European aid are ad@@ ded to national aid .
so the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds should be ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al aid ? I dis@@ agree .
I feel that European funds should have nothing w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever to do with national fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing or national policies .
European funds must not be ti@@ ed to national funds .
Europe is a se@@ par@@ ate ent@@ ity from its con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ent n@@ ations .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr N@@ e@@ i@@ l P@@ ar@@ ish on the fact that he has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a report which is based on the farmers &apos; re@@ al@@ ity , the re@@ al@@ ity in rural areas , and not on the view from B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
this in itself con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a v@@ al@@ u@@ able contribution to agricultural policy .
but if we now ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the situation , we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people le@@ f@@ t out there who are ma@@ d enough to become farmers in the European Union .
what we need is people who want to take up the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing an ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement , fi@@ ve @-@ le@@ g@@ ged sh@@ e@@ e@@ p as it were , but not ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed through g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c mo@@ di@@ fication .
they se@@ e@@ m to be fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting a l@@ o@@ s@@ ing b@@ att@@ le , if we consider the ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ities which young farmers f@@ ac@@ e , as well as the ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ents they are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er .
to qu@@ o@@ t@@ e just one example - and I am just con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing my own country for a moment - d@@ a@@ ir@@ y farming is a sector where ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is being s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ ised , from the b@@ la@@ de of gra@@ s@@ s right up to the moment that the m@@ il@@ k h@@ its the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
I cannot help d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing a com@@ par@@ is@@ on with ar@@ able farmers and h@@ or@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s who have been re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to k@@ e@@ e@@ p ta@@ b@@ s on the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of their actions on the environment and con@@ su@@ m@@ er f@@ r@@ on@@ t for a long time , and do so with great en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
at the same time , we have to say that in many European countries the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for an@@ i@@ ma@@ l w@@ el@@ f@@ are are a@@ m@@ on@@ g the world &apos; s most st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent .
so w@@ h@@ o@@ ever w@@ an@@ ts to become a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er in Europe must ou@@ t@@ st@@ ri@@ p their c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ par@@ ts el@@ se@@ where in the world .
they need to give the l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and cultural conditions due con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
they must apply the st@@ r@@ ic@@ te@@ st con@@ su@@ m@@ er conditions , su@@ p@@ p@@ ly a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of products , both re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally and in terms of quality , make an@@ i@@ ma@@ l w@@ el@@ f@@ are a to@@ p priority and be responsible for the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t , even once it has le@@ f@@ t the f@@ ar@@ m .
this is what we call social en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ ing as a to@@ p @-@ level s@@ por@@ t .
it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ sh@@ i@@ p , a l@@ o@@ ve of nature and the environment , social or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
for this reason al@@ one , it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is f@@ o@@ c@@ used on the future .
some of the f@@ o@@ c@@ al points could in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m s@@ ch@@ em@@ e l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to quality , l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and environmental protection , but also the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of an ec@@ o @-@ tax in other economic se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , not pa@@ y@@ able by the farmers but by the con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , to fin@@ ance those ex@@ t@@ r@@ a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments which farmers need to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l , and to re@@ in@@ for@@ ce the market position of farmers and con@@ su@@ m@@ ers .
what st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es me in the European Union &apos; s com@@ p@@ et@@ ition policy as a whole , is that although it is en@@ j@@ o@@ ying a great deal of attention , in the food sector , for example , the con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts that is , are gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally g@@ a@@ in@@ ing a m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ y position , and that at the same time s@@ al@@ es from f@@ ar@@ m@@ s , the small @-@ sc@@ al@@ e d@@ im@@ en@@ sion , are still f@@ ra@@ g@@ m@@ en@@ ted .
in that s@@ en@@ se , it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble if both C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers M@@ on@@ t@@ i and B@@ ol@@ k@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ in were more c@@ r@@ it@@ ical in their as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of this area in terms of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
Mr President , no@@ b@@ od@@ y can sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve for one day without food ; it is life re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment number one .
this re@@ qu@@ i@@ res mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers .
this means that food does not just st@@ and for market for@@ c@@ es , but also for public health , l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and nature .
in sh@@ or@@ t , if we re@@ al@@ ise this , then we will know that , in future , young farmers will need to be fi@@ ve @-@ le@@ g@@ ged sh@@ e@@ e@@ p , and in that s@@ en@@ se , d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve more support , more political support than they are rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing at the moment .
H@@ e@@ at@@ on H@@ ar@@ r@@ is report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 5 / 2000 )
Mr President , the H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is report , which I voted in favour of , is a report on the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of the European M@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te and therefore on the situation of the e@@ ur@@ o .
I have already had o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion to congratulate the European s@@ in@@ g@@ le c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency , in other words , the e@@ ur@@ o , on its g@@ a@@ in in st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th in recent w@@ e@@ e@@ ks , but today I would like to call for the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a European b@@ an@@ k .
the E@@ I@@ B - European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k - should be c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the European citizens as an ac@@ t@@ u@@ al b@@ an@@ k , a c@@ re@@ d@@ it in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te as well .
I therefore t@@ r@@ u@@ st that my re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation will be ac@@ ted upon .
the report by Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is con@@ f@@ u@@ ses two issues .
in the n@@ a@@ me of w@@ age m@@ od@@ er@@ ation , it con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ s g@@ r@@ an@@ ting ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary b@@ on@@ u@@ se@@ s to some E@@ C@@ B em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es , which is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
on the other hand , the rapporteur c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ es the E@@ C@@ B for pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing O@@ L@@ A@@ F , the European A@@ n@@ t@@ i @-@ F@@ ra@@ u@@ d Office , from c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out its work .
we believe that this whole issue is extremely important and we support the par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h of the report which &quot; re@@ g@@ re@@ ts clear in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ bility between the public commitment as@@ su@@ m@@ ed by the E@@ C@@ B in its 1999 an@@ n@@ u@@ al report to establish c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cooperation with O@@ L@@ A@@ F and the decision by the E@@ C@@ B itself to pre@@ v@@ ent O@@ L@@ A@@ F from c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying over internal in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations , pen@@ ding the r@@ ul@@ ing by the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice &quot; .
we will vote in support of the report by Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is for this reason .
B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 5 / 2000 )
Mr President , I could not f@@ a@@ i@@ l to give an ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote on my f@@ ri@@ end , Mr B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws &apos; report , upon which I have already s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en during the debate .
the Members of the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e will be v@@ o@@ ting against the B@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ il@@ l @-@ M@@ at@@ th@@ e@@ ws report because the specific &quot; M@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ res on financial assistance for in@@ no@@ va@@ tive and j@@ o@@ b @-@ c@@ re@@ ating S@@ m@@ all and M@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ S@@ i@@ z@@ ed E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es ( S@@ M@@ E@@ s ) &quot; proposed in the report form part of the more general policy ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised by the m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ ies and the EU against S@@ M@@ E@@ s , to which there are three st@@ r@@ an@@ ds :
· S@@ el@@ ec@@ tive support for a small group of what are - by G@@ re@@ e@@ k st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds - m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed and large en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , with a view to con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ating their sa@@ te@@ l@@ l@@ ite role ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ ies and st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing the pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses used to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and production .
· W@@ or@@ s@@ en@@ ing com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve terms for the over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , in a b@@ i@@ d to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the same pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses by the back d@@ o@@ or .
· I@@ n addition to the a@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned , it is clear from all the EU programmes on S@@ M@@ E@@ s that b@@ i@@ g b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s is k@@ e@@ en to &apos; o@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ o@@ a@@ d &apos; ( on to S@@ M@@ E@@ s ) the j@@ o@@ b@@ s which it is for@@ c@@ ed to ab@@ ol@@ ish as it in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s its ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation of the working c@@ la@@ s@@ ses , h@@ el@@ p@@ ed by te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical progress .
this a@@ i@@ m will be th@@ w@@ ar@@ ted by the con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tions in@@ h@@ er@@ ent in the c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t system and therefore has little ch@@ ance of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
it is also important to no@@ te that is@@ ol@@ ated com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , not S@@ M@@ E@@ s as a whole , b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from European programmes .
b@@ i@@ g b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s k@@ no@@ ws only too well that a policy which b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its S@@ M@@ E@@ s as a whole would c@@ re@@ ate an ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ary to be rec@@ k@@ on@@ ed with .
h@@ ence , even if g@@ r@@ an@@ ts under European programmes man@@ age to re@@ ac@@ h small en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es , they cannot be used to ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge , because each of these en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es is in an extremely w@@ e@@ a@@ k position on the c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t market .
a number of ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions on the su@@ b@@ st@@ ance of the specific programmes be@@ ar@@ s out the general com@@ ments made above :
1 .
the l@@ im@@ its on the en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted by these measures ( 2@@ 5@@ 0 em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es and up to G@@ D@@ R 1@@ 4 b@@ il@@ li@@ on in an@@ n@@ u@@ al t@@ u@@ r@@ no@@ v@@ er ) clearly allow what are large com@@ p@@ an@@ ies by G@@ re@@ e@@ k st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it .
in fact , 9@@ 1 % of com@@ p@@ an@@ ies in G@@ re@@ ec@@ e em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y up to 4 per@@ s@@ ons and achieve t@@ u@@ r@@ no@@ v@@ er of up to G@@ D@@ R 6@@ 0 million .
from this point of view , the concern about small en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y report is well @-@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded .
2 .
the to@@ ta@@ l number of S@@ M@@ E@@ s ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted by these measures is n@@ e@@ g@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ble com@@ pa@@ red with the to@@ ta@@ l number of S@@ M@@ E@@ s in the Å@@ U : 7 3@@ 8@@ 7 out of a to@@ ta@@ l of some 1@@ 5 million S@@ M@@ E@@ s in the Å@@ U or 0@@ .@@ 0@@ 5 % of the to@@ ta@@ l number over a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of two years from ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation .
3 .
the to@@ ta@@ l pa@@ i@@ d out by the European funds in g@@ r@@ an@@ ts is dis@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ in@@ g@@ ly l@@ o@@ w and does not a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to a real policy for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of S@@ M@@ E@@ s .
a to@@ ta@@ l of EUR 2@@ 7@@ 3 million has been pa@@ i@@ d out ( G@@ D@@ R 9@@ 3@@ .@@ 6 b@@ il@@ li@@ on ) or EUR 1@@ 8 ( G@@ D@@ R 6 1@@ 7@@ 0 ) per en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
4 .
the results of this policy are even wor@@ se : 2 2@@ 3@@ 8 new j@@ o@@ b@@ s were finally c@@ re@@ ated , com@@ pa@@ red with se@@ ver@@ al million un@@ em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in the Å@@ U , at a c@@ o@@ s@@ t of EUR 1@@ 2@@ 2 000 ( G@@ D@@ R 4@@ 2 million ) each .
5 .
9@@ 7 % of S@@ M@@ E@@ s which b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ited from these measures come under the third st@@ r@@ and of the programmes , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the com@@ p@@ an@@ ies received gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es for funding for which they themselves were w@@ h@@ ol@@ ly responsible .
this be@@ g@@ s the question of how a com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated procedure which c@@ o@@ s@@ t so much and ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed so little can be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted as a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful EU policy .
as far as G@@ re@@ ec@@ e is concerned , it was no@@ where to be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d in the programmes ; no funding w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever c@@ a@@ me our way .
we shall therefore be v@@ o@@ ting against the report in question and the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant Commission proposal .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations of vote .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded at 1 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 3 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
frontier workers ( con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation )
the next it@@ e@@ m is the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of the debate on the situation of frontier workers .
Mr President , I want first of all to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for an excellent report .
many pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts have , of course , been made to use frontier workers &apos; problems as a way in to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing tax legislation as a whole .
however , Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en k@@ no@@ ws that frontier workers do not even con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te h@@ al@@ f a per c@@ ent of the la@@ b@@ our force , that their problems are different from one frontier region to another and that different regional s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions are therefore n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed if frontier workers are to have a better time of it .
I can speak from per@@ s@@ on@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , having s@@ p@@ ent 2@@ 5 years com@@ m@@ u@@ ting between D@@ en@@ mar@@ k and Sweden .
we have now ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red a b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ge between C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en and M@@ al@@ m@@ ö , and everyone ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ts a sh@@ ar@@ p increase in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order com@@ m@@ u@@ ting and for the two c@@ ities to become a con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation I@@ t was here that , in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 on the initiative of the D@@ an@@ es , the EU @-@ su@@ p@@ por@@ ted principle was in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed of ta@@ x@@ ing people in the country in which they work .
this means that people can take up re@@ si@@ d@@ ence in M@@ al@@ m@@ ö and have access to health c@@ are , ch@@ il@@ d c@@ are , education and e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , at the same time as pa@@ ying all their tax to the D@@ an@@ ish State .
that is quite in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ able if we are to have a common Ö@@ re@@ su@@ n@@ d region .
the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed by Swedish p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans is the O@@ E@@ C@@ D mo@@ de@@ l for frontier ta@@ x@@ ation , which ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ tes that tax should be le@@ v@@ i@@ ed in the country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence .
that principle too c@@ a@@ u@@ ses problems , however , because much more than f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies &apos; social w@@ el@@ f@@ are is fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed through tax .
for ourselves in the Ö@@ re@@ su@@ n@@ d region , it would in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact be best if we were to pa@@ y local tax where we li@@ ve and State tax where we work .
I think that would put an end to tax a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ance and to c@@ he@@ ating in frontier regions .
however , a mo@@ de@@ l such as that , too , would re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e some form of fin@@ e t@@ u@@ n@@ ing in order to c@@ re@@ ate an en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly f@@ a@@ i@@ r situation , for these are com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated issues .
it is therefore c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to be wor@@ k@@ ed out in the a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted regions themselves , and on the b@@ a@@ si@@ c principle that frontier workers must pa@@ y tax in the country in which they en@@ j@@ o@@ y their b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed through tax .
only in that way will long @-@ la@@ st@@ ing s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions be ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed .
it is essential to adopt a principle of this kind if Ö@@ re@@ su@@ n@@ d is to become a common region .
Mr President , as re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party , I would like to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d my he@@ ar@@ ty con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions to the to@@ w@@ n of P@@ i@@ ac@@ en@@ z@@ a , which has in@@ s@@ er@@ ted A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 2@@ 5 and 2@@ 6 of the European C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights of the el@@ d@@ er@@ ly and per@@ s@@ ons with dis@@ ab@@ il@@ ities into its own b@@ y@@ e @-@ la@@ ws . I would also like to com@@ ment on Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en &apos;s report .
I en@@ d@@ or@@ se the con@@ t@@ ent of the report , particularly the part which c@@ al@@ l@@ s for an an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the impact of ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to the la@@ ws of the Member States on R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 , re@@ la@@ ting to people who have wor@@ k@@ ed in more than one State , and especially that part of the regulation which concerns rules for the pa@@ y@@ ment of the pen@@ si@@ ons of people who have wor@@ k@@ ed in more than one State .
we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the problems of c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order workers : of course we re@@ f@@ er to European Union workers but also , in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , to relations between the States which have as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated themselves with R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 , that is with the E@@ E@@ A - the European E@@ con@@ om@@ ic A@@ re@@ a - in other words I@@ t@@ al@@ y and S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land .
I re@@ g@@ re@@ t to say that the I@@ t@@ al@@ y @-@ S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion and the en@@ su@@ ing regulation have been mis@@ in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted by the I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an Government , which has h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to pa@@ i@@ d the pen@@ si@@ ons of people who have wor@@ k@@ ed in both I@@ t@@ al@@ y and S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the sc@@ al@@ e of h@@ al@@ f of h@@ al@@ f the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t , that is a qu@@ ar@@ ter of the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t o@@ w@@ ed , as la@@ i@@ d down by I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an ma@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tes , j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es and c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
I call upon the European Parliament to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e to st@@ o@@ p workers being for@@ c@@ ed always to in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te legal pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s to ob@@ ta@@ in their rights .
Mr President , today we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the situation of frontier workers , a n@@ ag@@ g@@ ing problem for the European Union , which has yet to find a sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
Commissioner , Mr President , this situation pre@@ v@@ ents the people li@@ v@@ ing and working on the b@@ or@@ d@@ ers of the various European Union countries fully ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing the no@@ tion of European in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion we c@@ ha@@ m@@ p@@ ion , even though these are the people who should be the first to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from it .
we have a ha@@ b@@ it in this House of la@@ u@@ d@@ ing to the s@@ k@@ i@@ es the issue of free movement of per@@ s@@ ons and , h@@ ence , of workers .
yet , while there are still ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es to this , particularly in terms of tax and social security , there are also other matters to be con@@ si@@ de@@ red .
I believe that this issue is in@@ con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent with the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of freedom and li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ m which we are con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing , even though we se@@ e@@ m able to find per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly good s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to problems when it re@@ la@@ tes to the free movement of c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and of g@@ o@@ od@@ s .
this re@@ p@@ res@@ ents a major ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to the principle of the free movement of per@@ s@@ ons and the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al of non @-@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation on g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity .
in my opinion , this report is a real bo@@ o@@ st@@ er s@@ h@@ o@@ t in relation to pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous reports .
we should at least ensure that there is no need to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce many more reports .
we must re@@ mind the Member States of their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and ask them to under@@ take a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h evaluation of policies which result in u@@ p@@ h@@ ol@@ ding systems which have an ad@@ ver@@ se a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t on the situation of frontier workers .
we agree with the general th@@ r@@ u@@ st of the report but the re@@ in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ation of certain amendments w@@ a@@ ters down the a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons which we should be ad@@ op@@ ting .
b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , which , for example , re@@ la@@ te to tax or social security , should be per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent and it is simply not a matter of taking v@@ ar@@ ying pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons into account .
Mr President , I would like to su@@ m up by re@@ p@@ e@@ ating that an acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te in@@ v@@ ent@@ or@@ y should be proposed , l@@ is@@ t@@ ing s@@ it@@ u@@ ations g@@ i@@ v@@ ing r@@ ise to pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ice , or even dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation but also one which would make it possible to c@@ la@@ m@@ p down on the f@@ ra@@ u@@ d which o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ s at present .
we a@@ w@@ a@@ it the Council &apos; s gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es in this area .
Mr President , I should also like to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for her own @-@ initiative report .
I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the problems ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed by frontier workers .
I am f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with the problems from S@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n J@@ u@@ t@@ land , where it is wor@@ th no@@ ting how few people li@@ ve on one si@@ d@@ e of the D@@ an@@ ish @-@ G@@ er@@ m@@ an b@@ order and work on the other si@@ d@@ e . I think this il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes how major the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es in practice are .
that is why I think it is a good idea to t@@ r@@ y to get the Member States to con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally as@@ se@@ s@@ s the effects upon frontier workers w@@ h@@ en@@ ever they change tax and social security legislation . in my opinion , we cannot , however , re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e governments to com@@ pen@@ sa@@ te frontier workers fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally for ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in legislation .
it is better to he@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ en a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s not only of the problems there have always been , but also of new problems that might ar@@ ise .
I should also like to support the view that we should do more to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 . this is a very far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing problem , but one of great importance to many people .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make a few ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions following on from this d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er .
first of all , I would like to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en for the work she has done .
secondly , my contribution should of course be con@@ si@@ de@@ red as an ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Council and the Commission , but ma@@ in@@ ly the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Council , to do something about this d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er at long last , particularly in the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that this is the start of the necessary de@@ regulation of the movement of workers ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s Europe .
frontier work f@@ al@@ l@@ s under free movement , and will g@@ ro@@ w , especially once the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries have j@@ o@@ in@@ ed .
despite this , there are still major problems to con@@ t@@ end with .
especially in my own country and a number of n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing countries , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and G@@ er@@ many , I no@@ ti@@ ce that different groups wish to apply different pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es .
f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations involved with frontier workers ar@@ gu@@ e in favour of the principle of the country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence , trade uni@@ ons support the principle of the country of employment , the government itself b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es in the principle of the country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence , and so it g@@ o@@ es on .
it is about time we made a decision , and in that s@@ en@@ se , we are un@@ w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to support a number of amendments which Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en tabled , and which are par@@ tly de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to adopt a m@@ i@@ x@@ ed approach . we su@@ g@@ g@@ est using the principle of the country of employment as point of de@@ par@@ ture , and to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p this so @-@ called European social mo@@ de@@ l .
Mr President , I should like above all to thank the rapporteur for this report .
it is good that we should not for@@ get frontier workers and their problems .
the report is further e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence that R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 re@@ qu@@ i@@ res th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication , proposals for which have been before the Council for two years . we can , therefore , once again re@@ g@@ re@@ t the lack of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s in ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing more ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity v@@ o@@ ting at the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence in Nice .
the D@@ an@@ ish S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly agree with most of what the rapporteur sa@@ y@@ s , but I com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly and u@@ t@@ ter@@ ly dis@@ agree with her when she se@@ es it as a problem that ever more fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of national social in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce are fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed through public funds .
regulation 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 concerns the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation , and not the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation , of social security ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , and it is important to make this clear .
I should like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e this , because it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y this form of ar@@ gu@@ ment which has given an un@@ w@@ ar@@ r@@ an@@ ted bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to those D@@ an@@ ish op@@ p@@ on@@ ents of the EU who ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in that the EU is er@@ od@@ ing the D@@ an@@ ish w@@ el@@ f@@ are system .
it is par@@ tly those who or@@ g@@ an@@ ise res@@ is@@ t@@ ance to the EU who are pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ fully working to ensure that nothing at all ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s in this area .
they se@@ e@@ m to for@@ get that the Council &apos; s in@@ c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity for action does in fact have consequences - consequences for those people and their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies who work ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s national f@@ r@@ on@@ ti@@ ers and who are pla@@ gu@@ ed by un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y .
however , one further con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of the Council &apos; s in@@ c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity to ac@@ t is , in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , that it is the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans responsible , who take the decisions .
the E@@ u@@ ro@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ s t@@ al@@ k such a l@@ o@@ t about democracy , but it can n@@ e@@ v@@ er be d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c to om@@ it to take the necessary decisions and , in that way , to con@@ si@@ g@@ n people to in@@ security and to give the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts a de@@ g@@ re@@ e of in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence which p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to have .
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en on her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and , in particular , the social and f@@ is@@ c@@ al problems these workers f@@ ac@@ e .
I should also like to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission &apos;s proposal to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the sc@@ op@@ e of R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 to third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als , the proposal to m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ ise and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y that regulation , and for the en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing support given to the E@@ u@@ res n@@ et@@ work .
the Commission fully su@@ p@@ por@@ ts your concerns as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the problems en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ te@@ red by frontier workers .
I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council .
allow me to now set out b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly the Commission &apos;s approach to the points raised in the resolution .
first , on social security and the la@@ b@@ our market , the report c@@ al@@ l@@ s on the Commission , before the end of this year , to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise an international con@@ f@@ er@@ ence for the Member States and ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries concerning the position of frontier workers .
this is an excellent idea and ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge can be taken of the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted under the E@@ u@@ res n@@ et@@ work .
such a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence could i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy best p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es and initiatives that could be la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed both at Community and national level , and the European Parliament will be involved in its organisation .
on the idea of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons for su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y pen@@ si@@ ons , I would re@@ mind you that the Commission has com@@ m@@ it@@ ted itself in its social policy agenda to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 a directive on the trans@@ f@@ er@@ ability of su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y pen@@ si@@ ons .
this initiative will com@@ pl@@ ement the already ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing directive in this field , which was adopted in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
as the proposal will be based on A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 4@@ 2 of the E@@ C Treaty and re@@ ly on the c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on procedure for its ad@@ op@@ tion , Parliament will be fully involved .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more I can con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that a st@@ u@@ d@@ y co@@ ver@@ ing the ex@@ t@@ ent and nature of frontier work is already pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed to be carried out under the E@@ u@@ res a@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ es in 2001 .
on the initiatives taken by social security ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es for c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order cooperation in order to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate access to health @-@ c@@ are b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its , I am very much in favour of such initiatives and can con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that it is the in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of the Commission to encourage such initiatives and to promote ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ es of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence and best p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es .
in fact the Commission is already g@@ i@@ v@@ ing support to such a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of the E@@ u@@ re@@ g@@ i@@ o M@@ e@@ use @-@ R@@ h@@ ine , which co@@ ver@@ s part of B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , G@@ er@@ many and the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds .
with regard to the follow @-@ up of the D@@ ec@@ k@@ er and K@@ o@@ h@@ l j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments , there are important legal qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons currently being de@@ b@@ ated in new cases before the Court .
these qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons concern h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al c@@ are and the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch health system .
the Commission will a@@ w@@ a@@ it the ou@@ t@@ come of these j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments before taking a position .
on ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es to the mo@@ bility of st@@ ag@@ i@@ a@@ i@@ res , st@@ u@@ d@@ ents , v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ers , the Commission has already taken the initiative and p@@ res@@ en@@ ted a proposal for a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation of the European Parliament and the Council on mo@@ bility within the Community for st@@ u@@ d@@ ents , per@@ s@@ ons under@@ going training , young v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , te@@ ac@@ h@@ ers and tra@@ in@@ ers .
on 9 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 the E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation Council adopted its common position on this proposal .
I wish to thank Parliament for its support on this matter and I hope that the fin@@ al dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons will en@@ able Parliament and the Council to adopt the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations sh@@ or@@ tly .
on the idea of a proposal for a directive on the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of frontier effect reports , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by Member States would be re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to te@@ st their legislation as to the effects for frontier workers , I should make it clear that it is already the Commission &apos;s ta@@ s@@ k to ensure that all pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of national legislation are com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with the Treaty and the se@@ con@@ d@@ ary legislation of Community law .
the Commission will certainly continue to use the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers la@@ i@@ d down in A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 2@@ 6 of the Treaty and to la@@ un@@ ch in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ement pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s against Member States when they v@@ i@@ ol@@ ate Community law .
however , I understand that the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed proposal for a directive a@@ im@@ s to provide for a more general s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o @-@ economic impact as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the consequences of national legislation , that is in itself com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with Community law but might cause further di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es to frontier workers .
the Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e such a le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment .
it se@@ em@@ s to the Commission more appropriate to st@@ im@@ u@@ late c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order cooperation of the par@@ t@@ n@@ ers involved in the different regions and at Community level in order to pre@@ v@@ ent any n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve consequences of national legislation on frontier workers .
finally , my com@@ ments on tax .
un@@ like social security , there is no Community legislation at all on per@@ s@@ on@@ al ta@@ x@@ ation .
indeed Member States are extremely pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive of their s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty in this area .
that is particularly t@@ r@@ u@@ e of their com@@ p@@ et@@ ence to en@@ ter into b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l tax t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es .
therefore , there is little ch@@ ance of the Commission being able to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully the ad@@ op@@ tion of measures by Member States , as re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed in the report .
unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice .
as you are aware , con@@ t@@ r@@ ary to our common w@@ is@@ h@@ es , the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment of un@@ an@@ im@@ ity in Council was re@@ ta@@ in@@ ed for tax matters .
op@@ in@@ i@@ ons are , mo@@ re@@ over , l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to be di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed about the m@@ er@@ its of the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations made in the report concerning ta@@ x@@ ation in the State of employment .
in fact , the pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing view in tax ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tions is that the State of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence rather than the State of employment is best pla@@ c@@ ed to take account of the over@@ all situation of ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I wish to thank Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en again for her st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ ting report and to under@@ line the Commission &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in its efforts to over@@ come the problems f@@ ac@@ ed by frontier workers .
thank you Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the debate will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
environment directives
the next it@@ e@@ m is the or@@ al question ( B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 5@@ 5@@ 6 / 2000 ) by the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment , P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c H@@ e@@ al@@ th and C@@ on@@ su@@ m@@ er P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y to the Commission , on the p@@ o@@ or implementation of certain environmental directives ( P@@ C@@ B / P@@ C@@ T , ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s , n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes ) .
Mr President , Parliament &apos;s Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment is in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly concerned that we are ad@@ op@@ ting European environmental legislation and then n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ ting to implement it pro@@ per@@ ly .
pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing it b@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ tly , we believe that the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters , the Commission and the European Parliament are com@@ pl@@ ic@@ it in a dec@@ e@@ p@@ tion of the public .
opinion p@@ ol@@ l@@ s s@@ how that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of people support the idea that environmental issues are important and should be de@@ al@@ t with at European level .
we are ad@@ op@@ ting legislation that ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to f@@ il@@ l this need .
in fact , in all too many cases , environmental la@@ ws are i@@ g@@ no@@ red , ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s are not m@@ e@@ t , reports are not s@@ ent in to the Commission on time and those countries which b@@ re@@ a@@ k the law go un@@ pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of this debate is to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t what is going w@@ r@@ on@@ g and to t@@ r@@ y and do something about it .
the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment has put together three reports , we call them &apos; in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t reports &apos; , b@@ as@@ ing ourselves on the mo@@ de@@ l of the U@@ S C@@ on@@ g@@ res@@ s .
we have f@@ ou@@ n@@ d that the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive is l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed in con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ s@@ y and law su@@ its .
the P@@ C@@ B@@ s directive is ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised by the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e of Member States to su@@ p@@ p@@ ly the all @-@ important in@@ v@@ ent@@ or@@ ies of the st@@ o@@ c@@ ks they h@@ ol@@ d .
the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive was pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly f@@ la@@ w@@ ed from the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing and all but two countries , D@@ en@@ mar@@ k and Sweden of course , are now before the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice because of their f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to implement it .
it is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y that these sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s are re@@ p@@ e@@ ated throughout the c@@ an@@ on of EU environmental law .
what can be done about this ?
we hope firstly that in the environmental action programme , which the world is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing , the Commission will key in a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate resources for following up what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed to legislation .
it would be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to he@@ a@@ r from the Commissioner r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly how many people in her D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate are responsible for this as com@@ pa@@ red to those over@@ se@@ e@@ ing the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of new legislation .
there needs to be a much more h@@ on@@ est debate secondly - n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally and at the European level - about the real p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing the environmental objectives set out in d@@ ra@@ f@@ t legislation .
too often , we su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t , Member States si@@ g@@ n up to g@@ re@@ en la@@ ws because it l@@ o@@ o@@ ks good to do so , and op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing or m@@ od@@ er@@ ating them is seen as p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally in@@ s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve .
if , in fact , they cannot com@@ p@@ ly with what they have agreed to , such countries are doing G@@ re@@ en c@@ a@@ u@@ ses h@@ ar@@ m .
if the G@@ er@@ man@@ s and others , for example , now have t@@ r@@ ou@@ ble with the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive , why did we not he@@ a@@ r more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament ?
and did the G@@ er@@ m@@ an Government , in fact , vote against that directive or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ally ?
certainly the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of c@@ le@@ an @-@ up la@@ ws must be taken into account when a law is adopted .
a good example of the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to do this is the ur@@ b@@ an w@@ a@@ st@@ e w@@ a@@ ter directive which the government of B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s cannot a@@ f@@ for@@ d to com@@ p@@ ly with .
we su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t that the same th@@ ing will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en with the national em@@ is@@ si@@ ons c@@ e@@ il@@ ing directive .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we want Member States to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res which will allow them , all of them , to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out the monitoring work that must ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ y the pro@@ per implementation of many of the EU directives we adopt here .
my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es and I were d@@ e@@ s@@ per@@ a@@ te@@ ly dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted that the Council f@@ el@@ t it could not agree to our proposal to trans@@ form the environmental in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation into a directive .
we were not d@@ em@@ an@@ ding an EU in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate but simply that Member States should agree to bring their national in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ a@@ tes up to a common high st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d .
we will continue to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e this idea in two years time when the issue should re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to us .
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly , we want much qu@@ ic@@ k@@ er action by the Commission to take Member States to c@@ ou@@ r@@ t when they b@@ re@@ a@@ k EU law .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k the G@@ re@@ e@@ k Government , which can il@@ l a@@ f@@ for@@ d to do so , pa@@ i@@ d the second in@@ st@@ al@@ ment of a fin@@ e , now to@@ t@@ al@@ l@@ ing over EUR 2 million for f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to com@@ p@@ ly with a j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment of the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice over the d@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing of w@@ a@@ st@@ e in C@@ re@@ te .
this was th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years after the Commission received the first com@@ pla@@ in@@ t about the d@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing of that w@@ a@@ st@@ e and no less than n@@ in@@ e@@ te@@ en years after the directive concerned c@@ a@@ me into force .
it is ab@@ sur@@ d that a p@@ o@@ or country should get itself into a situation of pa@@ ying back money to B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s , but e@@ qu@@ ally ab@@ sur@@ d that the case should have taken so long .
finally , let me say that we in Parliament are not d@@ a@@ un@@ ted or di@@ ver@@ ted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the ad@@ op@@ tion of legislation and not with its follow @-@ up .
ap@@ par@@ ently the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment Council was s@@ om@@ e@@ what sur@@ pr@@ ised and even dis@@ ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ing that we had in@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ d@@ ed into their ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y and that our in@@ t@@ en@@ tion was to take the environmental in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation very s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
M@@ E@@ P@@ s , as we will all know , are on the rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing end of public c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of p@@ o@@ or implementation .
the public t@@ en@@ ds to com@@ pla@@ in to us , not to the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment Council .
in the interests of the people of Europe and their environment , we will pu@@ r@@ su@@ e this issue and we will not let go .
Mr President , first of all I thank Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on for her important question .
I would re@@ mind all the Members of the European Parliament that implementation of European Community law co@@ ver@@ s both the trans@@ position of directives into national law and their ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation to in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al decisions .
it also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ ment of other ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations such as ad@@ op@@ ting programmes , making de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ations and monitoring .
the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ te@@ red by the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment in these three reports are indeed not l@@ im@@ ited to the three directives ch@@ o@@ s@@ en but ex@@ t@@ en@@ d to all E@@ C environmental directives .
the Commission , and not least the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment D@@ G are aware of these di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es and have for some time de@@ voted efforts to improve their per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in this field and I can as@@ sure you that next w@@ e@@ e@@ k when the Commission dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ ses the S@@ i@@ x@@ th E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l A@@ c@@ tion P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me the whole implementation issue will be a very important point in that programme .
we have a number of to@@ ol@@ s at our dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ al to improve implementation .
we can , for example , dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate information to give a more up @-@ to @-@ d@@ ate p@@ ic@@ ture of the state of pla@@ y and I know that we have also for@@ w@@ ar@@ ded some of these reports and an@@ n@@ u@@ al sur@@ v@@ e@@ y@@ s to Parliament and that we can do much more to ensure some m@@ ed@@ i@@ a attention as well .
we can de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p to@@ ol@@ s to aid in the an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s and evaluation of progress in implementation .
we can take legal measures to follow up implementation .
since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 specific initiatives have been pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed on a number of f@@ r@@ on@@ ts including environmental li@@ ability , which of course will put p@@ res@@ sure on the Member States to follow the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing rules and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions ; com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations procedures at national level where we have been involved in pla@@ ying a con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ y role ; access to j@@ u@@ st@@ ice , ma@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tes &apos; training c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses - also very important because this is also about education - and the pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ation of this an@@ n@@ u@@ al sur@@ v@@ e@@ y on the implementation of environmental law .
we have also wor@@ k@@ ed to c@@ re@@ ate a clear l@@ in@@ k between implementation of the directives and Community co@@ funding which has pro@@ v@@ en to be very effective as well as en@@ sur@@ ing a c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the L@@ I@@ F@@ E financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment , because when they see that the money is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed if they do not com@@ p@@ ly with the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions this will defin@@ it@@ el@@ y put p@@ res@@ sure on the Member States .
in M@@ a@@ y last year we had a first n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise , as we call it , on b@@ a@@ th@@ ing w@@ a@@ ter quality .
a second ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise will take place in M@@ ar@@ ch this year and I will continue to follow this up so as to give us a s@@ co@@ re@@ bo@@ ar@@ d of how Member States are im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing Community legislation .
just last w@@ e@@ e@@ k the European Parliament and the Council , as Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on said , re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed an agreement on a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation which will establish min@@ im@@ u@@ m c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a for environmental in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions in the Member States .
all these initiatives are in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to increase the level of k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of and com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with European Community and environmental law .
of course , I ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that there is still much to be done .
we have to look for new w@@ a@@ y@@ s to encourage the pro@@ per trans@@ position and ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of environmental legislation .
for example , we need to work to improve the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of people at the local and regional level .
greater public a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s at these levels would le@@ a@@ d to c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y and to public d@@ em@@ and for effective implementation of environmental legislation .
we must re@@ main v@@ i@@ g@@ il@@ ant and ac@@ tive to ensure that the situation im@@ pro@@ v@@ es and I would like to con@@ f@@ ir@@ m to the European Parliament my per@@ s@@ on@@ al commitment and that of my services to en@@ sur@@ ing the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est possible level of com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with European Community environmental law .
to this end I will apply all means available , including the for@@ ma@@ l in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ement procedures set out in A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 2@@ 2@@ 6 and 2@@ 2@@ 8 of the European Community Treaty and 1@@ 4@@ 1 and 1@@ 4@@ 3 of the E@@ u@@ ra@@ to@@ m Treaty , which may le@@ a@@ d to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing economic pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es on non @-@ com@@ pl@@ ying Member States .
I would be more than ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve more resources and per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l from the European Parliament to work on this .
today we have about 4@@ 5 to 5@@ 0 st@@ a@@ f@@ f working full or part @-@ time on implementation , and , of course , we would need more than that .
but I also think that it is for every civil s@@ er@@ v@@ ant here to actually look at the implementation part of in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing new legislation .
I have been very clear from the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing that I will put more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on implementation .
that needs the three I &apos; s : information , in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion and implementation , which should be the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es for the future .
I hope that you will agree with me that we are st@@ ar@@ ting to make progress on im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing implementation and if both the Commission and the European Parliament continue their efforts to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the problem and ac@@ t on it , further progress will su@@ re@@ ly be made during this par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y term .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the field of the environment and public health , the main problem with the European le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive process is not its in@@ ability to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce appropriate legislation .
the problem li@@ es , on the one hand , in the s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ness with which directives are trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed into national law and , on the other , in sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s in their implementation .
the environmental directives that we are now de@@ b@@ ating , on P@@ C@@ B@@ s , n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes and ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s , are ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es of this very problem .
there is little point in our having ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the directive on ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s and the c@@ re@@ ation of the &quot; N@@ a@@ ture 2000 &quot; n@@ et@@ work in order to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t s@@ it@@ es of Community importance , when the Commission has been w@@ a@@ it@@ ing since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 for all the Member States to present a defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve l@@ is@@ t of these s@@ it@@ es , as well as their pl@@ ans , rules and management m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s .
the same problem ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the directive on P@@ C@@ B@@ s .
and there is little point in our having st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted the b@@ an on P@@ C@@ B@@ s and the dec@@ on@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of all e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing P@@ C@@ B@@ s and P@@ C@@ T@@ s with a view to pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting public health , if fi@@ ve years on , the over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of Member States have not only f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to implement the directive , but have also f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to take the most si@@ m@@ p@@ le action , which was to c@@ at@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e P@@ C@@ B@@ s and to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce pl@@ ans for dec@@ on@@ ta@@ min@@ ation .
we therefore have w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d non @-@ com@@ p@@ li@@ ance and for that reason , these directives have not pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed the environmental results h@@ op@@ ed for .
we also have a situation , however , in which a de@@ g@@ re@@ e of im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s .
the s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ness of the Community &apos;s legal pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses and the r@@ are use of financial pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es against those Member States that are s@@ l@@ o@@ w to com@@ p@@ ly have s@@ ent out two n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve political m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ g@@ es .
those States that do com@@ p@@ ly feel that there is no in@@ c@@ en@@ tive to continue and those that do not com@@ p@@ ly do not feel any p@@ res@@ sure to change their w@@ a@@ y@@ s .
it is therefore c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for the Commission , as G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an of the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es , to m@@ on@@ it@@ or the whole process of trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing and im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing Community law , pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ is@@ ing the commitment of all the Member States and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing that those States that do not com@@ p@@ ly will be pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed as an example .
Mr President , as Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on has so clearly il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ ted , the p@@ ic@@ ture which em@@ er@@ g@@ es from the an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the implementation of the three directives in question g@@ i@@ v@@ es g@@ en@@ u@@ ine cause for concern .
despite the fact that the measures di@@ f@@ f@@ er quite w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y , it ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of Member States have f@@ al@@ l@@ en a long way be@@ h@@ in@@ d s@@ ch@@ ed@@ u@@ le in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing them p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ ally .
and , quite a@@ part from the technical con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations specific to each of the three directives , this is a serious situation which must le@@ a@@ d us to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t on the reasons be@@ h@@ in@@ d it .
I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t two aspects of the issue : on the one hand , in our countries , protection of the environment is h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly ever con@@ si@@ de@@ red at the pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing stage of the various se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ al policies but con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to be v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed as a s@@ er@@ ies of actions to be carried out a p@@ o@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ or@@ i in order to re@@ pa@@ i@@ r d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge . on the other hand , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because of this re@@ t@@ ro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive approach , it is often f@@ el@@ t that the directives are too co@@ st@@ ly to implement and that it would not s@@ er@@ ve any real pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e to do so .
the er@@ ro@@ r li@@ es p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y in , when all is said and done , con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing environmental in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments to be an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation which has been im@@ p@@ o@@ sed , an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al c@@ o@@ s@@ t which s@@ er@@ v@@ es no pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e .
but the environment is our future and we cannot re@@ ly s@@ ol@@ el@@ y on v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers or fe@@ a@@ r of a s@@ ent@@ ence from the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t it .
I , too , am of the opinion that , since the F@@ i@@ f@@ th E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l A@@ c@@ tion P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me adopted a pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ally se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ al approach to environmental policy , it may be that , when dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the si@@ x@@ th , we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to place greater em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of social and economic pla@@ y@@ ers such as local authorities in the ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement of the objectives , so that the sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding of our environment in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly b@@ ec@@ om@@ es an el@@ ement to be in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into the over@@ all pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing stage .
in this context , it will be important , as we state in our motion for a resolution , to ensure ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tion of the best and wor@@ st results ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed by the Member States in the implementation of the environment directives . this could even take place v@@ i@@ a the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t and would under@@ line the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the commitment of each of the States in this matter and ex@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e their be@@ ha@@ v@@ i@@ our to public opinion , which is al@@ most always more effective than j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
in order to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the monitoring op@@ er@@ ation , but also com@@ par@@ is@@ on between the different s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , I feel that it is also even more important to continue to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch on common in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s in the field of the environment .
the protection of the environment c@@ ro@@ s@@ ses national b@@ or@@ d@@ ers and is a field of Community action pa@@ r ex@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ence .
it is also for this reason , and even more so in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the now im@@ min@@ ent enlargement to countries of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe , that we must not accept that the decisions adopted by ourselves and the 1@@ 5 governments should then be dis@@ re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded .
the natural world is a common le@@ g@@ ac@@ y , and our commitment to pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing g@@ o@@ als must s@@ er@@ ve as an example to the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries , who are in the th@@ ro@@ es of re@@ m@@ ed@@ ying often extremely serious in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents of de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation .
if this situation is to improve , each of us , as a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of Community , national or local institutions but also simply as a c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en , must do our part .
Mr President , my as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ant , V@@ i@@ k@@ k@@ i P@@ h@@ il@@ li@@ p@@ s , has just h@@ an@@ ded me a no@@ te which sa@@ y@@ s that D@@ en@@ mar@@ k s@@ pen@@ ds 1@@ 5 ti@@ m@@ es more than G@@ re@@ ec@@ e in c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out environmental in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions and making appropriate as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments .
well , if that is the case , then something is clearly very w@@ r@@ on@@ g , and I su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t it is not w@@ r@@ on@@ g with D@@ en@@ mar@@ k .
I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to support most of what the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment has said , although I have some t@@ re@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ation in doing so being con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ous that the next E@@ C@@ J fin@@ e may well be against the U@@ K for its f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to com@@ p@@ ly with the b@@ a@@ th@@ ing w@@ a@@ ter directive , despite the fact that a great deal of money has been s@@ p@@ ent and e@@ f@@ for@@ t made in recent years to re@@ ac@@ h such com@@ p@@ li@@ ance .
I want to make it clear , though , that I do not believe that we should be using the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e of some Member States to achieve com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with environmental legislation to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ en@@ ing our a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons or c@@ la@@ im@@ ing that too much legislation is im@@ p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al .
I am all for being re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c and for making sure that new legislation makes s@@ en@@ se but the problems we f@@ ac@@ e both throughout the European Union and ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the world are too great for us to l@@ o@@ w@@ er our si@@ g@@ h@@ ts .
and I think some of the progress made by the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive over the past year d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes very clearly that it is very often not the f@@ a@@ ul@@ t of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to b@@ la@@ me for the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er the g@@ o@@ od@@ s we all wish to see .
I want st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly to support the idea of a s@@ co@@ re@@ bo@@ ar@@ d which the Commissioner mentioned and of g@@ e@@ st@@ u@@ res to n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me those Member States which are f@@ a@@ il@@ ing to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of M@@ E@@ P@@ s , of the Commission and of the public .
as a p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an , the Commissioner k@@ no@@ ws very well the importance of making sure that that information is p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in a way which is e@@ a@@ si@@ ly di@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ble and under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d by every j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union and perhaps a few p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans as well .
so , let us call it the Commission &apos;s little red bo@@ o@@ k , no , let us call it the Commission &apos;s b@@ i@@ g g@@ re@@ en bo@@ o@@ k , al@@ be@@ it one with a few b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s on its pa@@ g@@ es .
let us n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me at every opportunity and bring the public al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e us in en@@ sur@@ ing that this environmental legislation is en@@ for@@ c@@ ed and that Member States rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
Mr President , Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on well ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed the concern of the members of the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment , which in my case is he@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ en@@ ed since I b@@ el@@ on@@ g to the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
for@@ ty per c@@ ent of the p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to this committee come from citizens concerned for the p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of the environment .
and they u@@ su@@ ally re@@ f@@ er to the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive , the environmental impact directive , the w@@ il@@ d b@@ ir@@ ds directive and the right to information directive , which together with those dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed here today on n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes and P@@ C@@ B@@ s are pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly the on@@ es most often in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ed .
Mr G@@ o@@ od@@ will &apos;s report s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that there are some Member States before the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts , others with pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s against them , and only two Member States that are above su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion .
Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t too , in his report , m@@ en@@ tions those Member States that have re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ed the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive .
the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons and I , m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , know that what often ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s is that Member States either do not res@@ p@@ on@@ d in time or , as we say in S@@ pa@@ in , and I do not know if there is a good trans@@ la@@ tion , they &quot; make the par@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ge di@@ z@@ z@@ y &quot; &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; t@@ r@@ y to dec@@ e@@ i@@ ve one &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
in addition , with the sc@@ ant human resources of the Committee members , who are always having to an@@ s@@ w@@ er the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds not only of the p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ers but also of the governments , it is very difficult to work , Commissioner .
it is essential that we respect the legislation that we ourselves draw up , and the pro@@ of that there is a lack of political will is that some Member States o@@ be@@ y it and others b@@ re@@ a@@ k it .
this can give com@@ p@@ an@@ ies a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve ed@@ ge .
in my opinion , there are three f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
first , something that has already been mentioned here : the de@@ ter@@ r@@ ent use of European F@@ un@@ ds ; European F@@ un@@ ds must not be given to projects that b@@ re@@ a@@ k Community law .
secondly , su@@ it@@ able pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es must be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d ; it is very h@@ ar@@ d ( I am from a region that b@@ ad@@ ly needs European su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es ) , but even if it is very h@@ ar@@ d to f@@ re@@ e@@ z@@ e certain su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es , if it is not done the Member States will not understand .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , Mr President , the process must be s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ ed up .
but I know that this li@@ es in the h@@ an@@ ds of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts , this li@@ es in the h@@ an@@ ds of the governments , this li@@ es in the h@@ an@@ ds of us all .
Mr President , the a@@ i@@ m of these directives is to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the environment .
this means that not only do the Member States trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e the directives into national legislation , they are also the on@@ es who actually implement this national legislation .
this also means that when monitoring implementation , it should not be the means to an end , but the end itself , which should be l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed at .
unfortunately , ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that Member States often f@@ a@@ i@@ l to implement European directives cor@@ rec@@ tly .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s , such as those de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to m@@ on@@ it@@ or com@@ p@@ li@@ ance in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ a@@ tes , are essential .
as far as the environmental in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions are concerned , the European Parliament has g@@ one to great l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ s to ensure that this is re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
however , n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations have not led to the en@@ ac@@ t@@ ment of a b@@ in@@ ding directive , because the Council and Commission do not want that at this stage .
given this att@@ it@@ u@@ de of the Member States , I fe@@ a@@ r that in future , problems will ar@@ ise at the implementation stage of other directives too .
we need only call to mind the many w@@ ar@@ n@@ in@@ g@@ s is@@ su@@ ed by the Commission to the Member States , which in some cases have led to in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ement procedures .
this can only get wor@@ se after enlargement , because the current Member States are se@@ t@@ t@@ ing the w@@ r@@ on@@ g example .
where there are di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion , the Commission should put forward amendment proposals for wor@@ k@@ a@@ ble rules .
these amendments are not in@@ t@@ en@@ ded for ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al or more far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing measures , but should help improve the wor@@ k@@ a@@ bility of the current rules .
as far as the P@@ C@@ B &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; p@@ ol@@ y@@ ch@@ l@@ or@@ in@@ ated b@@ i@@ p@@ h@@ en@@ o@@ l &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; directive is concerned , we should also t@@ u@@ r@@ n our attention to the su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ es .
if these are to be ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed for much longer , it will be a rather long time before this directive makes itself f@@ el@@ t .
Mr President , allow me to start by ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing with e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on and many of my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members have said and to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on a number of points .
as everyone has p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , we have the legislation .
the problem li@@ es in in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ating and ap@@ pl@@ ying this legislation .
of course , the political will must be there but it de@@ pen@@ ds ma@@ in@@ ly on the monitoring carried out by your o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , Commissioner .
if , for example , you rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve re@@ p@@ e@@ ated com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of de@@ al@@ ing with them through time @-@ con@@ su@@ m@@ ing cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d@@ ence , you should take a per@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent and dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve st@@ and and make sure the legislation really is im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
and if we have cause to go to the European Court , then let us do so and , if s@@ an@@ c@@ tions need to be im@@ p@@ o@@ sed , then we shall do that too .
as Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on has said , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e is already pa@@ ying EUR 20 000 a day and I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that G@@ re@@ ec@@ e will come to its s@@ en@@ ses and f@@ all into line .
I should particularly like to draw your attention to D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive 9@@ 2 / 4@@ 3 on N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a 2000 areas .
we should not allow projects to go a@@ he@@ a@@ d in these areas with a li@@ g@@ h@@ t he@@ ar@@ t , because A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 6 of the directive sa@@ y@@ s that only in the ab@@ s@@ ence of al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions should a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t be carried out for im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve reasons of over@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ing public interest in N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a 2000 areas .
and here again I would re@@ mind you that in an area of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , in the area of F@@ th@@ i@@ o@@ ti@@ d@@ a , where everyone is against b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ g@@ ing the M@@ al@@ i@@ a@@ k@@ o G@@ ul@@ f which , it should be no@@ ted the M@@ in@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ y of the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment and P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c W@@ or@@ ks itself in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a 2000 areas , your o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e has received com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about the G@@ re@@ e@@ k Government &apos;s in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to b@@ u@@ il@@ d this b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ge , which will have a h@@ u@@ ge environmental impact , even though al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions ex@@ is@@ t .
I shall be monitoring - and I welcome the un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king which you to@@ o@@ k in your in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion and I hope that it is a real un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king - what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s in all the areas in Europe which are N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a 2000 areas including , of course , the M@@ al@@ i@@ a@@ k@@ o G@@ ul@@ f , where there are pl@@ ans to b@@ u@@ il@@ d a b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ge which will w@@ i@@ p@@ e out an important ha@@ b@@ it@@ at .
Mr President , first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an and other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es for their words of w@@ is@@ d@@ o@@ m .
they are very positive and clear com@@ m@@ it@@ ments to do something about this very serious problem .
but it is not just words we need , it is actions , it is de@@ ed@@ s , and we cannot re@@ ly on Member States to do this al@@ one .
even if re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the Council were here , which they do not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be , even if they were pre@@ pa@@ red to make st@@ a@@ te@@ ments , which they do not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be , we would not be able to le@@ a@@ ve them to do it on their own .
we need some kind of w@@ at@@ c@@ h@@ d@@ o@@ g to m@@ on@@ it@@ or and ensure the implementation of legislation .
sa@@ d@@ ly our own E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment A@@ g@@ ency does not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be up to the j@@ o@@ b yet .
we can but hope .
so what s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions do we have ?
what can P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ans do ?
well , these three reports before Parliament today are a start .
they n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me .
they call for fin@@ es .
they make proposals for further im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement .
but , they also make a point which we must take on bo@@ ar@@ d here in Parliament .
they say e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally that b@@ a@@ d legislation should n@@ e@@ v@@ er have been put on the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te bo@@ o@@ k .
and that is a l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ on that we have to take to he@@ ar@@ t .
perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better .
we have t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about doing it but se@@ em@@ in@@ g@@ ly not done so yet .
when we put better legislation on the agenda in future , it has to be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted .
because of the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e of Member States to put into place legislation , t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally the P@@ C@@ B@@ s and P@@ C@@ T@@ s legislation , we now have the extremely serious problem of a long @-@ term con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of our food c@@ ha@@ in by a per@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent to@@ x@@ ic ch@@ em@@ ical .
that to@@ x@@ ic ch@@ em@@ ical is s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly but su@@ re@@ ly acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ting in the human food c@@ ha@@ in , re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing levels which are already be@@ y@@ on@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation levels in certain f@@ att@@ y su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally b@@ u@@ t@@ ter , and in some cases f@@ att@@ y f@@ ish , such as s@@ al@@ m@@ on .
they are now c@@ re@@ e@@ p@@ ing up the food c@@ ha@@ in to the point where our children are now st@@ ar@@ ting to in@@ g@@ est a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts of these to@@ x@@ in@@ s that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d those that are re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed by the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation .
if we are not pre@@ pa@@ red to take serious action pr@@ om@@ p@@ tly in future we will see further problems of this kind a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations .
we o@@ we it to those future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e this issue .
Mr President , I share the opinion of Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on and many other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who say that once legislation has been la@@ i@@ d down , it should be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
I also agree with Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on and her st@@ a@@ te@@ ment regarding the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive : &quot; that was f@@ la@@ w@@ ed from the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing . &quot;
it was p@@ o@@ or legislation .
how is it possible , if you want to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in 5@@ 0 m@@ il@@ li@@ gra@@ m@@ s of n@@ it@@ ra@@ te in g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ w@@ a@@ ter , to apply the same st@@ o@@ c@@ king d@@ en@@ s@@ ity per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e European Union , from F@@ in@@ land to I@@ t@@ al@@ y ?
n@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , the g@@ ro@@ w@@ th se@@ as@@ on in F@@ in@@ land is much sh@@ or@@ ter than in I@@ t@@ al@@ y , and so in I@@ t@@ al@@ y , as a general r@@ u@@ le , more c@@ att@@ le un@@ its per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e can be k@@ e@@ p@@ t than in F@@ in@@ land .
as far as I am concerned , every f@@ ar@@ m@@ er can have as many co@@ ws as he c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ ses , as long as he does not ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed the 5@@ 0 m@@ il@@ li@@ gra@@ m l@@ im@@ it .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now to m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ments , how it is possible that the Commission has not is@@ su@@ ed any clear gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es on how m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ments are to be taken , the de@@ p@@ th levels of these m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ments , the number of ti@@ m@@ es a year they should be taken , and how se@@ as@@ on@@ al in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ences can be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation ?
all these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s are still un@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ n and di@@ f@@ f@@ er con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly from country to country and se@@ as@@ on to se@@ as@@ on .
and if n@@ it@@ ra@@ te is m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red , how is it de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed that it or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ a@@ tes from an@@ i@@ ma@@ l man@@ ur@@ e al@@ one ?
a great number of farmers use ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al f@@ er@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ er ; how is that m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red ?
what is the impact of se@@ w@@ age le@@ a@@ ks , for example ?
what is the impact of major ri@@ ver@@ s dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing into other countries ?
an@@ i@@ ma@@ l man@@ ur@@ e cannot be the only cause of n@@ it@@ ra@@ te p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , and it is com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly un@@ re@@ as@@ on@@ able to te@@ l@@ l farmers to re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ t its use if we do not know the other c@@ a@@ u@@ ses .
I share the view of all the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who say that we must adopt s@@ ou@@ n@@ d environmental policy .
I do not dis@@ pu@@ te the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of 5@@ 0 m@@ il@@ li@@ gra@@ m@@ s of n@@ it@@ ra@@ te in g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ w@@ a@@ ter , but I do want clear gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es on how it should be m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red and how these m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ments should be carried out .
Mr President , I have w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en the report on the follow @-@ up to the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive and have , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed the clear im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that many Member States really did not ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate what com@@ m@@ it@@ ments they were taking on when they adopted the directive .
they did not ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate how far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing it really was .
this is one of the most important ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations for why progress has been so s@@ l@@ o@@ w .
however , the fact that progress has been s@@ l@@ o@@ w does not mean that nothing is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing .
in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , an in@@ c@@ re@@ di@@ ble a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing in this area , al@@ be@@ it not as much as we should like .
when the directive is called into question , it is important to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing is important , even if progress is s@@ l@@ o@@ w .
I also believe that this is an ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation for why in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent resources have been in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed in information and in dialogue with those di@@ rec@@ tly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by these pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted areas , something which also c@@ re@@ a@@ tes par@@ tly un@@ necessary con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in many areas .
I believe there is a l@@ o@@ t to be le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed from this .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , the Member States have pr@@ im@@ e responsibility , both fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally and le@@ g@@ ally , but , for the EU &apos; s part , it is important not only to le@@ g@@ is@@ late and to c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t funds - good though these ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly are - but also to pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ise the many good ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es there are and to use its own financial resources to encourage s@@ ou@@ n@@ d development .
the situation we have is in@@ c@@ re@@ di@@ b@@ ly serious , ma@@ in@@ ly because of the extremely ra@@ p@@ i@@ d im@@ p@@ o@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ment of b@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
n@@ or can we see a re@@ ver@@ sa@@ l of this t@@ r@@ end .
the work must therefore continue and , in the present situation , the directive ou@@ g@@ h@@ t not to be ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed or re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed .
Mr President , I very much welcome the fact that we as Parliament also f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l our monitoring com@@ p@@ et@@ ences and that we take a look at directives which m@@ e@@ e@@ t with a great deal of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m in the Member States .
not only do they m@@ e@@ e@@ t with a great deal of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m in the Member States , they also cause en@@ or@@ m@@ ous di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on in the European Parliament .
I would like to com@@ ment on two directives today .
these are the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive and the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive .
what do these two directives have in common ?
the fact that the Member States have been g@@ r@@ an@@ ted far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing p@@ o@@ w@@ ers to de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ate nature res@@ er@@ v@@ es , s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies to be pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted , and certainly as far as the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive is concerned , the s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve areas .
there are now an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing number of com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts from members of the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch L@@ o@@ w@@ er C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er of the States G@@ en@@ er@@ al who ask us what in G@@ o@@ d &apos; s n@@ a@@ me we have been up to .
however , it is not Europe which p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed that the whole of the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds should be de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ ted a n@@ it@@ ra@@ te @-@ s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve area .
it is the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds itself which dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to do so . it is then up to us , with the kind help of a number of M@@ E@@ P@@ s , to see how , by means of d@@ er@@ o@@ g@@ ation re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s , we can un@@ do the n@@ it@@ ra@@ te legislation , for example , in order to re@@ ac@@ h the g@@ o@@ al , this being a re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion in n@@ it@@ ra@@ te levels , in a dec@@ ent f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive .
today &apos; s tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y , a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ e between A@@ ac@@ h@@ en and M@@ a@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ h@@ t , has been b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to a st@@ an@@ d@@ still for the u@@ m@@ p@@ te@@ ent@@ h time because of two European ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers .
these ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers were s@@ p@@ ir@@ ited a@@ way by a c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n group for the protection and p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of this s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies who b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed that , if they ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted the ha@@ m@@ st@@ ers , they could get them to ma@@ te .
but for@@ c@@ ed ma@@ ting is something which does not work , even in the an@@ i@@ ma@@ l k@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m .
once again , for the u@@ m@@ p@@ te@@ ent@@ h time , the Council of State in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al s@@ it@@ e to a st@@ an@@ d@@ still .
however , having s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ ised the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive and having cor@@ rec@@ tly in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted the regulation on areas where p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red , we see that this m@@ e@@ a@@ sure was un@@ necessary .
what should ha@@ p@@ p@@ en now , and that is why I support the report on the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive , and most certainly the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive , is for the European Commission to make it quite clear - and perhaps la@@ y down in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing in clear D@@ u@@ t@@ ch l@@ an@@ gu@@ age - what is and is not possible .
we agree on the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , they are s@@ ou@@ n@@ d , but the way in which the Member States deal with them is dis@@ gra@@ c@@ e@@ ful by any st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d .
Mr President , p@@ o@@ or com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with environmental legislation is a h@@ u@@ ge problem .
as c@@ o @-@ le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ to@@ r , it is important for us to speak our min@@ ds , but we should not pa@@ s@@ s the b@@ la@@ me to the Member States too re@@ ad@@ il@@ y .
we must also consider the quality and nature of the legislation we pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce .
the Union is g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing ever b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ er and more di@@ ver@@ se .
we must therefore la@@ y down rules which can th@@ ri@@ ve in the different national c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res .
that is why I think we should p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ be less de@@ ta@@ i@@ l .
we must be very p@@ rec@@ ise in the results we want , but not in the way in which the results must be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
for that reason , I believe we should st@@ and by the result , a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m of 5@@ 0 m@@ il@@ li@@ gra@@ m@@ s , in the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive .
we do accept a certain de@@ g@@ re@@ e of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility with regard to the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d by which the result is ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
an example of s@@ ou@@ n@@ d legislation is the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive .
the environment is a common le@@ g@@ ac@@ y ; environmental protection a common ta@@ s@@ k .
it makes no s@@ en@@ se to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t b@@ ir@@ ds in one country if they are being s@@ h@@ o@@ t down ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the b@@ order in another country .
the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es a clear g@@ o@@ al .
the way in which it is to be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed is quite f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble .
the directive is not de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed , but pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a framework which al@@ l@@ o@@ ws la@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de for w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ing up local or regional interests , and that is ex@@ ac@@ tly how we need to mo@@ ve forward . as long as the result - c@@ ar@@ ing for the pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies and their ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s - re@@ ma@@ in@@ s par@@ a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t .
n@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , there are many con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es and pro@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ es with regard to the directive &apos; s ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation .
there are in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of in@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ t ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation .
it would be u@@ se@@ ful and necessary to provide clear information , but I am taken ab@@ ac@@ k by the large number of M@@ E@@ P@@ s who have re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed a re@@ view of the b@@ ir@@ d and ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive in order to work out in further de@@ ta@@ i@@ l certain con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ts in the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive .
the si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of this would then be com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion and major public interest .
the very st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th of the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive li@@ es in its f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility .
the directive st@@ an@@ ds for a m@@ od@@ er@@ n way of pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting the environment .
it is not about pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing up f@@ ences ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the environment , but about de@@ al@@ ing with the s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies and natural resources in a con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ ous m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , I re@@ g@@ re@@ t that some M@@ E@@ P@@ s are ad@@ ding to the c@@ ha@@ o@@ s by su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ing in an amendment that the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing infrastructure should dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r , or that major new projects are not v@@ i@@ able .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to find this to@@ p@@ i@@ c on the agenda today .
I would like to thank Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on for ra@@ is@@ ing the question .
although you re@@ f@@ er to three specific EU directives , I would point out that what we are t@@ al@@ king about here is a w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d problem with the trans@@ position of EU legislation in the Member States .
if you start from the principle that directives and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions are adopted by the Council and Parliament in the EU , then it is quite re@@ as@@ on@@ able to as@@ su@@ me that the Council - which does , after all , use these directives - will trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e them in the Member States acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
but what do we see ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing ?
two c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s are for@@ m@@ ing .
on one si@@ d@@ e there is the European Union , which se@@ e@@ ks to b@@ la@@ me the Member States for sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s .
on the other si@@ d@@ e , there are the Member States , which are more than w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to o@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ o@@ a@@ d their problems on@@ to the o@@ h @-@ so @-@ d@@ is@@ t@@ ant Europe , for@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing in the process that they are part of Europe themselves , and the Commission is p@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ y @-@ in @-@ the @-@ m@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le .
Commissioner , you have g@@ one to great l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ s to t@@ r@@ y and ensure that these la@@ ws are trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed in the European Union in a pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ ful m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
but it really is not that si@@ m@@ p@@ le and , of course , we have c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised your m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es .
I can understand to an ex@@ t@@ ent , why you to@@ o@@ k the line you did .
there are various reasons as to why countries have t@@ r@@ ou@@ ble trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing this legislation .
in my opinion , one of the reasons in the case of the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive is the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s , because one th@@ ing is for sure , it is not possible to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce n@@ it@@ ra@@ te levels as ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly as we d@@ em@@ and .
nature simply will not allow it .
however , in the case of the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive , Parliament h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted the sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s quite clearly last year , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that the directive was com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated and un@@ clear in par@@ ts and so it cannot be trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed in the Member States .
when we were in T@@ ou@@ l@@ ou@@ se , we sa@@ w how local people are t@@ r@@ ying to trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e it .
but b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally , they do not know what is going on .
they do not know where the b@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ar@@ ies are , or how to apply them pro@@ per@@ ly .
these are sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s that must be re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed as a matter of priority .
but it is also our responsibility to ensure that the directives are less u@@ to@@ p@@ i@@ an and far more re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c in nature .
Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on &apos;s question actually con@@ ta@@ in@@ s all the points we need to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s and there is nothing more to ad@@ d to it .
S@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ i@@ er s@@ an@@ c@@ tions and c@@ a@@ re@@ ful d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting of la@@ ws will en@@ able us to s@@ ol@@ ve this problem .
however , I would just like to point out that something needs to change in the Member States too , because the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment M@@ in@@ is@@ ters are , no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es too co@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ ly to promote the initiatives they adopt here , in their own countries , if this could le@@ a@@ d to conflict .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on and the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s for the three reports we are de@@ b@@ ating today .
effective implementation of the EU &apos; s environment directives in the Member States is n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally of great si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance in two w@@ a@@ y@@ s : firstly , in terms of environmental protection - which is , of course , the whole pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of the directives - but also in terms of our not c@@ a@@ using con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence to be l@@ o@@ s@@ t in EU le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive work through the Member States &apos; being able for a long time to get a@@ way with not im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the legislation which they themselves have h@@ el@@ p@@ ed bring about in the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters .
that is why I think that the three reports concerning the Member States &apos; f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to implement EU legislation are important .
the Council has , of course , been rather ir@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ ted about the fact that Parliament is l@@ o@@ o@@ king over its sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers , but I think that the work on the reports has re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed how s@@ la@@ c@@ k the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the Member States are about im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing EU legislation .
they have also re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed how s@@ l@@ o@@ w the Commission &apos; s and the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice &apos; s re@@ ac@@ tions are when it comes to in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate implementation .
we often , of course , he@@ a@@ r fin@@ e s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es about g@@ r@@ and European v@@ is@@ i@@ ons and the Europe of the future , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es from Members of this Parliament .
we also he@@ a@@ r this kind of th@@ ing from many governments , but it often , of course , dis@@ gu@@ is@@ es the fact that n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w national interests are being c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the common interests we have wor@@ k@@ ed for in the course of the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive work .
it is also in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to no@@ te that those countries which are often re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as rather re@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ t and c@@ r@@ it@@ ical in relation to certain aspects of EU cooperation are in re@@ al@@ ity those countries which com@@ p@@ ly best with EU decisions .
in all m@@ od@@ e@@ st@@ y , I am th@@ in@@ king , for example , of the N@@ or@@ di@@ c countries .
I was p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to he@@ a@@ r Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m &apos; s re@@ mar@@ ks on the reports .
I am sure that Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m has the will to ensure that the legislation is of a su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently high quality to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted and to ensure that it is e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed up .
I think , at any ra@@ te , that Parliament ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to provide as much support as possible for this work .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs J@@ ac@@ k@@ s@@ on &apos;s question il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the fact that the best la@@ ws in the world are no use w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever un@@ less they are ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly and , more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , pro@@ per@@ ly con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed .
for example , the Member States have not trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive into national legislation .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to a great deal of other legislation .
and this is legislation which we need for the future .
the Commission is responsible for trans@@ position and for ch@@ ec@@ king what s@@ or@@ t of on @-@ s@@ it@@ e con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s have been carried out .
in doing so it , in t@@ u@@ r@@ n , must re@@ ly on information su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ed to it by the Member States .
I get the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that monitoring is no e@@ as@@ y ta@@ s@@ k and if the Commission is to per@@ form this ta@@ s@@ k it needs information and d@@ at@@ a and reports to be s@@ ent in .
the com@@ pla@@ in@@ t was often v@@ o@@ ic@@ ed in the past that the Commission did not have enough st@@ a@@ f@@ f and resources to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate the d@@ at@@ a s@@ ent in for control pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses .
I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent resources .
mind you , Parliament cannot t@@ al@@ k , because we are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for reports .
I know that the Commission is very b@@ u@@ s@@ y rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing and pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing reports and that this s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es ti@@ es up Commission c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ities and resources un@@ n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y .
in other words , we all have to think where we can make im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents .
I think the Commission should re@@ ac@@ t more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , both towards the Member States and in in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ting the necessary pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s before the E@@ C@@ J and se@@ t@@ t@@ ing fin@@ es .
at the same time , I call on the Member States to h@@ on@@ our their ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations to trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e and control legislation and report to the Commission pro@@ per@@ ly .
I am the per@@ s@@ on responsible in our group for the w@@ a@@ ter framework directive and the rapporteur for the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ w@@ a@@ ter action programme , which is still pen@@ ding , and the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive is therefore a matter of particular concern to me .
on T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day , i@@ .@@ e@@ . t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , we shall be v@@ o@@ ting on the G@@ o@@ od@@ will report , to which I have proposed a number of amendments .
I should like to ask the House to accept these proposed amendments , because what we are t@@ r@@ ying to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility .
I should therefore be gra@@ te@@ ful for your support .
finally , I should like to m@@ en@@ tion one more point , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries .
we re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries to adopt European legislation .
but when the Member States themselves f@@ a@@ i@@ l to ab@@ i@@ d@@ e by it and the European Commission is un@@ able to take dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve action , then e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing st@@ ar@@ ts to go p@@ e@@ a@@ r @-@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed .
for this reason al@@ one and , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , in order to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t human health and the environment , all those responsible need to ra@@ d@@ ic@@ ally re@@ think the matter p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ ha@@ st@@ e and these reports make that clear .
Mr President , what a re@@ li@@ e@@ f that no s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er so far has called for the environmental directives to be w@@ a@@ te@@ red down .
Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t , it is nothing to with the p@@ o@@ or Member States not k@@ no@@ w@@ ing what they were l@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing themselves in for .
and right now they know full well that they are simply and d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly con@@ tra@@ v@@ en@@ ing European legislation .
they are st@@ al@@ l@@ ing for time and they know per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly well that nothing will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to them , because it ta@@ k@@ es so long for the Court to do an@@ y@@ th@@ ing .
what we have here is the d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ate f@@ l@@ ou@@ ting of European legislation and n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er Parliament n@@ or the Council should st@@ and for it .
some members are sa@@ ying that we should n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me .
I can n@@ a@@ me and s@@ ha@@ me m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f because A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a is one of the countries which has f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to com@@ p@@ ly with the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive , but I must also pro@@ te@@ st , Commissioner , because A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a has not been at all re@@ mis@@ s as far as the P@@ C@@ B directive is concerned .
we did e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing here which n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to be done even before there was a European directive .
we pa@@ s@@ sed a W@@ a@@ st@@ e L@@ a@@ w back in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 and an or@@ d@@ in@@ ance b@@ an@@ n@@ ing h@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ en@@ ated su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 .
we are being acc@@ used un@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly here .
as far as the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive is concerned , A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a has now rec@@ ti@@ fied its sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s , but we know only too well that the Member States had ter@@ ri@@ ble t@@ r@@ ou@@ ble trans@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing the n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directive .
the main problem here was that , because of the extremely high d@@ en@@ s@@ ity of li@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ k in many par@@ ts of the Union , k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing to within the l@@ im@@ it of 1@@ 7@@ 0 k@@ g of n@@ it@@ ro@@ g@@ en per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e of f@@ ar@@ m@@ land c@@ a@@ u@@ sed im@@ m@@ en@@ se di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es with the production of f@@ ar@@ m man@@ ur@@ e in se@@ ver@@ al countries .
perhaps such a high d@@ en@@ s@@ ity of li@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ k will be less of a problem in the future , because co@@ ws , those pa@@ in@@ ed and t@@ or@@ m@@ en@@ ted c@@ re@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res , are fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting back .
the form of B@@ S@@ E which currently con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ts us may well be a s@@ or@@ t of re@@ v@@ en@@ ge on the part of these t@@ or@@ m@@ en@@ ted an@@ im@@ als .
we should take a l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ on from nature and con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t ourselves pro@@ per@@ ly and com@@ p@@ ly with the la@@ ws which we ourselves have pa@@ s@@ sed .
Mr President , I should like again to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their st@@ a@@ te@@ ments .
I could not agree more with most of what you have said , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t for any acc@@ u@@ sa@@ tion of com@@ pla@@ c@@ ency .
may I re@@ mind you that , as of today , 4@@ 5 % of all the com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts are on environmental issues and cases - 7@@ 00 com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts , 3@@ 0 % of the in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ em@@ ents - about 4@@ 00 - are on environmental cases .
so there is a he@@ a@@ v@@ y b@@ ur@@ d@@ en on us and we are t@@ r@@ ying to do our best but also look to the future .
that is why I am sa@@ ying that we also have to look out for new in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments and w@@ a@@ y@@ s to do more .
Mr S@@ ac@@ con@@ i &apos;s point was that we need the good ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es of what economic g@@ a@@ in@@ s can be made from com@@ pl@@ ying with environmental legislation .
we could do more on that .
we could do more with the use of in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s because we have to m@@ e@@ a@@ sure .
we have to be better at as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the results of com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with environmental legislation .
we are most effective when we have a good and effective in@@ ter@@ pla@@ y between the institutions , while not d@@ en@@ ying the fact that Member States are responsible .
they have to give us an@@ s@@ w@@ ers and provide us with information .
we do not have the means to s@@ en@@ d people to all the Member States to ch@@ ec@@ k .
we cannot do that un@@ less you give me another 5@@ 00 people .
what we have to do is m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ ise legislation .
it has been said that we need less but better le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals .
I agree with that .
the e@@ a@@ si@@ est way is the l@@ im@@ it @-@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e approach , to say 5@@ 0 m@@ g@@ s of n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes for example in d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter .
but this cannot apply in other far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing directives of a b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er sc@@ op@@ e , such as the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive .
it is no co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ence that the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s and n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes directives are ch@@ o@@ s@@ en as ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es of b@@ a@@ d com@@ p@@ li@@ ance because they are very far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing .
they are a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous directives and in some cases it means the Member States need to re@@ view fully their agricultural p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es .
we know this from some of the Member States .
this should not be taken as an ex@@ c@@ use , but an ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of why these directives are c@@ ited for lack of implementation .
I to@@ t@@ ally agree with Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t that it is not because these directives are not good or a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous enough .
they are far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing and there are consequences for the Member States which they perhaps did not re@@ al@@ ise when the decisions were taken .
we must not give in now , we have to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on because we will finally start to see results .
what we have done , which is very effective , is to establish the l@@ in@@ k between European funding and com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with environment legislation .
we have to draw on that .
we can do more on education and information .
we have st@@ ar@@ ted ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities like this .
we use our ex@@ per@@ ts to go to Member States or to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out se@@ min@@ ar@@ s to te@@ ac@@ h the Member States how to best implement it .
we t@@ r@@ y to use all these available in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments to improve implementation .
in an en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed and more di@@ ver@@ se Union , clear and le@@ g@@ ally b@@ in@@ ding ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s , as well as education and m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s for m@@ e@@ a@@ sur@@ ing , monitoring and c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ting results , become more and more important .
I hope for the European Parliament &apos;s support and b@@ ac@@ king in our further at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to improve the implementation of our European Community environmental legislation .
I have received a motion for a resolution in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with R@@ u@@ le 4@@ 2 ( 5 ) of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day , at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
young farmers in the Union
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 7 / 2000 ) tabled by Mr P@@ ar@@ ish , on behalf of the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment , on the situation and per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ es of young farmers in the European Union &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 2000 / 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 1 ( I@@ N@@ I ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , ladies and gentlemen , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to be able to present to you today the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment &apos; s own @-@ initiative report on the situation and per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ es of young farmers in the European Union .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago , I , m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , was a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of my local young farmers &apos; organisation in the c@@ ou@@ n@@ ty of S@@ om@@ er@@ set in E@@ n@@ g@@ land .
even in those d@@ a@@ y@@ s it was not e@@ as@@ y for young farmers to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on the family f@@ ar@@ m or get st@@ ar@@ ted in the industry .
today the situation has become even more difficult , and we are w@@ it@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing a b@@ i@@ g d@@ ro@@ p in the number of young farmers com@@ ing into the industry .
we have re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed a point where it has become v@@ it@@ al to take action in order to st@@ o@@ p this dec@@ line .
not only for the sa@@ k@@ e of ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture itself , but also to sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res in our c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
the last th@@ ing that we want to see is a de@@ p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e where the g@@ re@@ en and p@@ le@@ as@@ ant l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e which we take for g@@ r@@ an@@ ted will not be l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed after pro@@ per@@ ly any longer .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation C@@ E@@ J@@ A for its help and cooperation in en@@ ab@@ ling me to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce this report .
I was given the opportunity to v@@ is@@ it young farmers in fi@@ ve Member States which g@@ a@@ ve me a better and w@@ i@@ d@@ er under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al w@@ a@@ y@@ s in which young farmers could be h@@ el@@ p@@ ed in the industry .
I would further like to thank Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er for his b@@ ac@@ king and I would also welcome the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t opinion on the report pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by the Committee of the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ons because it is going to do a report on young farmers .
last but not least , I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my th@@ an@@ ks to R@@ o@@ s@@ s G@@ or@@ d@@ on C@@ on@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ ts who pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed an excellent st@@ u@@ d@@ y on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ation has been of great help in pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing today &apos;s report .
the report pu@@ ts forward a s@@ er@@ ies of i@@ d@@ e@@ as and w@@ a@@ y@@ s of as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing young farmers st@@ ar@@ ting up or c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying on in their b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
I have , however , t@@ ri@@ ed not to re@@ in@@ v@@ ent the w@@ h@@ e@@ e@@ l .
b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally I would like to see the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union .
I am fully aware that it is not an e@@ as@@ y ta@@ s@@ k to come up with one s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion co@@ ver@@ ing all the different conditions f@@ ac@@ ing young farmers in their res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive countries in a Community of 1@@ 5 Member States .
to n@@ a@@ me just two ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es : land v@@ al@@ u@@ es can v@@ ar@@ y from EUR 1@@ 2 000 per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e to EUR 1@@ 5 000 per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e .
levels of ta@@ x@@ ation v@@ ar@@ y g@@ re@@ at@@ ly with some Member States im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able in@@ h@@ er@@ it@@ ance tax which r@@ en@@ d@@ ers the sur@@ v@@ i@@ va@@ l of young farmers very difficult , especially where land v@@ al@@ u@@ es are very high .
I do not have the time to go through all the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations made in the report , but I will l@@ is@@ t some of the measures which should be given priority : the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of start @-@ up g@@ r@@ an@@ ts of up to EUR 4@@ 0 000 , in com@@ b@@ in@@ ation with su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised interest ra@@ tes for start @-@ up c@@ ap@@ it@@ al of up to EUR 1@@ 20 000 for e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t years .
two of the major di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ te@@ red by young farmers are the ra@@ is@@ ing of start @-@ up c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently the d@@ an@@ g@@ er of over@@ st@@ re@@ t@@ ch@@ ing their financial ab@@ il@@ ities by pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing re@@ gu@@ la@@ r interest pa@@ y@@ ments .
we are li@@ v@@ ing in a com@@ pu@@ ter age .
access to education and training needs to be further en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged in order to allow young farmers to take full ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ es o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by m@@ od@@ er@@ n com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s op@@ er@@ ation te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es .
the ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing f@@ ac@@ e of ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al W@@ T@@ O ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , means that ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture will continue to change .
it is in our best interests that young farmers are well pre@@ pa@@ red to an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate and to man@@ age these future ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es .
food safety measures and production m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s are being th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly an@@ al@@ y@@ sed these d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
there is greater em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on or@@ g@@ an@@ ic production throughout Europe .
here again , young farmers must be pla@@ c@@ ed in a position which will allow them to em@@ b@@ ra@@ ce a new u@@ p@@ com@@ ing c@@ ul@@ ture and to be aware of the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing con@@ su@@ m@@ er con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence and support for agricultural products .
there is t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ous sc@@ op@@ e for in@@ no@@ va@@ tive and c@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ ve local high @-@ quality production .
the European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic per@@ i@@ o@@ d with a great deal of re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing going on at the same time .
there is a great need to as@@ s@@ is@@ t some of the ol@@ d@@ er farmers to re@@ ti@@ r@@ e in di@@ g@@ n@@ ity .
in this context , I would very much like see a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge for ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing farmers l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing in young farmers to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on the industry .
I would like to ask Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er to re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d to Member States that they in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce such a policy throughout the EU .
we are se@@ e@@ ing the a@@ ver@@ age age of the farming Community increase with f@@ al@@ l@@ ing n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of young farmers .
this t@@ r@@ end must be re@@ ver@@ sed .
young farmers need greater access to production rights .
it is not e@@ as@@ y to b@@ al@@ ance the d@@ el@@ i@@ very of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken a@@ way from ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing farmers who themselves are already f@@ ac@@ ing financial di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
when , in future , production rights are ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed , I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of ex@@ t@@ r@@ a production which is given to young farmers .
with the em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s in the C@@ A@@ P on g@@ i@@ v@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing importance to rural development s@@ ch@@ em@@ es , it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the young farmers as the key pla@@ y@@ ers and main ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ v@@ es responsible for the implementation of such new rural re@@ development policies .
with the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing enlargement of the European Union , I would st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly ad@@ v@@ ise the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant Member States to start c@@ re@@ ating su@@ p@@ por@@ tive measures for their young farmers already at present , especially in view of the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of production con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s re@@ qu@@ i@@ red by the Commission .
in many par@@ ts of the world , share farming is a common practice .
I would like to ask the Commission to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities for de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing share farming within the common agricultural policy .
as I have already mentioned , this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , and I hope all parties will be able to si@@ g@@ n up for this report and make sure positive p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al help is given young farmers in the future .
I would also like to thank Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er once more for his support and also ask h@@ i@@ m to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce an a@@ u@@ d@@ it to be carried out every two years on the a@@ va@@ il@@ ability and su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of measures put in place to support young farmers .
it is very important that we do not just pa@@ y great li@@ p s@@ er@@ v@@ ice to h@@ el@@ p@@ ing young farmers , but actually d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er policies within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers com@@ ing into the industry .
Mr President , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , I wish , first of all , to congratulate the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and , in particular its rapporteur , Mr P@@ ar@@ ish , on the ti@@ m@@ el@@ y initiative to bring the debate on this issue to the European institutions .
it is 3@@ 2 years since S@@ ic@@ c@@ o M@@ an@@ sh@@ ol@@ t , the Commissioner responsible for ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture from the time the Commission was for@@ m@@ ed until 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 2 , p@@ res@@ en@@ ted his d@@ ra@@ f@@ t reform of the common agricultural policy , the M@@ an@@ sh@@ ol@@ t P@@ l@@ an .
it is my view that the European institutions have not pa@@ i@@ d su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to this great fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e in European p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s .
I still re@@ a@@ d this c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ c work today and I still find that it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s many of the an@@ s@@ w@@ ers we need to the problems f@@ ac@@ ed by young farmers , which are acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te@@ ly d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed in Mr P@@ ar@@ ish &apos; s report .
we have c@@ re@@ ated a major common policy based on support pa@@ y@@ ments per h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e , per an@@ i@@ ma@@ l or even acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to production ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed ; we have l@@ im@@ ited production rights and e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed quotas ; we have im@@ p@@ o@@ sed com@@ p@@ le@@ x m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s for st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ing production and we have c@@ re@@ ated in@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ate systems in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ing in international mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
the results have been v@@ ar@@ i@@ ed , with some positive aspects but with many other n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve aspects .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the la@@ t@@ ter , I would h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the effect this policy has had in c@@ re@@ ating major problems for young people w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to establish themselves in farming .
the b@@ ol@@ d st@@ u@@ d@@ y d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up on this issue by Parliament con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ s that land is still the major in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment for European farmers .
the st@@ u@@ d@@ y also s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty of access to land to be the main problem f@@ ac@@ ing young farmers .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to this st@@ u@@ d@@ y , for each per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge point increase in su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es for w@@ h@@ e@@ at c@@ ro@@ p@@ s , the pr@@ ice of land g@@ o@@ es up by 0@@ .@@ 4 % .
this effect is si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fied by qu@@ o@@ t@@ a systems and by production @-@ l@@ im@@ it@@ ing s@@ ch@@ em@@ es .
we cannot , therefore , con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late the need to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t and support the m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ is@@ ation and re@@ in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ation of ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture un@@ less we consider ch@@ an@@ g@@ es that could be made to the current C@@ A@@ P .
the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to this mo@@ de@@ l of agricultural policy will n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a policy f@@ o@@ c@@ used on farmers and their in@@ comes and not on the pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , the land or the li@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ k by means of which the in@@ come is ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed .
it will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e an agricultural policy that is defin@@ ed in regional rather than se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ al terms and will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e priority for the environment , rural development , v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al training and e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , I should like to su@@ g@@ g@@ est to Mr P@@ ar@@ ish and to the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment that this report should not be seen as a fin@@ is@@ h@@ ing line but rather as a point of de@@ par@@ ture for a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h st@@ u@@ d@@ y into over@@ ha@@ ul@@ ing ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and re@@ for@@ m@@ ing the common agricultural policy with the specific participation of young farmers &apos; as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations .
R@@ e@@ v@@ is@@ it@@ ing the M@@ an@@ sh@@ ol@@ t P@@ l@@ an would be a good place to start .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts I would like to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d my s@@ in@@ c@@ er@@ e th@@ an@@ ks to the rapporteur for his excellent work .
many th@@ an@@ ks indeed go to h@@ i@@ m , then .
in this sh@@ or@@ t s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h I would like to f@@ o@@ c@@ us attention on a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of points .
the report ta@@ k@@ es excellent account of the problems of young farmers . social problems are de@@ al@@ t with particularly well .
this is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , because it is young men who are mo@@ st@@ ly k@@ e@@ en@@ er to continue farming than young women are .
the problem that has come about is what is re@@ f@@ er@@ red to as the h@@ un@@ d@@ red @-@ h@@ ec@@ ta@@ r@@ e s@@ ol@@ it@@ u@@ de f@@ ac@@ to@@ r .
in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture we need su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability , especially with regard to change @-@ of @-@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ation f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s .
the a@@ ver@@ age age of European farmers is wor@@ r@@ y@@ in@@ g@@ ly high .
it must be fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble to su@@ st@@ a@@ in the change @-@ of @-@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ation system .
young people must be in@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed to start farming .
there are not enough young st@@ ar@@ ters , however .
it would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion that is important to us all .
young farmers are very s@@ k@@ il@@ led and are not pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ ed about using m@@ od@@ er@@ n te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y in their work in the fi@@ el@@ ds and in re@@ ar@@ ing c@@ att@@ le .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , they can make use of the la@@ te@@ st information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y in their pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing .
we are on the th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d of great change , which the rapporteur b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to our attention here , and it is the young , if an@@ y@@ one , who are best e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed to le@@ a@@ d us through this re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , which we will in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly have to f@@ ac@@ e within a few years .
the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons and measures proposed in the report are l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y matters that have to be dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed upon n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally , and this is good for f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility .
the EU can and must promote policies that work as in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es for the young .
b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y must not become a b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er to im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the position of young farmers .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I should like to give Mr P@@ ar@@ ish my th@@ an@@ ks , con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions and support for his report .
in these ti@@ m@@ es when the y@@ ou@@ n@@ g@@ er g@@ en@@ er@@ ation can see that the quality of life is no longer c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ation and c@@ ities and large com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al c@@ ent@@ res , we have the ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation in the Union to encourage and help the y@@ ou@@ n@@ g@@ er g@@ en@@ er@@ ation to take over from the ol@@ d@@ er so that the c@@ y@@ c@@ le of life and people in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture may be com@@ p@@ le@@ ted by means of new Community initiatives that have the young f@@ ar@@ m@@ er as their priority objective .
we must put into practice the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es and actions proposed in this own @-@ initiative report so as to make rural life more att@@ ra@@ c@@ tive to young people , th@@ us pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing de@@ population of the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
this social group is the future basis of the C@@ om@@ m@@ on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y ; we have to increase in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion a@@ i@@ d@@ s and su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment g@@ r@@ an@@ ts for this group , particularly in those st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally less @-@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red areas where ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s and d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ted v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es are common , where young people can re@@ v@@ i@@ ve the rural ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
all this will be th@@ an@@ ks to the development of new products of regional interest , such as ag@@ r@@ o @-@ t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m and rural t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , or through re@@ p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ting these natural s@@ pa@@ c@@ es with an@@ i@@ ma@@ l and pl@@ ant s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies , con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting to the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able and la@@ st@@ ing development of the area .
Mr President , the first part of the motion for a resolution in the report re@@ p@@ e@@ at@@ s the now f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s on the p@@ o@@ or situation and pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of young farmers in the European Union .
however , no m@@ en@@ tion is made of why this should be so , given that the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous two Community support s@@ ch@@ em@@ es pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted two programmes for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of young farmers , which the European Union va@@ un@@ ted as a p@@ an@@ ac@@ e@@ a which would s@@ ol@@ ve all the problems f@@ ac@@ ed by young farmers and re@@ ver@@ se the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve t@@ r@@ end .
this con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ous om@@ is@@ sion r@@ un@@ s throughout the resolution , which f@@ a@@ il@@ s to m@@ en@@ tion three b@@ a@@ si@@ c f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s which , un@@ less they are de@@ al@@ t with , will r@@ en@@ d@@ er the third Community programme for young farmers e@@ qu@@ ally in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ u@@ al .
these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s are , first , that the C@@ A@@ P , especially in its p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 2 form and following A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , does not sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d a v@@ i@@ able in@@ come for most small or m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed farming h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , or a sur@@ v@@ i@@ va@@ l in@@ come for the he@@ ad@@ s of these h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , which is why no one w@@ an@@ ts to in@@ v@@ est an@@ y@@ th@@ ing at all in the farming sector , however many g@@ r@@ an@@ ts there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it un@@ prof@@ it@@ able , it does not even a@@ f@@ for@@ d a b@@ a@@ si@@ c in@@ come .
secondly , there is u@@ su@@ ally no@@ b@@ od@@ y to apply the in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es to ; in other words , because of the quotas , young farmers have no reason to work , given that the quotas have been used up for all the products and they must w@@ a@@ it for a national st@@ o@@ c@@ k to be c@@ re@@ ated and d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted to young farmers or b@@ u@@ y quotas , in which case , good l@@ u@@ c@@ k to them .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , however high the in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es , the terms and conditions are such that they are more su@@ ited to large farmers and ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed farmers .
the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment for very large c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ted areas , even in is@@ land regions , is a t@@ y@@ p@@ ical example .
this re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment b@@ ec@@ om@@ es pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ve when com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with quotas .
in other words , the Community re@@ qu@@ i@@ res young farmers to have a large f@@ ar@@ m and large @-@ sc@@ al@@ e production , but n@@ i@@ g@@ h pre@@ v@@ ents them from pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing an@@ y@@ th@@ ing with the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system .
this in@@ con@@ g@@ r@@ u@@ ous situation is not , in my view , an in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent , r@@ an@@ d@@ o@@ m c@@ h@@ o@@ ice by the European Union .
it is d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ate policy , the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e being to r@@ u@@ in p@@ o@@ or , m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed farmers and support large f@@ ar@@ m@@ s or rather large com@@ p@@ an@@ ies in the agricultural sector .
that is why we cannot vote in favour of this report ; it is because it con@@ c@@ e@@ als the real reasons .
even these g@@ r@@ an@@ ts , when they are given to p@@ o@@ or , m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed farmers , are m@@ e@@ ted out in d@@ ri@@ p@@ s and d@@ ra@@ b@@ s and G@@ re@@ ec@@ e is a t@@ y@@ p@@ ical example here .
I do not know , for example , if Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er is aware of the fact that our g@@ r@@ an@@ ts for young farmers have still not been received , despite the fact that the government used this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of ar@@ gu@@ ment to sa@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ tion point in order to w@@ in v@@ o@@ tes last A@@ p@@ ri@@ l .
Mr President , I want to com@@ m@@ en@@ ce by com@@ pl@@ im@@ ent@@ ing the rapporteur on his very well @-@ re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ed and objective report which I and my group have no di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in su@@ p@@ por@@ ting .
in the context of A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , very c@@ re@@ di@@ ble efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion in European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
a r@@ e @-@ va@@ m@@ p@@ ed f@@ ar@@ m re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion aid and other measures may not , however , achieve our de@@ si@@ red objective and in my view the problem must be re@@ v@@ is@@ ited as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ency , o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ity of family farming will be put at serious r@@ is@@ k .
a@@ part from the s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly u@@ p@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ ing and de@@ va@@ st@@ ating consequences of B@@ S@@ E , which I believe will be over@@ come , the real problem for young people who in n@@ or@@ ma@@ l c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es would take up farming as a c@@ a@@ re@@ er is the a@@ va@@ il@@ ability , welcome though it is , of al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve and certainly more fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally re@@ w@@ ar@@ ding employment .
farmers and non @-@ farmers must f@@ ac@@ e this re@@ al@@ ity and do so before it is too late .
farming as a prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion has the on@@ er@@ ous responsibility of gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing our citizens food security and quality , and we must ac@@ t to sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive b@@ a@@ se of European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture by en@@ sur@@ ing that young people with the e@@ th@@ o@@ s of farming in their b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d are ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ a@@ te@@ ly en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged and com@@ pen@@ sa@@ ted .
I re@@ al@@ ise that many small f@@ ar@@ m@@ s do not have the c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity to g@@ en@@ er@@ ate su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent in@@ come for their o@@ w@@ n@@ ers because of sc@@ al@@ e and en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
I believe we must do more to as@@ s@@ is@@ t those in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in a re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing programme - and the rapporteur made re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to it in his report - through the p@@ o@@ ol@@ ing of land and human resources , which would le@@ a@@ d to greater e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise , the opportunity of rural development and new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y in terms of c@@ re@@ ating f@@ ar@@ m and part @-@ time employment for both women and men must , in every case , be v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ou@@ s@@ ly pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when we re@@ al@@ ise that 5@@ 5 % of European farmers are over 5@@ 5 years ol@@ d and only 2@@ 3 % are less than 4@@ 4 years ol@@ d , we must in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de that the future of farming in the European Union is under th@@ re@@ at .
the situation is even more serious in my own country , where these fi@@ gu@@ res are 6@@ 6 % and 1@@ 5 % res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
in the m@@ i@@ d @-@ 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the C@@ A@@ P be@@ g@@ an ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing in order to improve measures for di@@ rec@@ t control of production with the a@@ i@@ m of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ ses and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing the st@@ ability of pr@@ ic@@ es and in@@ comes .
however , the other si@@ d@@ e of the co@@ in as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds op@@ ting for st@@ ability in this way has been less f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility in access to farming , which particularly pen@@ al@@ is@@ es young farmers , first of all because of the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in g@@ a@@ in@@ ing access to quotas , production or pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m rights .
secondly , young farmers are pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed as a result of in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s in land pr@@ ic@@ es due to the increase in v@@ al@@ u@@ e c@@ re@@ ated by the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a systems . f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , it is well k@@ no@@ w@@ n that many Member States have not im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted measures that in any way ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the concerns of young farmers .
I shall give the example of my own country where , after an in@@ it@@ i@@ al p@@ ha@@ se of en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m when we j@@ o@@ in@@ ed the EU , in recent years we have become more sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ al and the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the organisations most re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of young farmers have even been pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed .
the Commission must now ur@@ g@@ ently ta@@ ble proposals for measures for action and the Council must adopt them .
un@@ less this ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s , we will be taking an ir@@ responsible att@@ it@@ u@@ de that will put the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ity of farming in Europe , with all that this means for our c@@ ul@@ ture , at r@@ is@@ k .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , I wish to thank N@@ e@@ i@@ l P@@ ar@@ ish for his ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding work on this report .
Mr President , the report de@@ als with a most difficult subject : the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for young people in the farming industry , as the rapporteur has in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated , are pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly wor@@ se than at any time since the c@@ re@@ ation of the C@@ A@@ P and their pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts cannot be se@@ par@@ ated from those of the industry as a whole or from the pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity of the rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
one m@@ e@@ a@@ sure of the com@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ity of the situation can be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d in the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses which are now o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red at agricultural c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ es .
at the two c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ es in my region the number of c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses re@@ la@@ ting to farming has now f@@ al@@ l@@ en to 4@@ 0 % in one case , and the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing 6@@ 0 % of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses re@@ la@@ te to h@@ or@@ ses and small an@@ im@@ als .
si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly , 7@@ 0 % of the st@@ u@@ d@@ ents , however , come from farming f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies , so there is still that l@@ in@@ k .
the report s@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ s out that there is a st@@ r@@ on@@ g case for measures to encourage new en@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ ts to the industry and for ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing a much greater de@@ g@@ re@@ e of st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union , and the issue , as the rapporteur mentioned , was well de@@ al@@ t with in the excellent S@@ T@@ O@@ A report at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of last year .
there are many good ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es in that d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment of the v@@ al@@ u@@ able b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al which we were able to use during dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons in committee .
now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine how this programme can be used to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then training and r@@ e @-@ training f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities in our agricultural c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ es .
I would em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e the need for training in f@@ ar@@ m di@@ ver@@ si@@ fication , including l@@ o@@ w @-@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ me products for n@@ ic@@ he mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , and co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es where , by com@@ ing together , in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al f@@ ar@@ m@@ s can se@@ e@@ k to ma@@ t@@ ch the com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al b@@ ar@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ ing st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th of the su@@ per@@ market c@@ ha@@ in@@ s .
I would also wish to see such c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses pa@@ ying special attention to the needs of the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ er f@@ ar@@ m where new en@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ ts are most l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take no@@ te of the many excellent su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons in this report and th@@ us give a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to the future pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity of farming in the rural areas .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to congratulate my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w M@@ E@@ P , Mr P@@ ar@@ ish , on an extremely good report .
I want to f@@ o@@ c@@ us upon the small number of young people going into farming in recent years and , at the same time , the un@@ d@@ u@@ ly large number of people who are also le@@ a@@ v@@ ing it , because , if young people do not come into the industry , there will come a time when ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture no longer ex@@ is@@ t@@ s .
I think that the i@@ ma@@ ge of farming - due to the many ou@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ ks of dis@@ e@@ a@@ se , di@@ o@@ x@@ in s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ als et@@ c - is , at the moment , one of the really major problems .
it pu@@ ts the whole industry in a n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve li@@ g@@ h@@ t and se@@ em@@ s un@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r to the many farming f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies who would , of course , get to@@ p mar@@ ks for the way they look after their f@@ ar@@ m@@ s .
it is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly very important that there should be transparency and that people should be made more aware of production m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s and of the m@@ od@@ er@@ n st@@ al@@ l@@ s and co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed@@ s that now ex@@ is@@ t , as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the w@@ a@@ y@@ s in which fi@@ el@@ ds and an@@ im@@ als are l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed after .
efforts must be con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted on pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing support - m@@ or@@ al , ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al and financial .
no one has in recent years qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ ed the many m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of e@@ u@@ ro@@ s we pu@@ m@@ p into training la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ers and d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
there is a clear par@@ al@@ le@@ l with young farmers who , of course , are responsible for the land and the an@@ im@@ als we have and , especially , the food we e@@ at .
Mr President , I also com@@ m@@ en@@ d Mr P@@ ar@@ ish for his h@@ ar@@ d work and the excellent report .
in the b@@ ri@@ e@@ f time I have I wish to st@@ res@@ s that one of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es f@@ ac@@ ing young farmers en@@ ter@@ ing the b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s today is c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and c@@ as@@ h @-@ f@@ l@@ o@@ w problems in the first year of op@@ er@@ ation .
I am b@@ ac@@ king this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d financial f@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ ing .
after all , young farmers h@@ ol@@ d the key to the future of all our rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
the lack of young people en@@ ter@@ ing the agricultural industry in the U@@ K is a very wor@@ r@@ ying problem .
st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s s@@ how that in I@@ re@@ land 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 8 % of f@@ ar@@ m o@@ w@@ n@@ ers are under 3@@ 5 , in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e is 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 2 % , but in the U@@ K it is a m@@ er@@ e 6@@ .@@ 8 % .
I st@@ res@@ s that f@@ ar@@ m@@ s are also important em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ers in our rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
employment pro@@ te@@ c@@ ts our c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e , it k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ s our p@@ o@@ s@@ t o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es , sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and services open there .
farming and the v@@ i@@ ability of farming is the life b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d of the future of our rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities as we know them .
if all small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses - which in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es farmers - were to em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y just one more per@@ s@@ on each , then the whole un@@ employment situation throughout the European Union would be s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed over@@ n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
of all the European Union countries , only the U@@ K and the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds do not op@@ er@@ ate a specific aid s@@ ch@@ em@@ e for young farmers .
European rural development re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions allow a g@@ r@@ an@@ t of EUR 1@@ 6 5@@ 00 to be made available for people under 4@@ 0 years of age to establish themselves in a v@@ i@@ able f@@ ar@@ m h@@ ol@@ ding .
yet the L@@ ab@@ our government in the U@@ K has not taken ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of this excellent s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
I therefore fully support making in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion a@@ i@@ d@@ s man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union .
the farming industry needs young b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d in order to in@@ j@@ ec@@ t a new v@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ y into an industry which at present is ag@@ ed and dis@@ il@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ on@@ ed .
young farmers are the future of the farming industry and v@@ it@@ al com@@ p@@ on@@ ents in ur@@ b@@ an com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
I thank Mr P@@ ar@@ ish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by h@@ i@@ m in a specific and con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
Mr President , there has been en@@ d@@ less discussion of the role of young people in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , but even today their situation g@@ i@@ v@@ es little cause for op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
it is no co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ence that , after the la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing of A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , in the current p@@ ha@@ se of W@@ T@@ O r@@ en@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations and with the now im@@ min@@ ent pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of enlargement , we are still here today de@@ b@@ ating the future of young farmers , of those young people who , in so many countries in Europe , are pla@@ c@@ ing b@@ et@@ s on whether they will be able to re@@ main within the agricultural sector for good .
how can we help them ?
one of the best s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions can only be to re@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ e the measures la@@ i@@ d down by the C@@ A@@ P .
it is time to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate c@@ a@@ re@@ fully how the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions - as , by defin@@ ition , in@@ come support - re@@ ac@@ h@@ es un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ s able to com@@ p@@ et@@ e on the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al market .
this would make it possible to di@@ rec@@ t the fin@@ an@@ c@@ es towards a v@@ is@@ i@@ on which is more ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted towards l@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ing general costs , en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing the for@@ ma@@ tion of con@@ s@@ or@@ ti@@ a .
we could also work on the j@@ o@@ in@@ t farming of l@@ an@@ ds ; after all , this is the change which will mar@@ k the e@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of farming .
from this point of view , it is then essential to st@@ i@@ pu@@ late that in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es should be pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed in the form of re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tions in the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant interest ra@@ tes for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments made by young farmers .
in this way , we would be im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 2@@ 5@@ 7 of 1999 , which en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ es the com@@ b@@ in@@ ing of se@@ ver@@ al actions when they are a@@ im@@ ed at b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing about greater use of the resources pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by development pl@@ ans for rural areas .
I feel that , if this debate were to s@@ en@@ d out these s@@ or@@ ts of si@@ g@@ n@@ als , we would be able g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y to start b@@ u@@ il@@ ding the framework for a new European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture based on young people which , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , would certainly not mean ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ing and for@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing those who are se@@ e@@ king possible al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es in the new environmental and m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity opportunities .
I would like to thank Mr P@@ ar@@ ish for his excellent work .
Mr President , the P@@ ar@@ ish report pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of an essential issue for the European Community and for those who wish to j@@ o@@ in the Union .
young farmers do indeed need ur@@ g@@ ent attention .
first , because we must support our young people in all areas of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , and secondly because it is in our interests to k@@ e@@ e@@ p the rural population , most of w@@ h@@ o@@ m are con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with agricultural ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities , in the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
in ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ ing this issue , we have to ap@@ p@@ ra@@ ise el@@ em@@ ents that li@@ e at the ro@@ o@@ t@@ s of our social st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture , our ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al organisation , our ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , our c@@ ul@@ ture and our c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ is@@ ation itself .
many of the problems that a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t these farmers are su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally concerned with one of the b@@ a@@ se@@ s of the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant economic mo@@ de@@ l in Europe ; p@@ ri@@ va@@ te land o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p and the for@@ m@@ s of land trans@@ f@@ er .
this report con@@ ta@@ in@@ s an ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al action b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ ing a specific group and also for the implementation of con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures to give rural land o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p a m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful social f@@ un@@ c@@ tion .
in this context , the opinion of the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t se@@ em@@ s to me h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly appropriate when it st@@ a@@ tes that young farmers are not a very h@@ om@@ o@@ g@@ en@@ e@@ ous group .
a d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion must be d@@ ra@@ w@@ n between st@@ u@@ d@@ ents at agricultural sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s and c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ es , young people who wish to set up in rural areas as an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to the ur@@ b@@ an environment , and the children of farmers .
even within this last group I would d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish between those who are the children of farmers who work on the land and those who are d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts of farmers who , from the si@@ z@@ e of their h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s , are really agricultural b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ men .
while acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting that measures should be taken to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es on in@@ h@@ er@@ it@@ ing pro@@ per@@ ty , I would h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t other actions also mentioned in the P@@ ar@@ ish report to help make h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s v@@ i@@ able , which are based on s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o @-@ economic for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ s .
I should like to st@@ res@@ s another as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the report : we must t@@ r@@ y to ensure that when our future c@@ o @-@ Members of the Union in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate the ac@@ qu@@ is com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ta@@ ir@@ e they do not bring in h@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ en ha@@ b@@ its that h@@ in@@ d@@ er the development of the rural environment in their countries .
the change from c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ is@@ ed farming ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies to s@@ it@@ u@@ ations that can be m@@ er@@ ged with the Community situation may t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er o@@ f@@ f s@@ p@@ ec@@ u@@ la@@ tive pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses that will ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ally ra@@ ise market pr@@ ic@@ es for land and th@@ us increase young farmers &apos; di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es in se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up or k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing themselves in the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
this report , Mr President , will certainly be important in so far as we can also dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it in our own countries , in the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries , and in particular in the sector it s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses .
Mr President , there is indeed a crisis of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion in farming as Mr P@@ ar@@ ish with his ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise as a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er k@@ no@@ ws well .
if this crisis is particularly ac@@ u@@ te in Mr P@@ ar@@ ish &apos;s own Member State , it is the di@@ rec@@ t result of policies pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by U@@ K governments over the past t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years , and to over@@ come it the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m must re@@ view the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of the F@@ on@@ ta@@ in@@ b@@ le@@ a@@ u A@@ g@@ re@@ ement for its contribution to European Union fin@@ an@@ c@@ es .
this has been dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s for farming .
mo@@ re@@ over , the rapporteur , a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party , must work within his own par@@ ty to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e support for his proposals in the House of C@@ om@@ m@@ ons .
in countries where less than 1@@ 0 % of the population now li@@ v@@ es in rural areas , it is too e@@ as@@ y for governments to si@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ e the needs of these areas , and the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge from this debate must be that they do so at the per@@ i@@ l of their countries .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr N@@ e@@ i@@ l P@@ ar@@ ish on the fact that he has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a report which is based on the farmers &apos; re@@ al@@ ity , the re@@ al@@ ity in rural areas , and not on the view from B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
this in itself con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a v@@ al@@ u@@ able contribution to agricultural policy .
but if we now ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the situation , we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people le@@ f@@ t out there who are ma@@ d enough to become farmers in the European Union .
what we need is people who want to take up the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing an ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement , fi@@ ve @-@ le@@ g@@ ged sh@@ e@@ e@@ p as it were , but not ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed through g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c mo@@ di@@ fication .
they se@@ e@@ m to be fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting a l@@ o@@ s@@ ing b@@ att@@ le , if we consider the ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ities which young farmers f@@ ac@@ e , as well as the ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ents they are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er .
to qu@@ o@@ t@@ e just one example - and I am just con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing my own country for a moment - d@@ a@@ ir@@ y farming is a sector where ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is being s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ ised , from the b@@ la@@ de of gra@@ s@@ s right up to the moment that the m@@ il@@ k h@@ its the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
I cannot help d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing a com@@ par@@ is@@ on with ar@@ able farmers and h@@ or@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s who have been re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to k@@ e@@ e@@ p ta@@ b@@ s on the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of their actions on the environment and con@@ su@@ m@@ er f@@ r@@ on@@ t for a long time , and do so with great en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
at the same time , we have to say that in many European countries the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for an@@ i@@ ma@@ l w@@ el@@ f@@ are are a@@ m@@ on@@ g the world &apos; s most st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent .
so w@@ h@@ o@@ ever w@@ an@@ ts to become a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er in Europe must ou@@ t@@ st@@ ri@@ p their c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ par@@ ts el@@ se@@ where in the world .
they need to give the l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and cultural conditions due con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
they must apply the st@@ r@@ ic@@ te@@ st con@@ su@@ m@@ er conditions , su@@ p@@ p@@ ly a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of products , both re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally and in terms of quality , make an@@ i@@ ma@@ l w@@ el@@ f@@ are a to@@ p priority and be responsible for the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t , even once it has le@@ f@@ t the f@@ ar@@ m .
this is what we call social en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ ing as a to@@ p @-@ level s@@ por@@ t .
it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ sh@@ i@@ p , a l@@ o@@ ve of nature and the environment , social or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance .
for this reason al@@ one , it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is f@@ o@@ c@@ used on the future .
some of the f@@ o@@ c@@ al points could in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m s@@ ch@@ em@@ e l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to quality , l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and environmental protection , but also the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of an ec@@ o @-@ tax in other economic se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , not pa@@ y@@ able by the farmers but by the con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , to fin@@ ance those ex@@ t@@ r@@ a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments which farmers need to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l , and to re@@ in@@ for@@ ce the market position of farmers and con@@ su@@ m@@ ers .
what st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es me in the European Union &apos; s com@@ p@@ et@@ ition policy as a whole , is that although it is en@@ j@@ o@@ ying a great deal of attention , in the food sector , for example , the con@@ su@@ m@@ ers , the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts that is , are gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally g@@ a@@ in@@ ing a m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ y position , and that at the same time s@@ al@@ es from f@@ ar@@ m@@ s , the small @-@ sc@@ al@@ e d@@ im@@ en@@ sion , are still f@@ ra@@ g@@ m@@ en@@ ted .
in that s@@ en@@ se , it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble if both C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers M@@ on@@ t@@ i and B@@ ol@@ k@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ in were more c@@ r@@ it@@ ical in their as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of this area in terms of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
Mr President , no@@ b@@ od@@ y can sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve for one day without food ; it is life re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment number one .
this re@@ qu@@ i@@ res mo@@ ti@@ va@@ ted pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers .
this means that food does not just st@@ and for market for@@ c@@ es , but also for public health , l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e and nature .
in sh@@ or@@ t , if we re@@ al@@ ise this , then we will know that , in future , young farmers will need to be fi@@ ve @-@ le@@ g@@ ged sh@@ e@@ e@@ p , and in that s@@ en@@ se , d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve more support , more political support than they are rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing at the moment .
Mr President , Commissioner , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , I should like to start by th@@ an@@ king Mr P@@ ar@@ ish for his serious an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the situation of young farmers in Europe .
I ask you , what shall we do when there is no one to take over our f@@ ar@@ m@@ s ?
S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l change is important and it is right , but that should not result in a ma@@ s@@ s ex@@ od@@ us from the farming prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
if we want farming to have a future in Europe , then we must se@@ c@@ ur@@ e its su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
we are in favour of a m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al farming mo@@ de@@ l , i@@ .@@ e@@ . a mo@@ de@@ l w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by farmers are not just responsible for pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing food and a large part of their work b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its society as a whole , a society which can take p@@ le@@ a@@ sure in se@@ e@@ ing nature un@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ il@@ ed and en@@ j@@ o@@ y rural areas which are wor@@ th li@@ v@@ ing in .
the agricultural policy and the policy for the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e as a whole li@@ v@@ es for and from its in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts .
we therefore need to c@@ re@@ ate framework conditions which ensure that young people look on the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e as s@@ om@@ e@@ where wor@@ th li@@ v@@ ing in and are w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to continue the farming tra@@ d@@ ition .
se@@ t@@ t@@ ing @-@ up aid and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment g@@ r@@ an@@ ts are essential for young farmers , but m@@ od@@ er@@ n te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y has an e@@ qu@@ ally important part to pla@@ y .
young farmers need to be as f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with com@@ pu@@ ters and the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t as they are with se@@ ed and the an@@ im@@ als in their st@@ al@@ l@@ s .
this means that training and further training for young farmers are b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing more and more important and I , for one , support li@@ f@@ el@@ on@@ g le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing in farming and a@@ m@@ on@@ g farmers .
allow me to say a few b@@ ri@@ e@@ f words on the social aspects . time and again I he@@ a@@ r farmers using various ar@@ gu@@ ments to put o@@ f@@ f le@@ a@@ v@@ ing their f@@ ar@@ m@@ s to their children or su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ s .
l@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing go is difficult , as I know from per@@ s@@ on@@ al ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , but it is the only way of en@@ sur@@ ing sur@@ v@@ i@@ va@@ l .
so I call on the ol@@ d@@ er g@@ en@@ er@@ ations to help the young and to give them and , h@@ ence , the whole farming industry the same ch@@ ance which they had .
of course , and I say this quite op@@ en@@ ly as a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , it is no help when all we he@@ a@@ r about is the down si@@ d@@ e of the prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
let us be quite clear about one th@@ ing : there is not a s@@ in@@ g@@ le prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion which is either all good or all b@@ a@@ d .
finally , I should like to say that it g@@ la@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ s my he@@ ar@@ t when I see e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed and young farmers working together to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the f@@ ar@@ m , ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences and c@@ re@@ ating and pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing in@@ no@@ va@@ tive i@@ d@@ e@@ as into practice .
their d@@ ed@@ ic@@ ation and commitment will be n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in the future even more than ever and we must encourage su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve g@@ en@@ er@@ ations to be op@@ ti@@ mis@@ ti@@ c and take their future into their own h@@ an@@ ds .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by j@@ o@@ in@@ ing in the gra@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed to Mr P@@ ar@@ ish .
I think this is a very con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive own @-@ initiative report .
there is a rather n@@ ice sa@@ ying that the future b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to the young , but we can t@@ u@@ r@@ n this ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d when we t@@ al@@ k of European farming and say that , without young farmers , there is no future .
the future of the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e , and especially the future of young farmers in Europe , does not look good .
the n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers al@@ one should set our al@@ ar@@ m b@@ el@@ l@@ s r@@ in@@ g@@ ing .
the number of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s in the EU has f@@ al@@ l@@ en con@@ st@@ an@@ tly over recent years .
of course , we welcome the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l change but , at the same time , the ex@@ t@@ ent of the change does give us cause for concern .
the b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ est dec@@ re@@ a@@ se has been in the number of farmers under the age of 3@@ 5 .
thank G@@ o@@ d that young people from f@@ ar@@ m@@ s have the same c@@ a@@ re@@ er pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts as their p@@ e@@ er groups and si@@ b@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ s .
the tra@@ d@@ ition of h@@ an@@ ding f@@ ar@@ m@@ s down from one g@@ en@@ er@@ ation to the next is dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ ing .
the question of what b@@ ec@@ om@@ es of the ol@@ d@@ er g@@ en@@ er@@ ation le@@ f@@ t on the f@@ ar@@ m is often still un@@ an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red .
unfortunately , f@@ ar@@ m@@ s st@@ an@@ ding em@@ p@@ ty have become a f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r si@@ g@@ h@@ t - even in my country , which I would n@@ e@@ v@@ er have i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ed possible .
how many young people want to have to k@@ e@@ e@@ p making ex@@ c@@ u@@ se@@ s because they are farmers ?
young farmers want f@@ a@@ i@@ r pr@@ ic@@ es for their products .
it is not because of the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es that they c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e to be farmers .
the P@@ ar@@ ish report may help to improve the over@@ all i@@ ma@@ ge of young farmers .
the public pa@@ y@@ s sc@@ ant attention to the services of farming .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , for re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting the m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al ta@@ s@@ k which farming f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ s .
but ap@@ par@@ ently b@@ a@@ d n@@ e@@ ws makes better n@@ e@@ ws .
at the moment , you can re@@ a@@ d about the current B@@ S@@ E crisis b@@ l@@ o@@ w by b@@ l@@ o@@ w .
but no one bo@@ th@@ ers to m@@ en@@ tion , for example , that con@@ su@@ m@@ er as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations in my country have been w@@ an@@ t@@ only c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ing for food at ro@@ c@@ k bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m pr@@ ic@@ es for years now .
of course I dis@@ ap@@ pro@@ ve of the c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ations of the fe@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ st@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ s industry , the lack of con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s by the authorities and so for@@ th , but it is all this together which has re@@ su@@ l@@ ted in the c@@ ha@@ o@@ s in which more and more members of the prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion find themselves .
if you b@@ el@@ on@@ g to this prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion , if you are a f@@ ar@@ m@@ er , then you will e@@ a@@ si@@ ly understand why young people ask , do I really need this ?
with the current B@@ S@@ E situation , it is quite out of order to p@@ il@@ l@@ or@@ y our farmers and young farmers .
we have set st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds .
so @-@ called &apos; good prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al practice &apos; has been con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed by our ex@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ently tra@@ in@@ ed young farmers .
essential services in the production of f@@ o@@ od@@ st@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ s and ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als , the development , further development and p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e and the protection of the natural b@@ a@@ se@@ s for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future .
I should like to c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e by sa@@ ying that these young farmers do not just need re@@ li@@ able policies ; they also need good w@@ i@@ v@@ es and st@@ r@@ on@@ g f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies .
only this s@@ or@@ t of environment can give them the st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th they need to per@@ form their important f@@ un@@ c@@ tion in society .
Mr President , I no@@ te that the last se@@ v@@ en s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers in this debate come from the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party , so we have se@@ v@@ en people an@@ x@@ i@@ ous to t@@ al@@ k while e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y el@@ se has d@@ ri@@ ed up .
it is an in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing .
I want to thank Mr P@@ ar@@ ish for his contribution , the th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and the very ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve report he has pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
I was just th@@ in@@ king of my y@@ ou@@ th when I was a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the Y@@ ou@@ n@@ g F@@ ar@@ m@@ ers of I@@ re@@ land ; I st@@ ar@@ ted my political c@@ a@@ re@@ er in that organisation .
I re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er a plan was pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed which was based on two si@@ m@@ p@@ le things : in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve ad@@ v@@ ice and a little b@@ it of financial in@@ c@@ en@@ tive .
it was based on the g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c uni@@ t of organisation , which was most p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r in I@@ re@@ land , it was a ch@@ ur@@ ch com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity called the par@@ ish .
it was the par@@ ish plan .
so I st@@ ar@@ ted o@@ f@@ f my political life with the par@@ ish plan in my hand and today I have another P@@ ar@@ ish plan .
it is much more com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve and , indeed , I have to con@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ s that I do not see as many si@@ m@@ p@@ le an@@ s@@ w@@ ers to the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons raised in this one as in my Y@@ ou@@ n@@ g F@@ ar@@ m@@ ers &apos; organisation in I@@ re@@ land 4@@ 0 years ago .
something that comes to mind is that we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t not to get carried a@@ way with em@@ o@@ tion or le@@ a@@ d people down the w@@ r@@ on@@ g p@@ at@@ h on this whole subject .
the 1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 6 c@@ en@@ su@@ s in I@@ re@@ land f@@ ou@@ n@@ d that more than h@@ al@@ f of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e population of the country was en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and yet the country did not pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ ses and there were people sh@@ or@@ t of food .
there are still people h@@ ar@@ king back to the d@@ a@@ y@@ s when , as an I@@ r@@ ish p@@ o@@ e@@ t said : &quot; every ro@@ o@@ d of g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed its m@@ an . &quot;
however , we should not i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that this was an i@@ d@@ e@@ al world in which to li@@ ve .
over the years , as the number of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s was re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed and farmers b@@ ec@@ a@@ me more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent , food ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly b@@ ec@@ a@@ me more available to the p@@ o@@ or who could b@@ u@@ y it at a l@@ o@@ w@@ er c@@ o@@ s@@ t .
the re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed f@@ ar@@ m n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers have pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a l@@ o@@ t of well @-@ being in Europe .
we should not for@@ get that .
since I@@ re@@ land j@@ o@@ in@@ ed the European Union - I only m@@ en@@ tion I@@ re@@ land because I am very f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , but you can draw l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ons for other areas - our many small f@@ ar@@ m@@ s were re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally in number .
if it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very pa@@ in@@ ful .
it was a good th@@ ing that the number of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s was re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed and that we had the common agricultural policy to e@@ a@@ se that .
we must be concerned about the human problems that ar@@ ise out of the s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ e @-@ out of ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve la@@ b@@ our , but at the same time , we should re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of food has been re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s , in the future , must be put on quality , while in my time l@@ im@@ it@@ less qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities were n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment .
all these are things Mr P@@ ar@@ ish has under@@ l@@ in@@ ed .
but we should not o@@ f@@ f@@ er the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of young , en@@ er@@ g@@ e@@ ti@@ c people in greater n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity of food that Europe needs today because they will not e@@ at it .
Mr President , could I be@@ g@@ in by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr P@@ ar@@ ish on b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing forward a very excellent report .
I know very well that he put a l@@ o@@ t of time and e@@ f@@ for@@ t into it and I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y it can be de@@ b@@ ated by Parliament today .
it is a very difficult subject to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s and there is no e@@ as@@ y s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to the problem of young farmers , as any of us who have any k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the problem and the b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d would accept .
of course , e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y l@@ i@@ k@@ es to say we must help the young farmers .
the problem is when you ask them how to make the help really wor@@ th@@ while , they are very s@@ l@@ o@@ w to come forward with an@@ s@@ w@@ ers .
how can you encourage young people on@@ to the land ?
you have to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today .
many young people from rural areas some 20 , 3@@ 0 or 4@@ 0 years ago , at the time Mr M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ t@@ in was s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king about , would n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally have g@@ one on to become young farmers .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ y@@ s those young people have many other op@@ tions open to them .
they look ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d and they see their f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds going into j@@ o@@ b@@ s where they may qu@@ it working at l@@ u@@ n@@ ch@@ time on F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y and not start work again until the M@@ on@@ day m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
but the young f@@ ar@@ m@@ er will work se@@ v@@ en d@@ a@@ y@@ s a w@@ e@@ e@@ k for very little money .
you only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a ter@@ ri@@ ble problem here and one that is not going to be e@@ as@@ y to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s .
the re@@ al@@ ity is that if you do not get young people into the industry , you will not bring the new i@@ d@@ e@@ as in and you will not allow the industry to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p and take on the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es that it f@@ ac@@ es in the future , re@@ la@@ ting not just to the production of food , but to how that food is pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed and to en@@ sur@@ ing that it is pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in a way the con@@ su@@ m@@ er fin@@ ds acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
it is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the pr@@ ice of la@@ m@@ b up out of re@@ ac@@ h .
we in the European Union have b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t in m@@ il@@ k quotas , we have b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t in su@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ er co@@ w quotas , we have b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t in sh@@ e@@ e@@ p quotas , all now with a financial v@@ al@@ u@@ e that the young f@@ ar@@ m@@ er could not even be@@ g@@ in to con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late .
so I believe the best way is to make it e@@ a@@ si@@ er for young farmers to in@@ h@@ er@@ it the family f@@ ar@@ m at an e@@ ar@@ li@@ er stage , be it through an e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ e or through a b@@ on@@ d s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
I certainly feel that the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k should be en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged to help young farmers into the industry through the b@@ on@@ d s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
but , if you are going to bring this s@@ ch@@ em@@ e in it has to be man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y and it has to be in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in every Member State .
it is not enough to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce it in one Member State al@@ one .
finally , we are s@@ pen@@ ding a l@@ o@@ t of money on rural development and the Commission would do well to look at other w@@ a@@ y@@ s of s@@ pen@@ ding that money , because , as I see it , we could make better use of it .
we could encourage young farmers , who f@@ ac@@ e so much red ta@@ p@@ e and b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y now .
young farmers have com@@ pu@@ ters .
farmers &apos; w@@ i@@ v@@ es know how to use com@@ pu@@ ters and could use them on the f@@ ar@@ m .
that is the way forward for the future .
Mr President , I welcome this report .
it certainly h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts the b@@ le@@ a@@ k future f@@ ac@@ ing young farmers within the European Union , despite the support pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the Union and Member States .
the current un@@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble economic c@@ li@@ ma@@ te for farming in general and young farmers in particular , the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous lack of pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for young farmers , the dec@@ line in the number of full @-@ time farmers and the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ag@@ e@@ ing of those who re@@ main - these are all general t@@ r@@ en@@ ds which under@@ line the problem .
it is clear that we will ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence a d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic d@@ ro@@ p in the number of young farmers over the next c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of dec@@ ad@@ es , un@@ less appropriate and effective measures are put in place now .
young farmers f@@ ac@@ e en@@ or@@ m@@ ous problems such as the ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve financial b@@ ur@@ d@@ en when they start up and often this can be com@@ p@@ ou@@ n@@ ded by di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with in@@ h@@ er@@ it@@ ance .
training is often de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent , and for young people it can be an is@@ ol@@ ated life in rural areas , with l@@ im@@ ited social ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity in com@@ par@@ is@@ on with those of a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r age who work in more ur@@ b@@ an se@@ t@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ s .
all of this be@@ g@@ s the question : what can the European Union do ?
a European policy a@@ im@@ ed at su@@ p@@ por@@ ting young farmers and l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to the C@@ A@@ P is essential .
up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission .
greater attention must be given to interest ra@@ te su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es and l@@ o@@ ans , in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion a@@ i@@ d@@ s and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment g@@ r@@ an@@ ts must be pa@@ i@@ d more s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ il@@ y and the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of enlargement on young farmers need to be con@@ si@@ de@@ red and in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into any future policy approach .
other measures that could be con@@ si@@ de@@ red are su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment aid for farmers under 4@@ 0 , production rights , assistance with c@@ re@@ d@@ it terms , better education , training and n@@ et@@ working opportunities - one could go on .
but the point I want to make is that we need to do something now .
to take up the point made by Mr N@@ ic@@ h@@ ol@@ s@@ on : why should young people in the C@@ el@@ ti@@ c T@@ i@@ g@@ er ec@@ on@@ om@@ y in I@@ re@@ land re@@ main on the land ?
why should they f@@ ac@@ e an an@@ t@@ i @-@ social life ?
why should they be in a c@@ a@@ re@@ er which has economic un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y when other o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ pa@@ tions o@@ f@@ f@@ er a much more att@@ ra@@ c@@ tive life , much more security , work from 9 a@@ .@@ m@@ . to 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , with w@@ e@@ e@@ k @-@ en@@ ds o@@ f@@ f and with long h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s ?
that is the problem we have to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s and we must ad@@ d@@ res@@ s it now .
Mr President , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , I should like to start by th@@ an@@ king you , Mr P@@ ar@@ ish , for your e@@ ar@@ n@@ est report on the situation and per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ es of young farmers in the European Union .
I should also like to thank the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment for its work .
we have en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red in A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , especially by de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing the second p@@ il@@ la@@ r , to take account of the concerns of young farmers .
in some organisations of the market , we have at least man@@ ag@@ ed to g@@ r@@ an@@ t special terms to n@@ e@@ w@@ ly e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed farmers or young farmers .
I need only m@@ en@@ tion the sh@@ e@@ e@@ p pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m or the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of national m@@ il@@ k qu@@ o@@ t@@ a res@@ er@@ v@@ es or pl@@ an@@ ting rights under the programme to re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture and con@@ ver@@ t v@@ in@@ e@@ y@@ ar@@ ds .
but , without d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , the real issue here is the future of farming per se , because if young people are no longer pre@@ pa@@ red to take up farming , then any further debate on ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture is su@@ per@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ous .
and , without d@@ ou@@ b@@ t , the att@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of farming also de@@ pen@@ ds a great deal on the political framework conditions which apply to ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , not just agricultural policy as a whole , but also the specific terms on which a young per@@ s@@ on can en@@ ter this prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
measures to promote rural development are particularly important here .
agenda 2000 in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m se@@ t@@ t@@ ing @-@ up g@@ r@@ an@@ t by 6@@ 6 % , m@@ e@@ an@@ ing that up to EUR 2@@ 5 000 can now be pa@@ i@@ d in aid , and l@@ o@@ ans to fin@@ ance se@@ t@@ t@@ ing @-@ up costs qu@@ al@@ i@@ fy for interest ra@@ te su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es .
at the same time , the terms g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments in farming op@@ er@@ ations in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the op@@ tion of in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m ra@@ te of aid for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments by young farmers within the first fi@@ ve years of st@@ ar@@ ting up .
these aid ra@@ tes may be as high as 4@@ 5 % and , in dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged areas , as much as 5@@ 5 % .
a@@ part from this specific aid for young farmers , there are , of course , all the other for@@ m@@ s of aid which young farmers can c@@ la@@ i@@ m just as any other f@@ ar@@ m@@ er can .
on b@@ al@@ ance , the rules for pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing the development of the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e are extremely f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble but , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , it is up to the Member States to implement them .
the Member States are responsible for dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing what priority should be given to pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing young farmers .
finally , I should also like to point out - and se@@ ver@@ al Member States have already g@@ one for this op@@ tion - that the e@@ ar@@ ly re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , the el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble su@@ m@@ s for which have again been raised under A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 , can be l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to se@@ t@@ t@@ ing @-@ up aid for young farmers .
the Commission , like Parliament , fe@@ el@@ s that we need a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s if we are to make better policy as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments .
the information which the Commission com@@ p@@ il@@ es v@@ i@@ a the information n@@ et@@ work of agricultural ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts and st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l sur@@ v@@ e@@ y@@ s should , in fact , su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e in order to an@@ al@@ y@@ se the situation of young farmers and I do not think that we need , n@@ or does it make s@@ en@@ se to set up a new d@@ a@@ ta@@ b@@ a@@ se especially for young farmers .
what we do need is for the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments in question to be made available .
the Commission services are currently working with the Member States e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ating the ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents for which pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on is made in the e@@ ar@@ li@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 regulation , especially with re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to young farmers .
I am sure that we shall g@@ le@@ an some u@@ se@@ ful f@@ ac@@ ts from this ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise , but I must point out that we shall be un@@ able to su@@ b@@ m@@ it an in@@ it@@ i@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the programmes still being ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed by next year because we quite simply do not have the necessary d@@ at@@ a .
the Member States are able to a@@ m@@ en@@ d pl@@ ans to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e , especially in order to take account of the results of in@@ te@@ ri@@ m as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments .
the Commission does not in@@ t@@ end to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce any new Community initiatives now ; it pre@@ f@@ ers to k@@ e@@ e@@ p to the se@@ v@@ en @-@ year term p@@ res@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed in the A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a and the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant legislation .
but we must not for@@ get that the young and women are priority ta@@ r@@ get groups under the L@@ E@@ A@@ D@@ E@@ R + Community initiative and that the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment system which the Member States need to work out in order to s@@ el@@ ec@@ t p@@ il@@ o@@ t projects needs to take account of this f@@ o@@ c@@ us in Community policy .
many of the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed in the report and the motion for a resolution , such as land pr@@ ic@@ es or the a@@ va@@ il@@ ability of f@@ ar@@ m@@ land or in@@ h@@ er@@ it@@ ance tax or the tax st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s , are matters for which the Member States al@@ one are responsible .
however , despite a great deal of c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m , the Commission will ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the P@@ ar@@ ish report within the l@@ im@@ its of its p@@ o@@ w@@ ers and right of initiative in a b@@ i@@ d to help improve the conditions of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment for young farmers and re@@ v@@ i@@ ve the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
thank you very much , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .

subject : ab@@ ol@@ ition of ex@@ tra@@ d@@ ition between S@@ pa@@ in and I@@ t@@ al@@ y S@@ pa@@ in and I@@ t@@ al@@ y rec@@ ently si@@ g@@ n@@ ed a t@@ re@@ at@@ y on the pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m @-@ re@@ la@@ ted c@@ r@@ im@@ e , tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s , et@@ c . , which ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ es ex@@ tra@@ d@@ ition and se@@ ts up a common area of freedom , security and j@@ u@@ st@@ ice between two Member States for the first time .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the European Parliament rec@@ ently agreed that EU institutions should be able to adopt effective measures to com@@ b@@ at ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , particularly as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds se@@ ar@@ ch and c@@ ap@@ ture or@@ d@@ ers within Europe .
is the Commission re@@ ad@@ y to pu@@ s@@ h forward with measures to give effect to what Parliament has agreed with respect to com@@ b@@ ating ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and the is@@ su@@ ing of se@@ ar@@ ch and c@@ ap@@ ture or@@ d@@ ers in particular ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission g@@ a@@ ve a commitment to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to the request made at the T@@ a@@ m@@ per@@ e European Council to draw up le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposals to re@@ place the for@@ ma@@ l ex@@ tra@@ d@@ ition process with a si@@ m@@ p@@ le procedure for trans@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing per@@ s@@ ons who have been con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted and who t@@ r@@ y to e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ e j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
at the last J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs Council , held on 3@@ 0 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 , I ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed the Commission &apos; s s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y with Member States who f@@ ac@@ e the problem of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and , in particular , with S@@ pa@@ in , and I was d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to welcome the b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l agreement con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded between S@@ pa@@ in and I@@ t@@ al@@ y .
on that o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion , I an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed that in the course of 2001 , the Commission would su@@ b@@ m@@ it proposals on three essential points for the Council &apos; s con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
firstly , there will be a proposal on common defin@@ it@@ i@@ ons , in@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ations and s@@ an@@ c@@ tions for c@@ r@@ im@@ es in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m .
secondly f@@ a@@ st @-@ tra@@ c@@ k ex@@ tra@@ d@@ ition procedures between Member States will be in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we will su@@ b@@ m@@ it a proposal on the c@@ re@@ ation of an in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment k@@ no@@ w@@ n as the European se@@ ar@@ ch and c@@ ap@@ ture order .
the Commission has already called a meeting of national ex@@ per@@ ts in these fi@@ el@@ ds , which will be held in the next few d@@ a@@ y@@ s , on the basis of a working pa@@ per that is being d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up to present the proposals that I have just mentioned .
I wish to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate the Commission &apos; s commitment , using all its p@@ o@@ w@@ ers under the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es , to encourage t@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ er European action against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , an issue that will be given great pr@@ om@@ in@@ ence in the Commission &apos; s work programme for 2001 , which will sh@@ or@@ tly be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed in this House .
I must say that I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d with the Commission &apos; s re@@ p@@ ly and positive att@@ it@@ u@@ de to se@@ e@@ k for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ s and implement measures that can e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y control the wor@@ st en@@ em@@ y of freedom and democracy : ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m .
but what is the problem , Commissioner ?
the problem is the ur@@ g@@ ent need to la@@ y down some con@@ c@@ re@@ te de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ es for these measures to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible .
as you know , Commissioner , the European Parliament has ur@@ g@@ ed that the European se@@ ar@@ ch and c@@ ap@@ ture order should be pu@@ sh@@ ed a@@ he@@ a@@ d as an in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing the necessary f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility and s@@ p@@ e@@ ed to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the c@@ ap@@ ture , pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion and s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ ing of those who in European ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y are v@@ i@@ ol@@ ating the most f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l right of all ; the right to life .
it would be a real ab@@ er@@ ra@@ tion if in the new European Union area of freedom , security and j@@ u@@ st@@ ice the law s@@ er@@ v@@ ed p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y to support those who com@@ m@@ it@@ ted such a d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ able c@@ r@@ im@@ e .
I wish to be@@ g@@ in by sa@@ ying that I share Mr M@@ ol@@ la@@ r &apos; s s@@ en@@ se of ur@@ g@@ ency .
ur@@ g@@ ency is indeed c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al in this matter .
I would say that the most ur@@ g@@ ent need is for all Member States to ap@@ pro@@ ve and ra@@ ti@@ fy the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 con@@ v@@ en@@ tions on ex@@ tra@@ d@@ ition .
that is ur@@ g@@ ency is most v@@ it@@ al .
secondly , on the European se@@ ar@@ ch and c@@ ap@@ ture order , as you will see in the 2001 work programme , we shall have very con@@ c@@ re@@ te d@@ a@@ tes and de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ es for the Commission to present its proposals .
I can guarantee that 2001 will be a t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing point in the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , which is a fi@@ g@@ h@@ t s@@ ha@@ red by all European countries , not as a problem for a s@@ in@@ g@@ le State but as a th@@ re@@ at to freedom , security and j@@ u@@ st@@ ice throughout the European Union .

the European Union sa@@ y@@ s that it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t women from such un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion and pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ment , but it has not yet f@@ ou@@ n@@ d a way of trans@@ la@@ ting its dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations into political actions and decisions o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for hope .
would the Commission be in favour of pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing forward proposals w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by such s@@ it@@ u@@ ations a@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ting women might be con@@ si@@ de@@ red g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for g@@ r@@ an@@ ting a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and re@@ f@@ u@@ ge , in political terms , in the European Union ?
I wish to say in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to Mrs I@@ z@@ qu@@ i@@ er@@ do R@@ o@@ j@@ o &apos; s question that re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s is g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ed throughout the world by the 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 1 G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion and the 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 7 P@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l re@@ la@@ ting to the S@@ ta@@ t@@ u@@ s of R@@ e@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
at European level , a non @-@ b@@ in@@ ding common position of 4 M@@ ar@@ ch 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 adopted under the M@@ a@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ h@@ t Treaty ap@@ p@@ li@@ es ; this re@@ la@@ tes to uni@@ form ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the term &quot; re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e &quot; under the terms of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1 of the 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 1 G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
however , there is no uni@@ form ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the defin@@ ition of the term &quot; re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e &quot; throughout Member States .
n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 1 C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion n@@ or the European Union te@@ x@@ ts make specific re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to issues concerning re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s made by women , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally women w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e human rights have been v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated , with particular re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ re@@ la@@ ted ab@@ use , such as se@@ x@@ u@@ al v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , g@@ en@@ it@@ al m@@ u@@ ti@@ la@@ tion or f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l legal dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of their g@@ en@@ d@@ er .
with the en@@ t@@ r@@ y into force of the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am , the Union now has , following T@@ a@@ m@@ per@@ e , a man@@ d@@ ate to adopt common min@@ im@@ u@@ m rules in the field of a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e protection , with a view , in the m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m term , to ad@@ op@@ ting a common European a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m system .
the Commission in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to ta@@ ble specific proposals in relation to some of these in the course of 2001 .
these proposals will take account of the specific c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of women who have been v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of ab@@ use and m@@ is@@ t@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
indeed , the Commission has already be@@ gu@@ n to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p actions de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the specific c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of these women .
an example of this is the proposal for a directive on pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing te@@ m@@ por@@ ary protection in the e@@ v@@ ent of a ma@@ s@@ s in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ x of dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons , which we p@@ res@@ en@@ ted on 2@@ 4 M@@ a@@ y last year .
in this proposal , under the terms of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 1 ( 4 ) , Member States are ob@@ li@@ ged to provide appropriate m@@ ed@@ ical assistance or other for@@ m@@ s of assistance to women who have been v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of t@@ or@@ ture , ra@@ p@@ e or other serious for@@ m@@ s of p@@ s@@ y@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical , p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al or se@@ x@@ u@@ al v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
the Commission also in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e measures concerning per@@ s@@ ons with special needs in its proposal for a directive on rec@@ e@@ p@@ tion conditions for a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers , which will be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in the first qu@@ ar@@ ter of this year .
with regard to the specific issue of g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ re@@ la@@ ted per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion for@@ m@@ ing the basis of the a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m request , the Commission has already em@@ b@@ ar@@ k@@ ed on ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion on this matter and we hope that in the course of this year we will be able to draw the necessary con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons to present to Parliament and the Council a proposal for su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ary protection that would also co@@ v@@ er this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of situation .
thank you , Mr V@@ it@@ or@@ in@@ o , because I understand that the Commission in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to su@@ b@@ m@@ it proposals .
I should like to say that , in the last dec@@ ad@@ e of the c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y that has just fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , both the V@@ i@@ en@@ n@@ a C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence and su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently the B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence op@@ en@@ ed up new h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ ons so that we can be@@ a@@ r in mind the very real situation in which women su@@ f@@ f@@ er in n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous countries , but I believe the Commissioner under@@ st@@ an@@ ds the question Mrs I@@ z@@ qu@@ i@@ er@@ do has raised and I am gra@@ te@@ ful that he is to make this kind of proposal .
as they deal with the same subject , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 2@@ 7 and 2@@ 8 will be taken together .

does the Commission re@@ al@@ ise that , by w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing the ex@@ por@@ t re@@ f@@ un@@ d ent@@ it@@ l@@ ement for ch@@ em@@ ical products d@@ er@@ i@@ v@@ ed from agricultural ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als , it has further s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly im@@ pa@@ i@@ red the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the European ch@@ em@@ ical industry which is already de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies of sc@@ al@@ e en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed by the g@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ s@@ e su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ers of its U@@ S c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ par@@ ts as a result of the EU qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system for is@@ o@@ g@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ s@@ e and the lack of an e@@ th@@ an@@ o@@ l programme in the EU ?
Mr President , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , the Community ch@@ em@@ ical industry did indeed st@@ o@@ p rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing ex@@ por@@ t re@@ funds at the end of J@@ u@@ ly last year for agricultural ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als such as st@@ ar@@ ch , g@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ s@@ e and su@@ g@@ a@@ r , which are pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sed for ex@@ por@@ t .
this m@@ e@@ a@@ sure is part of a s@@ er@@ ies of pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons for so @-@ called non @-@ A@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ x I products which was dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the Council of agricultural min@@ is@@ ters in M@@ ar@@ ch last year , since when ex@@ por@@ ts of these products have been subject to b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the agreement dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed within the W@@ T@@ O .
however , these products still rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve enough com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion to be able to com@@ p@@ et@@ e with si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r products on the world market .
it is therefore h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly un@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y that im@@ por@@ ts will r@@ ise , because the pr@@ ice of agricultural ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als used by the ch@@ em@@ ical industry will , de f@@ ac@@ to , be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed to world market pr@@ ic@@ es , that is , free @-@ por@@ t pr@@ ic@@ es in the Union .
as ex@@ p@@ res@@ s@@ ly re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed when these measures were dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed , the Commission is c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y monitoring the market , including the ex@@ por@@ t market , and the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y situation in this sector .
I thank the Commissioner for his an@@ s@@ w@@ er but would ask the Commission to ex@@ pla@@ in the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous lack of co@@ h@@ er@@ ence between its and the Council &apos;s p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally dec@@ la@@ red will to promote the b@@ i@@ o@@ te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical industry and the measures taken , which en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ er the very ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence of this industry .
may I point out to the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member that the question at issue here is the terms on which European industry ob@@ ta@@ in@@ s the ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als which it u@@ se@@ s to man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture specific in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al products .
in th@@ e@@ or@@ y , our st@@ ar@@ ting point is the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of European industry , and it is com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve if it can ob@@ ta@@ in the ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als which it pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses on the same terms as the re@@ st of the world .
I f@@ a@@ i@@ l to see why any ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al aid should be n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , we can only support the agricultural as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of this whole question with our organisations of the agricultural mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
we are not here to use funds e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture to support the ch@@ em@@ ical industry .
it is our j@@ o@@ b , in line with the objectives of the Treaty , to support the agricultural as@@ p@@ ec@@ t , i@@ .@@ e@@ . to give European farmers the ch@@ ance to get the products which they pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce on to the market .
I do not think that there is a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence of opinion on the question whether we would like to see a ch@@ em@@ ical industry su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised on the basis of the agricultural policy .
what is important , however - as trans@@ p@@ i@@ red last year - is that on the basis of the b@@ u@@ d@@ get dis@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations , and other con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations , this op@@ tion was not available for a while .
that is point one .
point two is that industry has been making d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t no@@ is@@ es to the effect that the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es are for@@ m@@ ing an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , and so are costs in@@ c@@ ur@@ red in pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing . these aspects very much form part of the European agricultural policy .
al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e this , it cannot be d@@ en@@ i@@ ed that pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers of v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ ble products in the European Union are going through a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h time at the moment .
in that s@@ en@@ se , every k@@ il@@ o@@ gra@@ m of ex@@ t@@ r@@ a s@@ al@@ e to the ch@@ em@@ ical industry is a welcome b@@ on@@ us , especially when pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers can pro@@ ve that they are having to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce against a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er c@@ o@@ s@@ t pr@@ ice after all .
I would still like to ask the Commissioner , based on a real c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ pr@@ ice an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s for com@@ p@@ an@@ ies in Europe and el@@ se@@ where , also taking into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation the g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c@@ ally mo@@ di@@ fied as@@ p@@ ec@@ t , to again c@@ a@@ st a c@@ r@@ it@@ ical e@@ y@@ e over whether these re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the sc@@ op@@ e of ac@@ tive im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement could not , in fact , be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed more for@@ c@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly .
y@@ es , of course we can ch@@ ec@@ k if there is any other s@@ al@@ es p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al , but I must st@@ res@@ s that certain l@@ im@@ its must be k@@ e@@ p@@ t to , even in the area of agricultural aid because , in the fin@@ al an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , all the products being ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed here , su@@ g@@ a@@ r and st@@ ar@@ ch al@@ i@@ k@@ e , are subject to quotas and aid is g@@ r@@ an@@ ted within the framework of those quotas .
we cannot su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ise more h@@ u@@ ge qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities now because we do not have the funds .
aid to ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture must be g@@ r@@ an@@ ted within the framework of the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m quotas agreed in the organisations of the market .
we cannot simply ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the quotas .

if not , why is the Commission against a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated approach ?
part I@@ I
Mr President , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , we need to di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ate in our as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the financial re@@ per@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons of the B@@ S@@ E crisis between v@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ary measures , Community measures taken within the context of the common organisation of the market in be@@ e@@ f and national measures .
as far as Community action in this area is concerned , may I draw the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member &apos;s attention to the s@@ er@@ ies of measures rec@@ ently in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed to support the be@@ e@@ f market .
both aid for p@@ ri@@ va@@ te st@@ or@@ age and public in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion have been in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed and are being f@@ un@@ d@@ ed 1@@ 00 % by the Community .
a special c@@ ul@@ ling regulation for an@@ im@@ als over th@@ ir@@ ty m@@ on@@ th@@ s ol@@ d has also been in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
S@@ e@@ v@@ ent@@ y per c@@ ent of the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of the an@@ i@@ ma@@ l is pa@@ i@@ d for by the Community , while Member States are re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to pa@@ y the other 3@@ 0 % , together with the c@@ ul@@ ling costs .
any Member State which in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to take national measures must , of course , report them to the Commission and the Commission con@@ st@@ an@@ tly ch@@ ec@@ ks what is going on in order to dis@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tions of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
any Member State w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to g@@ r@@ an@@ t aid in order to m@@ it@@ i@@ g@@ ate the consequences of the B@@ S@@ E crisis must no@@ ti@@ fy the Commission of the aid ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 8@@ 8 , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 3 , of the Treaty - as I have already mentioned - so that they can be ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed to ensure that they com@@ p@@ ly with Community framework ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents .
Commissioner , all of this is , of course , m@@ u@@ si@@ c to my e@@ ar@@ s .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , I would like to thank you for your res@@ p@@ on@@ se and the c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication as well as the d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion you have d@@ ra@@ w@@ n between national measures on the one hand and Community measures on the other .
in practice , however , I have no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed that all h@@ el@@ l has b@@ ro@@ k@@ en l@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e , not just in my own country but - I as@@ su@@ me - in other countries too .
our own regional Minister for A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture in the F@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ers R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on , Mrs D@@ u@@ a , has mentioned le@@ v@@ i@@ es on m@@ e@@ at .
others have mo@@ o@@ ted the idea of an increase in V@@ A@@ T , others still would like to pa@@ s@@ s the b@@ u@@ c@@ k to Europe .
all I can see is a great deal of c@@ ha@@ o@@ s and in@@ security in my country .
despite the fact that , ap@@ par@@ ently , the Commission will have to be no@@ ti@@ fied of such measures , there is a great deal of concern a@@ m@@ on@@ g farmers , and also a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st those in the m@@ e@@ at @-@ pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing industry , and certainly a@@ m@@ on@@ g our local b@@ u@@ t@@ ch@@ er sh@@ op@@ s , who , at the end of the day , will have to take the first b@@ l@@ o@@ w .
would it indeed not be pre@@ f@@ er@@ able to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise the com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion or the way in which the costs will be m@@ e@@ t , at the time that all te@@ st@@ s need to be carried out , in ad@@ v@@ ance rather than a@@ f@@ ter@@ w@@ ar@@ ds , th@@ us r@@ ul@@ ing out any d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tion of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition ?
your res@@ p@@ on@@ se in this matter is s@@ om@@ e@@ what dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing , in my opinion .
Mr President , the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member may well be dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted with my re@@ p@@ ly but if what he sa@@ y@@ s is cor@@ rec@@ t , i@@ .@@ e@@ . that st@@ a@@ te@@ ments by local p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans have c@@ a@@ u@@ sed con@@ f@@ u@@ sion in his region , in F@@ l@@ an@@ d@@ ers , then it is up to the same local p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the matter .
they cannot ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the European Commission to do it for them .
I have one more com@@ ment to make on a point that was raised .
where , as the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member mentioned , a Member State in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es f@@ is@@ c@@ al or par@@ a@@ f@@ is@@ c@@ al measures , such as v@@ al@@ u@@ e ad@@ ded tax sur@@ ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es , then any such measures must , of course , be taken within the framework of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing legislation , i@@ .@@ e@@ . they must be com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with European tax directives , and any measures taken must be ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed by the Commission acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
but it is also the j@@ o@@ b and the responsibility of the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States to an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ ce regional measures .
in other words , Member States must not only an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ ce measures taken at national level ; they must make k@@ no@@ w@@ n and report all measures taken .

as from 1 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , the Community has therefore b@@ an@@ n@@ ed all sh@@ i@@ p@@ ments of ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous w@@ a@@ st@@ es to be used for ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al rec@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ ing or to be de@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ited in countries ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the O@@ E@@ C@@ D .
the Community therefore com@@ p@@ li@@ es with the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 amendment to the B@@ as@@ le C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion which has not yet come into force in@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally .
this legislation is not , however , ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to ex@@ por@@ ts of w@@ a@@ st@@ e from the Swedish min@@ ing com@@ p@@ an@@ y , B@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ en to C@@ h@@ il@@ e during the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s because Sweden was not an EU Member at that time .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of the B@@ as@@ le C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion did not apply in the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
in this specific case , the Commission b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that there is no Community legislation which can now make the com@@ p@@ an@@ y li@@ able for possible environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge due to these w@@ a@@ st@@ e products .
the issue of B@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ en &apos; s li@@ ability in this case therefore re@@ ma@@ in@@ s a national issue which must be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed through national environmental legislation .
thank you for your an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
I n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate that this is how matters st@@ and , that is to say that there is not at present any legislation which may be used in this context .
n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , what we have here is an example of an un@@ u@@ su@@ ally c@@ y@@ n@@ ical trade in which ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous w@@ a@@ st@@ e that c@@ a@@ u@@ ses serious il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses , especially a@@ m@@ on@@ g children in the area , is ex@@ por@@ ted to a country which is un@@ able to deal with it .
my question is : if something si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r were to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en today , that is to say if an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t were made to ex@@ por@@ t w@@ a@@ st@@ e in this way , would the rules mean that ex@@ por@@ ts of this kind were to@@ t@@ ally b@@ an@@ n@@ ed ?
the an@@ s@@ w@@ er to that question is y@@ es .
there is currently a b@@ an on ex@@ por@@ ting ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous w@@ a@@ st@@ e , including to third countries , that is to say non @-@ EU countries .

ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions have been su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted by ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical organisations , who com@@ pla@@ in that many of the wor@@ ks pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed under the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e will a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t areas dec@@ la@@ red as s@@ it@@ es of Community interest by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government , s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ing pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies , by trade uni@@ ons and farmers &apos; as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations , who st@@ res@@ s the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve aspects of the plan and pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , and by many local authorities , who have d@@ ra@@ w@@ n attention to the in@@ con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ate pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing of some of the di@@ ver@@ si@@ ons and their social and economic consequences for people li@@ v@@ ing in the areas concerned .
all these social ag@@ ents have ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed the wish that the Commission should take up a position on the plan and should con@@ ta@@ c@@ t the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government ur@@ g@@ ing it to cor@@ rec@@ t its n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve aspects .
can the Commission s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy its position on the matter and say what con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons it d@@ ra@@ ws from any con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts it has had with the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government to d@@ ate in relation to the plan ?
Mr President , at the initiative of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Minister , Mr M@@ a@@ ta@@ s , we held a meeting where he p@@ res@@ en@@ ted the main el@@ em@@ ents of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish d@@ ra@@ f@@ t plan h@@ i@@ d@@ r@@ ol@@ ó@@ g@@ ic@@ o n@@ ac@@ i@@ on@@ al .
the plan is , at this stage , a d@@ ra@@ f@@ t which is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to be subject to mo@@ di@@ f@@ ic@@ ations following the w@@ i@@ d@@ e con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion under way in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers .
the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Minister for the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment has con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed his commitment to this con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion .
at the meeting , I b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to the attention of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish authorities the need to ensure full respect for all re@@ le@@ v@@ ant E@@ C environmental legislation and policy including the w@@ a@@ ter framework directive .
this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es both to the for@@ ma@@ l ad@@ op@@ tion procedure of the fin@@ al plan as well as the implementation p@@ ha@@ se .
the plan re@@ ma@@ in@@ s a d@@ ra@@ f@@ t d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment and at the request of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment Minister my services are currently ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t plan .
y@@ es , Commissioner , it is a d@@ ra@@ f@@ t d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , and you know that it will s@@ o@@ on be going through the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Parliament .
con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing that this d@@ ra@@ f@@ t , as p@@ res@@ en@@ ted , in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ es specific European directives , both the ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s directive and the w@@ il@@ d b@@ ir@@ ds directive , and also the objectives of the w@@ a@@ ter framework directive , my question is this : if the fin@@ al law still in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ es these directives , if it is h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful to the environment , will it rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed EUR 1 3@@ 00 b@@ il@@ li@@ on in resources from Community funds ?
of course the whole process that we have now st@@ ar@@ ted of con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion and dialogue with the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government on this particular case means that we in@@ t@@ end to get all the information necessary for us to be well in@@ for@@ m@@ ed about this process and to make sure that the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government com@@ p@@ li@@ es with the legislation .
you have already i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied some of the directives a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by this .
if there were a b@@ re@@ ac@@ h of the environmental legislation , we could actually w@@ i@@ th@@ h@@ ol@@ d pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t money .
it is very important that today we have this p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility and , of course , we should not hand out money for a Member State to b@@ re@@ ac@@ h environmental legislation .
we plan to st@@ a@@ y in t@@ ou@@ ch with the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government to make sure that their pl@@ ans are in line with the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing directives .
I believe that the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish h@@ y@@ d@@ r@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical plan - at this stage there cannot be the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ te@@ st d@@ ou@@ b@@ t of this - is an essential pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t for our country .
this has , until now , been the opinion s@@ ha@@ red by al@@ most all S@@ p@@ an@@ ish political groups over the years .
in fact , in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 , the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t government was already aware of this need and d@@ re@@ w up a proposal which at the time it either could not or did not know how to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y forward .
t@@ r@@ u@@ e , that proposal con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed an ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ab@@ ly l@@ ar@@ g@@ er number of in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res than the current pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
of course , the years have pa@@ s@@ sed and the current pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t has to be co@@ h@@ er@@ ent , in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing much more social cohesion than those that have g@@ one before , being much more en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve , and un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly in@@ v@@ it@@ ing more participation .
Mr President , at this stage , of course , what we are doing is having an ex@@ change of information .
we make sure that we are well in@@ for@@ m@@ ed about what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing in S@@ pa@@ in .
I can only re@@ p@@ e@@ at that the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Minister of E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment has con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed his commitment to this con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion process and I know that this is what is going on at the moment and that there is a debate - as I understand , a he@@ ated debate - on this issue .
so far , since the plan is not fin@@ al@@ is@@ ed we have been as@@ k@@ ed for some ad@@ v@@ ice and gu@@ i@@ d@@ ance , and this is what we can d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er at the moment : to st@@ a@@ y in a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine dialogue with the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government and to make sure that the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion process is carried out as it should be .
question No 3@@ 2 by ( H @-@ 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 / 00 ) :
subject : action being taken by the Commission to increase co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of f@@ ir@@ e protection in EU Member States T@@ he EU &apos;s st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es for f@@ ir@@ e safety are in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate .
in particular , recent dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers such as the t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l f@@ ir@@ e in A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a as well as e@@ ar@@ li@@ er fi@@ res in re@@ st@@ a@@ ur@@ an@@ ts , h@@ o@@ te@@ l@@ s and sh@@ i@@ p@@ s , et@@ c@@ . h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the importance of better co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of f@@ ir@@ e safety policy in the EU .
in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion between the Member States means that common st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es need to be i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in these areas of f@@ ir@@ e safety as well .
at the Commission , there is to my k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge no co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ a@@ tes and no Commissioner se@@ em@@ s to have over@@ all responsibility for these issues .
f@@ ir@@ e safety t@@ ou@@ ch@@ es on many policy areas such as t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , environmental and con@@ su@@ m@@ er issues , transport n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks , et@@ c .
people must be able to feel sa@@ f@@ e w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er they are in the EU .
what action is the Commission taking to increase the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of f@@ ir@@ e protection st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es in EU Member States ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is well aware that people have di@@ ed and been in@@ j@@ u@@ red as a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of fi@@ res - a fact it de@@ e@@ p@@ ly re@@ g@@ re@@ ts - and we ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y to the re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
the Commission also re@@ g@@ re@@ ts the environmental and economic d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by fi@@ res .
this issue is particularly important in the present situation in view of the fi@@ res which o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red at C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds and in C@@ h@@ in@@ a and in which many young people di@@ ed .
the Commission b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that it is very important to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate f@@ ir@@ e safety issues .
im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed f@@ ir@@ e safety within the Community , especially f@@ ir@@ e pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion , is a high @-@ priority issue in the programme of Community measures in favour of civil protection .
I can also te@@ l@@ l you that the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al for E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise has rec@@ ently in@@ it@@ i@@ ated an in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation into f@@ ir@@ e safety in the European Union in relation to b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s under con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion .
this in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation is a@@ im@@ ed at im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of b@@ u@@ il@@ ding st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds so that b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s throughout the Union might f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l the same safety re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
the b@@ u@@ il@@ ding products directive la@@ y@@ s down essential re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for all t@@ y@@ p@@ es of con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , including t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ el@@ s .
in c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cooperation with the Member States , the Commission is also as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the consequences of the Council &apos; s re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on f@@ ir@@ e safety in ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing h@@ o@@ te@@ l@@ s .
in this area , the Commission pl@@ ans to su@@ b@@ m@@ it a report to the European Parliament and the Council during the first h@@ al@@ f of this year .
it should also be b@@ or@@ n@@ e in mind that the Member States can establish their own safety re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments and that f@@ ir@@ e pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion measures ma@@ in@@ ly come within the Member States &apos; area of com@@ p@@ et@@ ence .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , this is an all @-@ em@@ b@@ ra@@ c@@ ing problem of which Community policy ta@@ k@@ es account in a v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of areas with a view to com@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing measures adopted in the Member States .
there may still be certain w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses when it comes to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating f@@ ir@@ e safety issues .
in order to get to g@@ ri@@ p@@ s with this problem and improve co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation , my own D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al &apos; s civil protection di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , together with the com@@ p@@ et@@ ent di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in the areas of industry , health and con@@ su@@ m@@ er protection , set up a working par@@ ty last O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er including re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of different b@@ r@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the em@@ er@@ g@@ ency services .
I really must thank you for your an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , a good deal of progress has n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s been made in this area .
I have no in@@ t@@ en@@ tion w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever of re@@ mo@@ v@@ ing responsibility for these f@@ ir@@ e safety issues from national or local authorities . the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity must , of course , apply in this area , just as in other areas .
I ask this question par@@ tly against the b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d of the n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons I have had with fi@@ re@@ m@@ en and their trade uni@@ ons , who are quite wor@@ ri@@ ed .
just like the public , they are , in fact , a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted more and more by c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s .
fi@@ re@@ m@@ en have to work with ever more v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s , v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es and products from countries with which they are un@@ f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r and w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e levels of f@@ ir@@ e protection they are not used to .
people tra@@ v@@ e@@ l more and more and n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally want to be able to feel sa@@ f@@ e ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of what country they are in when they take a f@@ er@@ r@@ y , tra@@ v@@ e@@ l through a t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l or go to a dis@@ co@@ th@@ e@@ qu@@ e .
against this b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d , I believe it is especially important not only for each D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate to deal with these f@@ ir@@ e safety issues but also for there to be real co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation where this st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c common responsibility is concerned .
I in@@ ter@@ pre@@ t the Commissioner &apos; s st@@ a@@ te@@ ment here to the effect that there is now just such a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating working par@@ ty as a st@@ e@@ p in that di@@ rec@@ tion and , that being the case , I should just like to thank her for her an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
it is , of course , e@@ as@@ y for me to agree with Mr F@@ ä@@ r@@ m about these v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ points . there ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be a way in to these issues in the Commission too .
however , it is not en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly e@@ as@@ y because we are also de@@ al@@ ing with st@@ a@@ tes of a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s which di@@ f@@ f@@ er con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly from one country to another and in which systems are often de@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ed to the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st possible de@@ g@@ re@@ e to local level .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , it can be difficult to issue re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations and still more difficult to issue a directive which would , as it were , be ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able e@@ ver@@ y@@ where and c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy all these various aspects .
as I said in my first s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , we are n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate matters as far as we can .
we are also t@@ r@@ ying to see if we can ob@@ ta@@ in si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds in all Member States and ensure that we co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate our own efforts .
a l@@ o@@ t can be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed now that we have a civil protection di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally with over@@ all responsibility of this kind .
we must continue with the s@@ om@@ e@@ what la@@ b@@ or@@ i@@ ous process of re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ing special pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons re@@ la@@ ting to b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s under con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , dis@@ co@@ th@@ e@@ qu@@ es , bo@@ at@@ s and what have you , with a view to en@@ sur@@ ing that we become better and more effective at co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating our f@@ ir@@ e pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion efforts .
may I draw the Commissioner &apos;s attention , as on other o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons I have d@@ ra@@ w@@ n Parliament &apos;s attention to the fact that , in cases of dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers such as f@@ ir@@ e , f@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d or e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e , what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed is f@@ a@@ st State in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the problem and , more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , sa@@ ve li@@ v@@ es .
local authorities can n@@ e@@ v@@ er man@@ age on their own .
what we need is a c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation plan between all the local res@@ c@@ u@@ e un@@ its so that , if one country su@@ f@@ f@@ ers an e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e , f@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d or f@@ ir@@ e , the for@@ c@@ es from all the countries which are not a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted can r@@ u@@ s@@ h to the sc@@ en@@ e and at least sa@@ ve li@@ v@@ es .
have you con@@ si@@ de@@ red this as an idea which could be pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted with good results ?
as the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member points out , these issues of civil protection and civil de@@ f@@ ence are very important .
we therefore have a plan in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d opportunities for the Commission to , for example , ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge j@@ o@@ in@@ t ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es for em@@ er@@ g@@ ency services and con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to civil protection from different Member States .
we also have better co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation within the Commission in order to be able to come up di@@ rec@@ tly with the information n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed and , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es too , with the special initiatives and special for@@ c@@ es n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in order to help , de@@ pen@@ ding upon what kind of acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent , dis@@ a@@ st@@ er or natural c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he may be involved .
when I v@@ is@@ ited B@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ an@@ y , I ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ated for m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f that there was a need for a uni@@ t , or s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , with responsibility for c@@ le@@ an@@ ing and w@@ a@@ sh@@ ing b@@ ir@@ ds a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by o@@ i@@ l s@@ l@@ ic@@ ks .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y that kind of s@@ er@@ v@@ ice which ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed into .
where is it to be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d ?
how shall we be able to mo@@ b@@ il@@ ise it qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly when it is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed ?
and how can we tra@@ in ourselves to be able to re@@ ac@@ t still more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly ?
the plan and the proposal already ex@@ is@@ t .
we also have to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate our em@@ er@@ g@@ ency te@@ a@@ m@@ s .
I believe we have made some good progress .
it is now also a question of al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ating enough resources to make the plan really work in practice .

every w@@ e@@ t place is a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted , including , as far as L@@ o@@ ir@@ e @-@ A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ ti@@ qu@@ e is concerned , the B@@ ri@@ è@@ r@@ e , B@@ ri@@ v@@ e@@ t , G@@ ou@@ la@@ in@@ e , and R@@ ed@@ on mar@@ sh@@ es , the G@@ r@@ and L@@ i@@ e@@ u la@@ k@@ e , the M@@ a@@ z@@ er@@ ol@@ l@@ es pla@@ in@@ s , and so for@@ th .
the pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w is now s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing extremely ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly and , despite the efforts of n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , can no longer be con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed by u@@ pro@@ o@@ t@@ ing .
the re@@ su@@ l@@ ting situation is p@@ o@@ s@@ ing a serious ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical problem and g@@ re@@ at@@ ly in@@ con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing those ent@@ it@@ led to use the land .
what technical and financial measures will the Commission take to h@@ al@@ t this n@@ u@@ is@@ ance ?
Mr President , this question concerns the pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w .
this particular pl@@ ant , as the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member has mentioned , is a particular problem in w@@ et@@ l@@ an@@ ds and the management of w@@ et@@ l@@ an@@ ds , is of course the responsibility of the Member States .
however the Commission can help in two w@@ a@@ y@@ s .
firstly , within the l@@ im@@ its of its re@@ m@@ it , it can encourage an ex@@ change of information between local pla@@ y@@ ers who have the same problem .
you may for example be aware of the initiatives taken by the Mediterranean E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment A@@ g@@ ency or by the L@@ an@@ d@@ es general c@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l , A@@ c@@ qu@@ it@@ a@@ in@@ e region , which rec@@ ently or@@ g@@ an@@ ised a meeting on how to man@@ age the pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w .
secondly , Community funds , in particular the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds , and the L@@ I@@ F@@ E in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment could be used to aid the management of the pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w in respect of N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a 2000 s@@ it@@ es .
it would , of course , be up to ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ an@@ ts to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e actions in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l rules of el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ bility .
I l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ed c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y and I would like to thank you for your an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
I would also have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to know if it would be possible to g@@ r@@ an@@ t this pl@@ ant &apos; h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful &apos; or &apos; of no market v@@ al@@ u@@ e &apos; st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s because the problem with the pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w is that it is s@@ ol@@ d w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y for use in a@@ qu@@ ar@@ i@@ a and when people get ri@@ d of their t@@ an@@ ks it e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ es into the environment , c@@ a@@ using these problems .
if we could , therefore , b@@ an it from s@@ al@@ e , I believe that this would help to st@@ o@@ p it s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing .
it is still within the com@@ p@@ et@@ ence of the Member States and , of course , they have to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e what to do or what kind of action to take .
it would be very ra@@ d@@ ical to t@@ r@@ y to b@@ an a certain pl@@ ant .
that cannot be done .
any action and any pl@@ ans have to start at local level .
what we can do is to provide some ad@@ v@@ ice and l@@ in@@ ks to others who have the same problem .
Mr President , we are always so sur@@ pr@@ ised when the b@@ al@@ ance of nature is u@@ p@@ set .
what I should like to ask is whether we could in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate why the b@@ al@@ ance has been u@@ p@@ set under European re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch programmes ?
I wish I could an@@ s@@ w@@ er that question .
I can say that the right way to deal with this problem of the L@@ u@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ a g@@ r@@ an@@ di@@ f@@ l@@ or@@ a , which is its L@@ at@@ in n@@ a@@ me , is to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s this during the technical d@@ a@@ y@@ s which are being or@@ g@@ an@@ ised on 2@@ 3 and 2@@ 4 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
it is a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence for those who are concerned about these things .
perhaps you will be able to get some more information about this pr@@ im@@ ro@@ se w@@ il@@ l@@ o@@ w and the way it has s@@ pre@@ a@@ d in an un@@ natural way .
that is the only ad@@ v@@ ice I can give today .

subject : as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report by the U@@ K N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions In@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate on B@@ N@@ F@@ L H@@ as the Commission as@@ se@@ s@@ sed the in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report pre@@ pa@@ red by the U@@ K N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions In@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate on progress made by B@@ N@@ F@@ L in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents N@@ I@@ I re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in safety and management st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res at S@@ el@@ la@@ field , in so far as the op@@ er@@ ations at S@@ el@@ la@@ field ad@@ ver@@ s@@ el@@ y a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t other Member States ?
in F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary 2000 the N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions In@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate , the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y b@@ od@@ y , pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed a report on aspects re@@ la@@ ting to the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of B@@ r@@ it@@ ish N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r F@@ u@@ el@@ s L@@ im@@ ited at the S@@ el@@ la@@ field P@@ l@@ ant .
this B@@ r@@ it@@ ish re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y b@@ od@@ y rec@@ ently pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed a re@@ v@@ is@@ ed in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report on the progress made by B@@ N@@ F@@ L .
following the F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations , the Commission &apos; s services are also st@@ u@@ d@@ ying this second in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report .
in addition , the Commission k@@ no@@ ws that , since the re@@ v@@ is@@ ed report was pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y b@@ od@@ y has been sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with the way in which B@@ N@@ F@@ L has de@@ al@@ t , for example , with the 1@@ 5 re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations in the report specific to the d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tion pl@@ ant , and that these re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations have been c@@ l@@ o@@ sed , as they say in the n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r industry , which means they are con@@ si@@ de@@ red to have been com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with .
the Commission ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es that the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y b@@ od@@ y ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ tes the e@@ f@@ for@@ t and commitment dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed by B@@ N@@ F@@ L with respect to its concerns and also that si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant progress has been made ( I am qu@@ o@@ t@@ ing di@@ rec@@ tly ) regarding its other re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations in the F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary report .
much still re@@ ma@@ in@@ s to be done , however , since in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 only 3 of the in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tion te@@ am &apos; s 2@@ 8 re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations had been for@@ m@@ ally c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y b@@ od@@ y has rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised that many of the measures already in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by the com@@ p@@ an@@ y will still need time to take effect fully .
in the words of the N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions In@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate , B@@ r@@ it@@ ish N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r F@@ u@@ el@@ s L@@ im@@ ited has made a good start , but it must k@@ e@@ e@@ p up the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of change while it con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to op@@ er@@ ate its pl@@ an@@ ts sa@@ f@@ el@@ y .
Mrs A@@ h@@ er@@ n , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ tes the progress made and s@@ ha@@ res the in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ s &apos; de@@ si@@ r@@ e to see a st@@ e@@ ad@@ y d@@ ri@@ ve towards an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed safety c@@ ul@@ ture at all levels of management , and , of course , within my com@@ p@@ et@@ ences , or rather in this field , my non @-@ com@@ p@@ et@@ ences , I shall k@@ e@@ e@@ p a w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing b@@ ri@@ e@@ f on what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing at S@@ el@@ la@@ field .
I wish to thank Mrs de P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o for st@@ u@@ d@@ ying the situation and for sa@@ ying that she was k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing a w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing b@@ ri@@ e@@ f .
however , I cannot agree that com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with 3 out of 20 re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations is progress .
it certainly is not .
in the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y , the ch@@ i@@ e@@ f in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ to@@ r of the U@@ K N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions In@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate said quite clearly that he would s@@ h@@ u@@ t the re@@ pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity if the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations were not com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with in full .
clearly they have not been com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with in full .
we can ar@@ gu@@ e about progress being s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ t or s@@ l@@ o@@ w , but we have to see com@@ p@@ li@@ ance in full .
I hope Mrs de P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o that you will state here today that you wish to see com@@ p@@ li@@ ance in full with the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations and s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ tly , because that is what I want to he@@ a@@ r .
I also re@@ f@@ er@@ red to the ad@@ ver@@ se a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts on other Member States , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the R@@ e@@ public of I@@ re@@ land , and would like to draw the Commissioner &apos;s attention to a report pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed by the R@@ a@@ di@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te of I@@ re@@ land in December 2000 , which is c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of em@@ is@@ si@@ ons from S@@ el@@ la@@ field and their ad@@ ver@@ se effect on the R@@ e@@ public of I@@ re@@ land .
I would ask you to st@@ u@@ d@@ y that in full also , Mrs de P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o .
of course I shall ask st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t a@@ way for this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment that you have mentioned to be an@@ al@@ y@@ sed too , if it is not being ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed already , and if we do not have it , which would be st@@ r@@ an@@ ge , may I ask you to provide us with a c@@ op@@ y .
in any case , we would , of course , like to see com@@ p@@ li@@ ance as s@@ o@@ on as possible with all the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations - not just 3 , but all 2@@ 8 - on the part of B@@ r@@ it@@ ish N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r F@@ u@@ el@@ s in its op@@ er@@ ations and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities at S@@ el@@ la@@ field , and it is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous that if it does not c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out all these re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations , as the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish Government has already said , they will have to take decisions in that respect .
I must re@@ mind you that what I can under@@ take to do , as I have already said , is to k@@ e@@ e@@ p a very c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e w@@ at@@ ch , but com@@ p@@ et@@ ences in this field are still national , and I know that the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish authorities are taking a very f@@ ir@@ m st@@ and on this whole question .
I tabled a question to the Commission in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er on the environmental ha@@ z@@ ar@@ ds p@@ o@@ sed by D@@ U , depleted uranium 2@@ 3@@ 8 , sh@@ el@@ l@@ s in the Balkans and su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed that some of the em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge to S@@ er@@ b@@ i@@ a should be d@@ ed@@ ic@@ ated to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ating and , if pro@@ v@@ en , making good the to@@ x@@ ic and ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly p@@ o@@ sed to the people of K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
Commissioner P@@ att@@ en rather sur@@ pr@@ is@@ in@@ g@@ ly re@@ p@@ li@@ ed that this was not a priority .
in view of the recent EU @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ity and concerns ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed about D@@ U sh@@ el@@ l@@ s and the ha@@ z@@ ar@@ ds p@@ o@@ sed by the d@@ u@@ st in particular if in@@ h@@ al@@ ed by s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers and c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans , particularly children pla@@ ying in the v@@ ic@@ in@@ ity of where there has been b@@ om@@ b d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge , have the Commissioner &apos;s v@@ i@@ e@@ ws ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed since then ?
the question on B@@ r@@ it@@ ish N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r F@@ u@@ el@@ s L@@ im@@ ited is not re@@ le@@ v@@ ant and not su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y and therefore la@@ p@@ ses .

subject : m@@ od@@ al sh@@ i@@ f@@ t from road transport to ra@@ i@@ l transport and c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t is of en@@ or@@ m@@ ous re@@ le@@ v@@ ance to the debate on c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change , as it is the s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of 2@@ 6 % of the current C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ si@@ ons where road transport ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for 8@@ 4 % of all transport .
recent f@@ o@@ rec@@ a@@ st@@ s su@@ g@@ g@@ est that transport is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce with the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est increase ra@@ te in C@@ O@@ 2 em@@ is@@ si@@ ons in the next few years .
li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of ra@@ i@@ l f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport and in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d in@@ te@@ ro@@ per@@ ability of the ra@@ i@@ l system are important but in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent st@@ e@@ p@@ s towards the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of ra@@ i@@ l transport , the most important al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve transport m@@ od@@ e to road .
how is the Commission pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to support in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in ra@@ i@@ l transport , ma@@ in@@ ly within the framework of the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , G@@ u@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es for the T@@ E@@ N@@ S , and the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er on U@@ r@@ b@@ an T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t ?
is the Commission pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to re@@ view current priority or non @-@ priority road projects within the T@@ E@@ N@@ s framework so as to give pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence to more su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able transport m@@ od@@ es ?
can the Commission in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate the share of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment per m@@ od@@ e of transport in the framework of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds &apos; P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ing P@@ er@@ i@@ o@@ d 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 ?
at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of next m@@ on@@ th the Commission ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ts to ap@@ pro@@ ve a W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on the common transport policy , which will be ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed by a re@@ view of gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es on the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European transport n@@ et@@ work and p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly other initiatives to promote less p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ting and more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent transport systems .
these initiatives are in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to com@@ b@@ at g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion , n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve environmental effects , our over @-@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence on o@@ i@@ l and the high number of road accidents .
the Commission is d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up a set of economic measures re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res to favour greater use of those transport m@@ od@@ es that still have available c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity and are less h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful to the environment .
the in@@ t@@ en@@ ded a@@ i@@ m is to give a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es and to encourage greater cooperation between transport m@@ od@@ es .
to this end , the re@@ view of t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks will be carried out in two st@@ ag@@ es .
the first stage will f@@ o@@ c@@ us on a few priority to@@ p@@ ic@@ s , em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ing the en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement of ra@@ i@@ l f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport .
in the second stage , which is ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to be@@ g@@ in before 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 , a more prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d re@@ view of the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es will be con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted , l@@ o@@ o@@ king especially at the enlargement of the Union and the environment , and the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ m@@ od@@ e transport r@@ ou@@ tes will be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed .
the Commission &apos; s gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es concerning the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ d programmes for 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d that priority should be given to in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport .
the Commission will present a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation to s@@ how how these gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es have been taken into account .
I w@@ an@@ ted to ask a su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y question but I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that I am going to have to re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to the two par@@ ts of my question which have not been ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
I as@@ k@@ ed if the Commission was pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to re@@ view current priority or non @-@ priority road projects within the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks framework so as to give pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence to more su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able transport m@@ od@@ es .
that part of my question has not been an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red .
secondly , I w@@ an@@ ted the Commission to in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate the share of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment per m@@ od@@ e of transport in the framework of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds programme per@@ i@@ o@@ d 2000 to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
you may say that it is not possible , but I think you could at least give a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ te .
Mrs M@@ c@@ K@@ en@@ n@@ a , I must te@@ l@@ l you that with regard to t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks right now priority is being given de f@@ ac@@ to to ra@@ i@@ l projects , if that is what you are concerned about .
the major part - the in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments - cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ds to large ra@@ i@@ l projects .
secondly , what is in@@ t@@ en@@ ded in this W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er - in which we shall have the opportunity to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s all these issues in great de@@ p@@ th , and in which problems of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing and the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the various m@@ od@@ es of transport , et@@ c . , will also ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r - is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y to make progress in s@@ or@@ ting out bo@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ ks , which does not mean that in some cases we shall not have to think about en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ing certain road in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
what is also in@@ t@@ en@@ ded is a greater use of transport m@@ od@@ es such as ri@@ v@@ er or co@@ a@@ st@@ al transport , and what is in@@ t@@ en@@ ded , above all , is to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of the transport system , because in the end , s@@ o@@ on@@ er or la@@ ter , roads always se@@ e@@ m to come into it to guarantee the &apos; d@@ o@@ or to d@@ o@@ or &apos; f@@ ac@@ to@@ r , which is a dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve el@@ ement .
this means in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity , in@@ ter@@ con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion pla@@ t@@ for@@ m@@ s , and also in@@ te@@ ro@@ per@@ ability in f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t systems too .
as for the su@@ m@@ s for the 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 per@@ i@@ o@@ d , I f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly cannot give you the ex@@ ac@@ t fi@@ gu@@ res .
what I can te@@ l@@ l you is that at the moment more than 5@@ 0 % is already being e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for projects that have to do with the ra@@ i@@ l sector .
question No 3@@ 6 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 6@@ 3 / 00 ) :
subject : su@@ p@@ p@@ ly of energy and n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy T@@ he Commission has just adopted a G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er on the security of energy su@@ p@@ p@@ ly .
this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment g@@ i@@ v@@ es f@@ res@@ h en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement to the n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r industry , while at the same time the Commission &apos; s e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ tes su@@ g@@ g@@ est a pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the pro@@ por@@ tion of energy con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ed by n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r power , down from the current 1@@ 5 % to 6 % by 2@@ 0@@ 3@@ 0 .
civil society is re@@ j@@ ec@@ ting the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r power as an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l f@@ u@@ el@@ s .
is the Commission con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the pro@@ por@@ tion of energy con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ed by n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r power ?
if so , up to what level ? how does it think it will be able to fin@@ ance the development of r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy ?
how does it plan to use n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r industry prof@@ its as an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of funding for r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy ?
does it not consider it ad@@ v@@ is@@ able , and indeed necessary , to re@@ di@@ rec@@ t the financial resources now al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , including re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch into n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r f@@ u@@ sion , into the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy ?
qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to Mr N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on
to Mrs I@@ s@@ l@@ er B@@ é@@ gu@@ in &apos; s question on r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able and n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es , I should like to an@@ s@@ w@@ er first of all that , at the moment , the priority is to encourage an increase in the use of r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es .
let this be quite clear .
in no d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , or an@@ y@@ where el@@ se , have I s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that I favour the use of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy .
in the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er - which you can get h@@ ol@@ d of - what em@@ er@@ g@@ es quite clearly is the increase in support , in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es and all k@@ in@@ ds of b@@ ac@@ king for the use of r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es .
a result of this is the discussion on the directive on the use of g@@ re@@ en el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity - el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity from r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es - or our c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation with the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al for C@@ om@@ p@@ et@@ ition on the question of the pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing of aid to these k@@ in@@ ds of se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
secondly , the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er also pu@@ ts forward the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of using some k@@ in@@ ds of com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion or c@@ ro@@ s@@ sed su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es from the u@@ su@@ al or tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al energy s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es - co@@ al , o@@ i@@ l , g@@ as , n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy , or all of them together - to provide support for r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es .
Commissioner , the reason I ask this question is simply because my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members in the European Parliament have been working for 1@@ 5 years for r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy to be taken into account .
the Commission is be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate it , but r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy is ap@@ par@@ ently con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to be v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed as a back @-@ up su@@ p@@ p@@ ly rather than as the energy of the future .
the f@@ ac@@ ts are clear , and the view is ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed that funding is not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent , especially com@@ pa@@ red with levels of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment made in the past for other for@@ m@@ s of energy .
on the other hand , n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy and n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r @-@ based el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity , which does not pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce any g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se g@@ as , were w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted as part of the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against the g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se effect , and it was b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally as@@ s@@ er@@ ted that n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy could be seen as an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to com@@ b@@ at the g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se effect .
therefore , this is why we as@@ k@@ ed the question , to see if the Commission is still on the same w@@ a@@ v@@ el@@ en@@ g@@ th , in w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to continue to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy in both the European Union , and el@@ se@@ where in the world , and not just as a b@@ ac@@ k@@ u@@ p energy s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce .
Mrs I@@ s@@ l@@ er B@@ é@@ gu@@ in , I should l@@ o@@ ve to be able to say that we could su@@ p@@ p@@ ly all our energy re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments from r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es , but , unfortunately , at the current stage of te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical development this is not t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
our p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es in the European Union is l@@ im@@ ited , both for p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al reasons - because , a@@ part from s@@ ol@@ a@@ r power , where we could have a greater mar@@ g@@ in , the others have clear l@@ im@@ it@@ ations - and for economic reasons , because it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that we have to g@@ r@@ an@@ t aid to the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es - and I have already said that I have taken con@@ c@@ re@@ te , positive initiatives in this respect - but even so , we have to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in some level of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and b@@ al@@ ance .
ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing 1@@ 2 % of our b@@ a@@ si@@ c energy from r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es se@@ em@@ s to me to be a very a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous ta@@ r@@ get , and I am pre@@ pa@@ red to make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to re@@ ac@@ h this ta@@ r@@ get by 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 0 .
having said that , I cannot d@@ en@@ y the e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence , and the e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence is that , a@@ part from other very serious problems such as w@@ a@@ st@@ e , n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy does not in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion from any em@@ is@@ si@@ ons .
finally , I must say that the n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r problem is a very serious problem , but it is under control .
at the moment , unfortunately , the problem of c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly out of control .
it is a problem that is out of control now , and what is more , I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d it will not be con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ la@@ ble un@@ less we take major st@@ e@@ p@@ s .
I share your concern .
not only the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er on energy but also the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on transport - because transport has a l@@ o@@ t to do with this subject - take a clear line of t@@ r@@ ying to min@@ im@@ ise the effects from a c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change point of view and from an environmental point of view , while ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing development , g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and the quality of life .
thank you , Commissioner .
in your res@@ p@@ on@@ se you re@@ li@@ ed he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y on the economic ar@@ gu@@ ment , but we have to say that both n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy and co@@ al are , in fact , he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised .
as Mrs I@@ s@@ l@@ er B@@ é@@ gu@@ in said , can we see the same level of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es - look at the money s@@ p@@ ent on re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in f@@ u@@ sion - in r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es ?
to d@@ ate we do not have level of funding either from the EU or from the Member States .
I have two other points .
firstly , do you consider w@@ a@@ st@@ e in@@ c@@ in@@ er@@ ation a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , because we need c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication on that ?
secondly , where we get in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al prof@@ its as an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of funding for r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , will we see a level pla@@ ying field ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the bo@@ ar@@ d ?
I would re@@ f@@ er you also to the fact - I have said this in other for@@ a - that D@@ i@@ rec@@ to@@ r @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al L@@ a@@ m@@ ou@@ re@@ u@@ x has made st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy which va@@ st@@ ly ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed the b@@ ri@@ e@@ f of the Commission .
it is for the Member States to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e whether they will b@@ u@@ il@@ d or not b@@ u@@ il@@ d n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r power pl@@ an@@ ts .
will the Commissioner dis@@ as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ate h@@ er@@ s@@ el@@ f from those com@@ ments ?
the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er clearly st@@ a@@ tes that r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es need aid and support at the moment , as was the case some time ago with co@@ al or n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es , for in@@ st@@ ance .
at the moment , r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able en@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es need b@@ ac@@ king and to be given a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r level of support , at least - and I think they need even more .
in other words , I fully agree with you , and I say so pla@@ in@@ ly in the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er .
secondly , w@@ a@@ st@@ e as such is not r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy .
w@@ a@@ st@@ e in@@ c@@ in@@ er@@ ation by itself cannot be a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy .
but in the case of the appropriate in@@ c@@ in@@ er@@ ation of w@@ a@@ st@@ e from r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or@@ g@@ an@@ ic com@@ p@@ on@@ ents , then y@@ es , we are in the field of r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy .
you know that this was the subject of a debate in this Parliament and also that , in the end , a com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise was re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed by which we agreed to accept a particular t@@ y@@ p@@ e of w@@ a@@ st@@ e in certain res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts and under certain conditions .
but if you just say w@@ a@@ st@@ e and that is all , then I will say no .
only w@@ a@@ st@@ e con@@ si@@ de@@ red in a particular way and , of course , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fied and s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted .
with regard to Mr L@@ a@@ m@@ ou@@ re@@ u@@ x &apos; s st@@ a@@ te@@ ments , he sa@@ y@@ s what the Treaty st@@ a@@ tes , and , of course , the decision to set up a n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r power pl@@ ant or not or to op@@ t out is up to the Member States ; it is not up to the Commission and n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er is it a Community decision .
it is the Member States that take their own decisions acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to their own op@@ tions , within the general framework , of course , which does not mean that I do not believe we should think c@@ a@@ re@@ fully about it , because I believe Europe needs a common energy policy .
as the time al@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ted to qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to Commissioner de P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o has el@@ ap@@ sed , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 3@@ 7 , 3@@ 8 and 3@@ 9 will be re@@ p@@ li@@ ed to in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I want an an@@ s@@ w@@ er to my question .
you pa@@ s@@ sed over my Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion 3@@ 9 .
I am here to take the question .
I must request the an@@ s@@ w@@ er to that question .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , may I point out that in Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion 3@@ 6 there were three qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons in one , which to@@ o@@ k up over 20 min@@ u@@ tes .
there are three qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons in one in Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion 4@@ 0 , which will take another 20 min@@ u@@ tes or so .
my Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion 3@@ 9 is one si@@ m@@ p@@ le s@@ ent@@ ence and all I re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e is one si@@ m@@ p@@ le an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
I am ent@@ it@@ led to that .
I therefore ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t you , Mr President , to acc@@ or@@ d me the respect of the House and the an@@ s@@ w@@ er to my question .
I have been here for the last 1@@ 6 years and I am at least ent@@ it@@ led to the respect of the House .
Mr F@@ it@@ z@@ si@@ m@@ ons , the House has every respect for you , but the pr@@ im@@ ary d@@ u@@ ty of a Member - especially those of us who have been here for many years - is to re@@ a@@ d the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
there is an order of qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
you will understand that I have been con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ting Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion T@@ im@@ e now for a year and a h@@ al@@ f , and out of d@@ u@@ ty I have had to re@@ a@@ d this part of the R@@ ul@@ es .
each Commissioner an@@ s@@ w@@ ers for 20 min@@ u@@ tes .
your question is No 3@@ 9 .
N@@ o@@ s 3@@ 7 and 3@@ 8 did not rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve an an@@ s@@ w@@ er either in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the R@@ ul@@ es , and their a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ s were also present .
there is not going to be debate on this now , I as@@ sure you , because it would pre@@ v@@ ent Members from being able to ask their qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
so in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the R@@ ul@@ es , A@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ x I@@ I , &quot; A@@ n@@ s@@ w@@ ers to qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons &quot; , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 1@@ 1 : &quot; qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons that re@@ main un@@ an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red for lack of time shall be an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing . &quot;
that is what I have done , and I am ap@@ pl@@ ying the same r@@ u@@ le to you as to e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y el@@ se .
in other words , you are being acc@@ or@@ d@@ ed to@@ ta@@ l and ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te respect .
if you have an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se to ad@@ d , p@@ le@@ a@@ se do so in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing .
Mr T@@ an@@ no@@ c@@ k , who is re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ing a point of order , as@@ k@@ ed a question that was not re@@ le@@ v@@ ant , because it was not su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y .
this is the view of the presidency of this s@@ it@@ ting and I do not in@@ t@@ end to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s it further .
question No 4@@ 0 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 5@@ 9 / 00 ) :
subject : N@@ G@@ O@@ s and reform of development services and policy T@@ he Commission has em@@ b@@ ar@@ k@@ ed on the process of reform in the field of development policy , in the context of which the role of N@@ G@@ O@@ s will need to be defin@@ ed .
the European Parliament ar@@ gu@@ es that N@@ G@@ O@@ s are one of the p@@ il@@ l@@ ar@@ s on which Community cooperation re@@ st@@ s and is concerned at the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of N@@ G@@ O@@ s in the new gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es and e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment plan for development policy and services .
will the Commission establish a per@@ man@@ ent st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red dialogue with the European N@@ G@@ O L@@ i@@ a@@ is@@ on Committee ( C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G ) which will guarantee the terms g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing the participation of European N@@ G@@ O@@ s in Community cooperation ?
does the Commission believe that it is important to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the role of N@@ G@@ O@@ s with a view to b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ing their p@@ res@@ ence in Community development policy by com@@ par@@ is@@ on with m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ la@@ te@@ ra@@ l aid organisations , ch@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ ly those b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to the United N@@ ations family ?
will the Commission take account of the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence with N@@ G@@ O@@ s ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red by st@@ a@@ f@@ f in the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G when it d@@ ra@@ ws up the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment plan for the new im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing b@@ od@@ y ?
the Commission fully ag@@ re@@ es with the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member that N@@ G@@ O@@ s as important ac@@ t@@ or@@ s in civil society are one of the p@@ il@@ l@@ ar@@ s on which E@@ C cooperation re@@ st@@ s .
the C@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ o@@ u A@@ g@@ re@@ ement s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally m@@ en@@ tions the in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing role of non @-@ State ac@@ t@@ or@@ s in the development process .
the Commission has el@@ ab@@ or@@ ated specific pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ing gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es on the role of ac@@ t@@ or@@ s such as N@@ G@@ O@@ s in the EU par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the A@@ C@@ P countries .
the Commission action plan also con@@ ta@@ in@@ s com@@ m@@ it@@ ments to par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s with the A@@ C@@ P .
the Commission action plan also con@@ ta@@ in@@ s com@@ m@@ it@@ ments to par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s and con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion of civil society and non @-@ State ac@@ t@@ or@@ s .
as far as the European N@@ G@@ O L@@ i@@ a@@ is@@ on Committee ( C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G ) is concerned , our re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with it has always been ac@@ tive and f@@ r@@ u@@ it@@ ful .
in addition to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to N@@ G@@ O projects , projects that actually re@@ ac@@ h people in the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries , the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G is also fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally as@@ s@@ is@@ ted by the Commission .
in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with its financial rules the Commission received the pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary results of an a@@ u@@ d@@ it of the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G in December 2000 , which s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s p@@ o@@ or financial management within the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G .
the Commission will draw the consequences of this a@@ u@@ d@@ it in order to put its re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G on a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d basis .
however , it should be mentioned that the dialogue between the Commission and the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G is not and will not be in@@ ter@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ ted .
the dialogue with a number of other N@@ G@@ O@@ s and other N@@ G@@ O u@@ m@@ b@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a organisations - there is a number of them - also will be de@@ e@@ pen@@ ed over the next year as the new or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed in M@@ a@@ y 2000 comes into place .
on this matter it is important to ask you not to make the mis@@ take of th@@ in@@ king that acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting a special l@@ o@@ w@@ er st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of financial management for the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G is an a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate way by which the Commission should d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te its positive att@@ it@@ u@@ de towards the in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of civil society as such .
this is not the problem , the problem we are f@@ ac@@ ing here is simply one of financial management .
the Commission con@@ si@@ d@@ ers that N@@ G@@ O@@ s have a d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t and c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al role , which is different from and not in com@@ p@@ et@@ ition with UN ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es .
E@@ C@@ H@@ O &apos;s use of N@@ G@@ O@@ s , the UN and other organisations re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts what is best in the situation .
s@@ it@@ u@@ ations change and so does the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n of how we d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te through different par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
finally , many of the st@@ a@@ f@@ f with ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence of N@@ G@@ O@@ s in the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G have now been trans@@ f@@ er@@ red to the E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ A@@ i@@ d C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation Office - our new im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing b@@ od@@ y .
therefore they will bring their k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge to the new o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e and con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on how to h@@ an@@ d@@ le the re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p better to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce some of the problems we have had in the past with the not always very s@@ mo@@ o@@ t@@ h dialogue between the different parties .
therefore , we understand that the s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion that may be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted is not in pro@@ por@@ tion to the s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness of the ir@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ities that the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion may have com@@ m@@ it@@ ted , and that if a way out of the current situation is not f@@ ou@@ n@@ d the N@@ G@@ O L@@ i@@ a@@ is@@ on Committee may c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e .
the question is , therefore : does the Commissioner f@@ o@@ re@@ see a way out of the financial situation without p@@ rec@@ l@@ u@@ ding the fact that the Commission should then n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate a re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing or new way in which the N@@ G@@ O@@ s must work and how they must co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate themselves ?
we will make the kind of res@@ p@@ on@@ se to this problem that we have p@@ res@@ en@@ ted for the C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G so far .
let me here make the point that we are not at the fin@@ al con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , we have received the report from the Auditors and we are l@@ o@@ o@@ king at what kind of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons we will draw in the Commission .
but we have in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated - and this re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts what the Auditors are sa@@ ying - that there is a need to rec@@ over something ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d EUR 1 million .
that rec@@ o@@ very n@@ or@@ m@@ ally also le@@ ad@@ s to a st@@ o@@ p in the funding of the re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ ent in question .
this is n@@ or@@ ma@@ l procedure .
I am f@@ ac@@ ed with a situation where if I do not do this I would be ac@@ ting in a m@@ an@@ n@@ er which would in all pro@@ b@@ ability be st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised by the Court of Auditors and by this House .
I still re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er the very l@@ ou@@ d ap@@ pla@@ use I received at my he@@ ar@@ ing in the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation a year and a h@@ al@@ f ago when I said that I and this Commission would take the line of a z@@ er@@ o t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance policy re@@ la@@ ting to mis@@ management and all these problems .
e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y ag@@ re@@ es on that and what I am doing now is following n@@ or@@ ma@@ l procedures , to the ex@@ t@@ ent that we have such a th@@ ing in the Commission .
but here I am on clear g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
I am aware of the problem that Mrs S@@ a@@ u@@ qu@@ il@@ l@@ o has raised and we are doing e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing we can to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion which will allow the su@@ b@@ st@@ ance of the cooperation with the N@@ G@@ O world to continue .
but if some s@@ or@@ t of re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion is necessary , this is a p@@ ha@@ se they may have to go through .
for the time being I am very c@@ a@@ re@@ ful not to st@@ i@@ pu@@ late what the ou@@ t@@ come ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be because it is very much in the h@@ an@@ ds of the o@@ w@@ n@@ ers of C@@ L@@ O@@ N@@ G and the many different N@@ G@@ O@@ s all over Europe .
but we are not t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing our b@@ ac@@ ks on them and we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t and hope that future cooperation will be n@@ or@@ ma@@ l and f@@ r@@ u@@ it@@ ful .
question No 4@@ 1 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1 / 00 ) :
subject : aid to C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ ans d@@ ri@@ v@@ en out of the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a I@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ ds P@@ ar@@ ti@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ r attention should be d@@ ra@@ w@@ n to the per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion , v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence and ter@@ ro@@ r per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ ted against the C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an population of the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a I@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ ds in In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a by J@@ i@@ had m@@ il@@ it@@ an@@ ts , especially on the is@@ land of A@@ m@@ b@@ on , which has re@@ su@@ l@@ ted in the de@@ se@@ c@@ ra@@ tion and b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es , C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ ans being for@@ c@@ ed to f@@ le@@ e en ma@@ s@@ se , and a large number of de@@ a@@ th@@ s .
I have per@@ s@@ on@@ ally m@@ e@@ t the C@@ a@@ th@@ ol@@ ic b@@ is@@ h@@ o@@ p M@@ on@@ d@@ ag@@ i from A@@ m@@ b@@ on together with P@@ ro@@ te@@ st@@ ant ch@@ ur@@ ch le@@ ad@@ ers .
the situation is al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an Government and ar@@ my are d@@ u@@ ty @-@ b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to guarantee their citizens &apos; safety and li@@ v@@ es , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of which f@@ a@@ it@@ h they prof@@ e@@ s@@ s .
what initiatives and measures has the Commission taken to provide aid to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ ans d@@ ri@@ v@@ en from their h@@ om@@ es in the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a I@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ ds , particularly on A@@ m@@ b@@ on , in the very v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able situation in which they find themselves ?
E@@ C@@ H@@ O m@@ ou@@ n@@ ted the first op@@ er@@ ations in the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ as in M@@ ar@@ ch 1999 when an aid pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge of EUR 1 million made it possible to set up m@@ ed@@ ical health and food d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion programmes for dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed people from the A@@ m@@ b@@ on and K@@ a@@ i is@@ l@@ an@@ ds .
the financial decision for In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a was si@@ g@@ n@@ ed in December 1999 and EUR 9@@ 00 000 were used for the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of these two programmes .
two further em@@ er@@ g@@ ency op@@ er@@ ations with a b@@ u@@ d@@ get of EUR 1@@ .@@ 5 million be@@ g@@ an in M@@ ar@@ ch 2000 because the number of dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed to r@@ ise .
these op@@ er@@ ations co@@ v@@ e@@ red the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions of f@@ o@@ od@@ st@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ s and first aid and the op@@ er@@ ations also en@@ su@@ red m@@ ed@@ ical aid and a su@@ p@@ p@@ ly of d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter to the dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons from the ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
as the conflict has re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed the n@@ or@@ th of the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a is@@ l@@ an@@ ds and particularly the is@@ land of H@@ al@@ ma@@ h@@ er@@ a the two N@@ G@@ O@@ s fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed by E@@ C@@ H@@ O in A@@ m@@ b@@ on , M@@ ed@@ ec@@ in@@ s s@@ an@@ s f@@ r@@ on@@ ti@@ è@@ res , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , and A@@ c@@ tion con@@ t@@ r@@ e l@@ a f@@ a@@ i@@ m , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , have ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded their action to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons from this is@@ land .
the re@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion of v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence in M@@ a@@ y and J@@ un@@ e last year pro@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ ed new dis@@ pla@@ c@@ em@@ ents all over the ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
therefore an em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid decision for In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a was si@@ g@@ n@@ ed in A@@ u@@ gu@@ st 2000 for EUR 2 million .
it is funding a new programme of assistance for dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons with a b@@ u@@ d@@ get of EUR 6@@ 00 000 which in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of food and first aid .
world M@@ is@@ sion G@@ er@@ many is c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out this programme .
con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing that the situation in the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ as re@@ ma@@ in@@ s a cause for h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an concern , a new h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid decision of 2 m was si@@ g@@ n@@ ed on 5 December 2000 .
the decision in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t for the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s &apos; n@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al and health conditions which will be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted by A@@ c@@ tion con@@ t@@ r@@ e l@@ a f@@ a@@ i@@ m , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
it also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t a@@ im@@ ing at en@@ sur@@ ing the transport of d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter which will be carried out by the international committee of the R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ s@@ s .
so , we are g@@ i@@ v@@ ing high priority to as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing the people who are the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of this very un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate conflict .
I should like to thank Commissioner N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on for his an@@ s@@ w@@ er and for the efforts being made on behalf of all re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a I@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ ds where the l@@ ar@@ g@@ est group is de f@@ ac@@ to C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an .
we are concerned here with a to@@ ta@@ l of 3@@ 00 000 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es out of a population of 1@@ 0 million people .
it is as if all the re@@ si@@ d@@ ents of Sweden &apos; s third l@@ ar@@ g@@ est c@@ ity , M@@ al@@ m@@ ö , were to be ex@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed as re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
I also want to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the gra@@ v@@ ity of the situation for the C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an min@@ or@@ ity in In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a .
on C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s E@@ ve , a large number of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated b@@ om@@ b at@@ ta@@ c@@ ks against ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es - including the c@@ a@@ th@@ ed@@ ra@@ l in the c@@ ap@@ it@@ al , J@@ a@@ k@@ ar@@ t@@ a - to@@ o@@ k place at a v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of l@@ o@@ c@@ ations in the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an ar@@ ch@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ ago .
In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a is the world &apos; s f@@ ou@@ r@@ th l@@ ar@@ g@@ est country in terms of population , as well as being the most he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted M@@ u@@ s@@ li@@ m country .
I as@@ su@@ me you are following de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments there very c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y .
my specific question is this : are there l@@ in@@ ks with C@@ ar@@ it@@ as , the L@@ u@@ th@@ er@@ an W@@ or@@ l@@ d F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation and the W@@ or@@ l@@ d Council of C@@ h@@ ur@@ ch@@ es with a view to pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing aid to the ex@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an min@@ or@@ ity , above all in the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ a I@@ s@@ l@@ an@@ ds ?
I can an@@ s@@ w@@ er the last question by sa@@ ying that the organisations concerned are those I re@@ f@@ er@@ red to as our par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid .
I would also ad@@ d that a conflict of this kind could e@@ s@@ c@@ al@@ ate if , as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ers of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid , we were to c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e as par@@ t@@ n@@ ers to help us implement the aid , organisations which could be seen as not being n@@ e@@ u@@ tra@@ l in the conflict .
we are c@@ a@@ re@@ ful to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d this further problem .
I understand the nature of the conflict very well indeed , as well as the fe@@ el@@ in@@ g@@ s as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with the conflict because of its nature , but I believe that , in c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out the ta@@ s@@ k before us , what we are doing is right .
this aid is very la@@ u@@ d@@ able on the one hand , but , could it not also be l@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an Government o@@ f@@ f the h@@ o@@ o@@ k ; and should we really not use the political and economic st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th of the European Union to force the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an Government to look after its own citizens , especially this C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an min@@ or@@ ity ?
there are a number of con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts within In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a .
they are not all of the same ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter .
this one is different from those con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts that have ar@@ is@@ en from the issue of se@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion , s@@ pl@@ it@@ t@@ ing up In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a .
in fact , we are co@@ op@@ er@@ ating with the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an Government , t@@ r@@ ying not only to in@@ s@@ is@@ t but also to ur@@ ge them in a co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve s@@ p@@ ir@@ it to do what a government ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to do in h@@ an@@ d@@ ling a problem of this ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter .
there is , in my view , a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence between this conflict and the other con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a and also some di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter of the res@@ p@@ on@@ se of the In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ an Government .
here there is the basis of re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y good cooperation with the Government of In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a .
but the conflict itself is extremely n@@ a@@ st@@ y and very pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c for e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y , especially the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of course .
I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to in@@ for@@ m the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member and this House that the Commission has taken and con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to take appropriate measures in relation to the n@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ ition and re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation situation of B@@ ur@@ un@@ di@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a .
I v@@ is@@ ited T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a in M@@ ar@@ ch 2000 and on that o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion I also w@@ ent to see c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s with re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es from B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i .
the over@@ all number of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a , including those from B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i , con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to g@@ ro@@ w .
by the end of 2000 there were ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 5@@ 00 000 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s in W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a of w@@ h@@ o@@ m ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 3@@ 6@@ 0 000 were B@@ ur@@ un@@ di@@ ans , 1@@ 1@@ 0 000 C@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ e@@ s@@ e and the re@@ ma@@ in@@ d@@ er R@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ ans , S@@ om@@ al@@ is and other n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ities .
through E@@ C@@ H@@ O the Commission funds more than one third of the to@@ ta@@ l h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid available to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a .
in the year 2000 , E@@ C@@ H@@ O &apos;s b@@ u@@ d@@ get for aid to T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es was EUR 2@@ 6@@ .@@ 8@@ 5 m .
E@@ C@@ H@@ O &apos;s level of support is ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to re@@ main su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally the same this year .
the key par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a are the In@@ ter@@ national F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation of the R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ s@@ s and R@@ ed C@@ res@@ c@@ ent , the U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R , U@@ N@@ I@@ C@@ E@@ F and the W@@ or@@ l@@ d F@@ o@@ o@@ d P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me .
the main objectives of the h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid are m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ sector c@@ are of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , fe@@ ed@@ ing , education , health c@@ are for children and finally , public health , w@@ a@@ ter and s@@ an@@ it@@ ation in the c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s .
as to the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of n@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ ition in@@ si@@ d@@ e the c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s , E@@ C@@ H@@ O con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tes one third of the to@@ ta@@ l c@@ o@@ s@@ t of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d F@@ o@@ o@@ d P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a , which pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed d@@ a@@ il@@ y ra@@ tion of 2@@ 1@@ 6@@ 6 c@@ al@@ or@@ ies per re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e , well over the min@@ im@@ u@@ m re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed by the W@@ H@@ O .
the W@@ F@@ P rec@@ ently al@@ er@@ ted the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity to p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al problems of su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , which would be due to d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in funding from s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es other than the Commission , and d@@ a@@ il@@ y ra@@ tions were te@@ m@@ por@@ ar@@ il@@ y re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed to 8@@ 0 % .
however , the ra@@ tions re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate in view of the fact that many re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es have access to ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es of food .
in 1999 , F@@ A@@ O j@@ o@@ in@@ ed the international re@@ li@@ e@@ f op@@ er@@ ation by in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a programme to improve n@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ ition st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds a@@ m@@ on@@ g the most v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ ds .
in c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation with U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R , F@@ A@@ O pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed 1@@ 5 000 f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies in si@@ x of the c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s with se@@ ed@@ s and hand to@@ ol@@ s in order to pl@@ ant h@@ ou@@ se@@ h@@ ol@@ d and com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ ble g@@ ar@@ d@@ en@@ s .
training was given and F@@ A@@ O e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ tes that more than 5@@ 0 000 people have b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ited di@@ rec@@ tly from the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
I have seen this programme and it is in fact so well @-@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised and so n@@ e@@ at that the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that we can o@@ f@@ f@@ er the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es when they re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n l@@ o@@ o@@ ks much less or@@ g@@ an@@ ised .
but , of course , this is what we are going to support .
concerning the possible re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation of B@@ ur@@ un@@ di@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a following the si@@ g@@ n@@ ing of the peace agreement at the A@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ a S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , the Commission is ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing a state of re@@ ad@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s for this e@@ v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ al@@ ity .
I was m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f present at the B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i d@@ on@@ or@@ s &apos; con@@ f@@ er@@ ence c@@ ha@@ i@@ red by N@@ el@@ s@@ on M@@ an@@ d@@ el@@ a in P@@ ar@@ is in December , which en@@ d@@ or@@ sed the peace agreement .
the Commission is pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing a t@@ w@@ in @-@ tra@@ c@@ k approach .
firstly , the current level of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es will be ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed while they re@@ main in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a .
secondly , should the conditions be m@@ e@@ t for their re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation - and we are pu@@ sh@@ ing e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y concerned and some who do not think they should be concerned to make this ha@@ p@@ p@@ en - then the funds al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated by E@@ C@@ H@@ O to the T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a programme will follow the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es back h@@ om@@ e .
an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al su@@ m of EUR 2@@ 5 million has been al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated by the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G under the L@@ om@@ é C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion &apos;s A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 5@@ 5 to as@@ s@@ is@@ t U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R in a pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed and or@@ d@@ er@@ ly re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation .
at this stage , the pre@@ conditions for an or@@ d@@ er@@ ly and v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation unfortunately are not m@@ e@@ t .
this was dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed in E@@ C@@ H@@ O &apos;s an@@ n@@ u@@ al st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ing meeting with U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R in December when it was agreed that re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation may only take place if all parties are con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that the security situation in@@ si@@ d@@ e B@@ ur@@ un@@ d@@ i is st@@ ab@@ il@@ ised and su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able .
this is a major op@@ er@@ ation of ou@@ r@@ s and we want to follow it through to a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion .
Commissioner , I think it only f@@ a@@ i@@ r to thank you for such an ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ ve an@@ s@@ w@@ er , which to a certain ex@@ t@@ ent re@@ as@@ su@@ res me .
to the same ex@@ t@@ ent as you are re@@ as@@ su@@ red , I think , because there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the problems of these n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ a are se@@ ver@@ e .
we had the W@@ or@@ l@@ d F@@ o@@ o@@ d P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me report , which said that food res@@ er@@ v@@ es would r@@ u@@ n out by the end of the year .
there is also the need to provide for the training and education of all these re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , even though they are in an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous situation in their li@@ v@@ es , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y so that these years should not be w@@ a@@ st@@ ed years .
therefore , not only is it essential to give h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an food aid , but education programmes and health programmes are also n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed so that these tra@@ g@@ i@@ c years for this people will not be w@@ a@@ st@@ ed years but can be the st@@ ar@@ ting point for better ti@@ m@@ es and especially for the per@@ man@@ ent re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation of the B@@ ur@@ un@@ di@@ an people .
question No 4@@ 3 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 8@@ 4 / 00 ) :
subject : conflict P@@ re@@ v@@ en@@ tion and P@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing in the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ o@@ w does the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G in@@ t@@ end to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate with the Swedish Presidency on issues re@@ la@@ ted to conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing in de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries ?
peace b@@ u@@ il@@ ding and conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion , management and resolution continue to have a high priority in our policies , and the Commission w@@ el@@ comes the importance at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to those issues by the Swedish Presidency .
peace and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c st@@ ability are in@@ dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ ble pre@@ conditions for economic and social progress .
conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion is an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l part of the EU &apos;s external policy objectives .
the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge is now to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s in con@@ c@@ re@@ te terms the ro@@ o@@ t c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts and to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on actions and the implementation of policies .
the EU &apos;s contribution to conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion is g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st where we can use or ad@@ ap@@ t our different in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , especially trade and cooperation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , development assistance and social and environmental in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of conflict .
the last D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment Council , by f@@ o@@ c@@ using the objective of development policy on p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion , has la@@ i@@ d the basis for ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing one of the major c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of conflict - the w@@ i@@ d@@ en@@ ing of dis@@ par@@ ities in pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity and p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
let me again re@@ p@@ e@@ at that the H@@ I@@ P@@ C initiative al@@ le@@ v@@ i@@ ating the de@@ b@@ t of the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st countries is also a very real contribution to conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ ally , the l@@ o@@ w level of development assistance is , in my view , the b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ est s@@ in@@ g@@ le issue that needs to be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed if we are to be serious about conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
the Commission has already had n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with the Swedish Presidency and we share their concerns .
it was , for example , dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to have a policy debate on conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion in the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council on 2@@ 2 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
we agreed that we n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion in ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing policy in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then cooperation with the United N@@ ations , the O@@ S@@ C@@ E and other regional organisations and to find common ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es to c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a of d@@ e@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ ation such as the trade in n@@ ar@@ co@@ ti@@ c@@ s , weapons or di@@ a@@ m@@ on@@ ds .
we really need better in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments in these fi@@ el@@ ds , of course .
the Commission will present a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion this s@@ pr@@ ing .
it is fully aware of the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al role of development cooperation in this context .
we will work c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y with the Swedish Presidency to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing at the to@@ p of our agenda .
Mr President , Commissioner , the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is , of course , very sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y but I w@@ on@@ de@@ red if you were aware Commissioner that the st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c policy pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing and e@@ ar@@ ly w@@ ar@@ n@@ ing un@@ its in the Commission has 20 st@@ a@@ f@@ f , 1@@ 1 of w@@ h@@ o@@ m are responsible for the Balkans and only one responsible for A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a which is your responsibility .
I w@@ on@@ d@@ er if you would look at that issue and t@@ r@@ y to ensure that we have more st@@ a@@ f@@ f on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d in these un@@ its .
also , are you aware that they de@@ pen@@ d on an@@ n@@ u@@ al funding which means that they cannot make long @-@ term pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing of the kind that you su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed now , so it is important that the Commission l@@ o@@ o@@ ks at these issues .
secondly , Commissioner , the whole matter of dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ation to the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations : will you be en@@ sur@@ ing that in the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations you have members of st@@ a@@ f@@ f with ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise to deal with conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and peace b@@ u@@ il@@ ding ?
the an@@ s@@ w@@ er is in all h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y &quot; no , &quot; and everyone k@@ no@@ ws that the Commission is not in a position , unfortunately , to give a good an@@ s@@ w@@ er to this kind of question .
we are in the h@@ an@@ ds of Members States and this House in our st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le to get enough st@@ a@@ f@@ f , qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied st@@ a@@ f@@ f , to do what we are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted and su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to do .
but , I am not able to say , &quot; y@@ es &quot; we will do this as Mrs K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k and I would like .
that is not so e@@ as@@ y .
on the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of people g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ ally as to their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in the e@@ ar@@ ly w@@ ar@@ n@@ ing group and the political bo@@ di@@ es we have c@@ re@@ ated to do these things better , I do not think it can be m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red only in that way .
defin@@ it@@ el@@ y with the new st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture the more c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ c@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing , general h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of relations with the A@@ C@@ P countries for in@@ st@@ ance , the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G will be given more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s as the di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of la@@ b@@ our ch@@ an@@ g@@ es between the D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment D@@ G and the new cooperation o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e .
this is part of our own ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment to these priorities , and that is defin@@ it@@ el@@ y the way I will t@@ r@@ y to improve our e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , even on the basis of the given resources .
as the time al@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ted to qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to Mr N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on has el@@ ap@@ sed , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 4@@ 4 to 6@@ 5 will be an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to the Commission .

and on the Commission dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o .
the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a , has the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to ra@@ ise a point of order .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , because y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day we de@@ b@@ ated this subject in committee , and especially also on behalf of all the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s of the reports we are to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s today , and if the Commissioner , with w@@ h@@ o@@ m I have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en , has no ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion , and it se@@ em@@ s he has not , I should like to ask you if we might first he@@ a@@ r the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment from the Commissioner h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f and then we the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s could speak in the order la@@ i@@ d down .
that is what I should like to ask you , Mr President .
Mr President , I am not going to speak about an@@ y@@ th@@ ing that we are going to debate now , and I ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ise for de@@ par@@ ting from the agenda .
this very e@@ v@@ en@@ ing I have le@@ ar@@ n@@ t that t@@ en members of the en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t organisation , G@@ re@@ en@@ peace , t@@ en pa@@ c@@ i@@ f@@ is@@ t en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , have been ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed by the military authorities of the R@@ o@@ c@@ k of G@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ al@@ ta@@ r , because they were t@@ r@@ ying to get n@@ e@@ a@@ r the su@@ b@@ mar@@ ine T@@ i@@ re@@ less with a pla@@ c@@ ar@@ d ex@@ p@@ res@@ sing what I believe everyone th@@ in@@ ks : that the se@@ a should not be o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ ed by n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy .
these en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s are still under ar@@ re@@ st , and since Parliament has been , let us say , rather in@@ s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve about sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding the interests of the citizens of the C@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ o de G@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ al@@ ta@@ r and A@@ l@@ g@@ ec@@ i@@ ra@@ s B@@ a@@ y , I ask at least that appropriate st@@ e@@ p@@ s should be taken so that these pa@@ c@@ i@@ f@@ is@@ t en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s can s@@ le@@ e@@ p in their own h@@ om@@ es .
thank you very much .
Mr B@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ is@@ t@@ a O@@ j@@ ed@@ a , as for s@@ le@@ e@@ p@@ ing in their own h@@ om@@ es , I am not sure if it is fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble that we could achieve that from here at this time , but we take good no@@ te of your in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which will ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r in the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes , since I su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e you would also like that to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
Mr N@@ o@@ gu@@ e@@ ir@@ a R@@ om@@ á@@ n may take the f@@ l@@ o@@ or .
Mr President , it se@@ em@@ s appropriate to me that Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er should come before this Parliament today to deal with the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o question .
I think it is en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly appropriate .
what I think is to@@ t@@ ally in@@ appropriate is to have m@@ er@@ ged a debate on f@@ our res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions that the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies con@@ si@@ d@@ ers h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly important for the future of the common fisheries policy with a debate on the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o question , which will in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly take over from the other de@@ b@@ a@@ tes pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed .
I think these are two en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t de@@ b@@ a@@ tes , which should have taken place at se@@ par@@ ate ti@@ m@@ es during this S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion , and each one should have been given the importance it d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es .
as that has not ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed , we Members above all who have little time will be ob@@ li@@ ged either not to t@@ al@@ k about M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o or not to t@@ al@@ k about the other reports and th@@ us the future of the common fisheries policy , and both op@@ tions are la@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ble .
Mr N@@ o@@ gu@@ e@@ ir@@ a , our working conditions are la@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ble in general .
we are t@@ r@@ ying to improve them so that the de@@ b@@ a@@ tes can be con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted more cor@@ rec@@ tly .
you are aware that there is a working d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment by the B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s this subject .
but on the specific point that you m@@ en@@ tion , a@@ part from taking no@@ te as is my d@@ u@@ ty , I can te@@ l@@ l you that your group voted in favour of this proposal at the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents .
therefore , I understand your ar@@ gu@@ ments , but I would be gra@@ te@@ ful if you would also pa@@ s@@ s them on to the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of your own group .
Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a has the f@@ l@@ o@@ or .
Mr President , I wish to use this point of order to state that I understand the issue raised by Mr N@@ o@@ gu@@ e@@ ir@@ a R@@ om@@ á@@ n , but this is a question of ti@@ m@@ ing , as the President said .
we must understand this .
this is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why I understand and support the issue raised by the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of our Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es ­ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a .
the t@@ r@@ u@@ th of the matter is that the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o situation is an extremely important issue for many of us and it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to speak right at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the debate on this issue .
I would say that , given the political importance of the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can question , st@@ r@@ ic@@ t ad@@ h@@ er@@ ence to pro@@ to@@ co@@ l on the agenda is of se@@ con@@ d@@ ary importance .
I therefore think that it would make s@@ en@@ se to ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge the debate as I have su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed .
thank you , Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a .
I think the best th@@ ing to do is to pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to the debate , and if there is no ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion I shall take up the proposal by the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies .
so , Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , the f@@ l@@ o@@ or is y@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
Mr President , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , I am , of course , per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to start by making the re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on fisheries relations between the Union and M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o .
as you pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly already know from the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a , n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on a new form of c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation in the fisheries sector were st@@ ar@@ ted with the K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o following my v@@ is@@ it to C@@ a@@ sa@@ b@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ a in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er , when the K@@ ing of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o agreed to be@@ g@@ in serious n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations .
as a result , a to@@ ta@@ l of si@@ x r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of technical n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to@@ o@@ k place between 3@@ 0 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and 2@@ 2 December .
I then m@@ e@@ t P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister Y@@ ou@@ s@@ s@@ ou@@ f@@ i and F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies Minister C@@ h@@ b@@ a@@ a@@ to@@ u for t@@ al@@ ks t@@ w@@ ice at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary - once for three d@@ a@@ y@@ s and once for two d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
I to@@ o@@ k great pa@@ in@@ s to ensure that both si@@ d@@ es under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d the main aspects of future fisheries relations , especially with regard to fishing p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , the term of the agreement , technical fishing conditions and , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , financial com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion .
n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations were held n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly every day between the first and second political m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s this year , more rec@@ ently at technical level .
we have done a great deal of con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive work and n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous de@@ ta@@ il@@ s have been c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied .
the Commission has en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red throughout the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to d@@ ate to be as f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble as it fe@@ el@@ s it can be on M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o &apos;s main d@@ em@@ an@@ ds , especially as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the ex@@ t@@ ent of fishing p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y l@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s in M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can por@@ ts .
we have st@@ a@@ ted from the start that we are pre@@ pa@@ red both to take account of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can interests and to support the development of the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can fisheries sector .
we have also made clear time and again that we want to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the Community &apos;s social and economic interests and are l@@ o@@ o@@ king for help in p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ing resources .
unfortunately , the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can si@@ d@@ e su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly to@@ o@@ k a very in@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ g@@ ent st@@ ance during my second v@@ is@@ it on 8 and 9 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , especially on the important qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons of fishing p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and technical terms , and made ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve d@@ em@@ an@@ ds for financial com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion .
I t@@ ri@@ ed to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can si@@ d@@ e to re@@ consider its position , because an agreement was not on the c@@ ar@@ ds on this basis , and I as@@ k@@ ed them to re@@ su@@ me t@@ al@@ ks as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible in a b@@ i@@ d to re@@ ac@@ h a fin@@ al agreement .
we are pre@@ pa@@ red to pa@@ y a f@@ a@@ i@@ r pr@@ ice for a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed agreement , but the pr@@ ice must be in pro@@ por@@ tion to the fishing p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities g@@ r@@ an@@ ted by M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and I have always clearly given the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can si@@ d@@ e to understand as much .
if our M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can par@@ t@@ n@@ ers are now pre@@ pa@@ red to re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating ta@@ ble and s@@ how w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate , then I am sure that , in the end , we shall b@@ ro@@ k@@ er a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion which is acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to both si@@ d@@ es .
finally , I should like to point out that the question of cooperation with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o in the fisheries sector was one of the main points on the agenda for President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i &apos;s v@@ is@@ it to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , when both si@@ d@@ es to@@ o@@ k the opportunity of re@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing their wish to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de an agreement .
it was therefore agreed that we should re@@ su@@ me n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations at a technical level as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible .
thank you , Commissioner .
it is now the t@@ u@@ r@@ n of the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s , and I should like to re@@ mind them that , despite the te@@ m@@ p@@ ta@@ tions , they are ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s and they have to present their reports .
first , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a .
Mr President , thank you very much for your under@@ st@@ an@@ ding .
I wish to thank Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er for his st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on the fisheries agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , and I also wish to thank h@@ i@@ m for all the e@@ f@@ for@@ t he is pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing into these difficult n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations .
we all k@@ new they would be difficult and l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y .
I should like to re@@ mind you here , as he too has said , but I want to st@@ res@@ s this , that it is the first time that a President of the European Commission has been per@@ s@@ on@@ ally involved in n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating a fisheries agreement .
it must be clear both to the citizens of the European Union and to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o that all the institutions in the European Union - and at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est level - want this agreement : the European Council w@@ an@@ ts it , and it said so at Nice ; the President of the Commission , who has been to R@@ ab@@ at , w@@ an@@ ts it ; and the European Parliament in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g w@@ an@@ ts it .
so , for the time being , the one that does not want it , and I say for the time being , is M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , at least on the terms that the European Union is d@@ em@@ an@@ ding .
let us hope that together we can s@@ o@@ on man@@ age to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e them of the m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of this agreement and th@@ us be able to as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ate President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i with this su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
I just ask , Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , that the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations be re@@ su@@ m@@ ed as s@@ o@@ on as possible - im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly if they can be - to make the most of the bo@@ o@@ s@@ t that the President of the European Commission h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f has given them .
as has also been said here , I do not want M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o to draw our attention a@@ way from the extremely important debate that we have here today .
we have been su@@ m@@ m@@ on@@ ed to debate f@@ our major reports to do with the common fisheries policy and its future .
I am going to f@@ o@@ c@@ us , n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , on min@@ e , the one for which I am the rapporteur , but first I should like to congratulate Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and also Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a on the ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ent j@@ o@@ b they have done .
I want to point out in relation to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion has d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up on g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation in fisheries , and therefore I think our Committee has h@@ it the n@@ a@@ i@@ l on the he@@ a@@ d with the two own @-@ initiative reports it has dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce ; the other one is still in progress .
in min@@ e , in this report , what I want to st@@ res@@ s is this : first of all , Commissioner , the fishing industry in the European Union must start to s@@ ha@@ k@@ e o@@ f@@ f this al@@ most d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic or al@@ most mar@@ g@@ in@@ al i@@ ma@@ ge that it currently has , perhaps because of the fact that it is con@@ fin@@ ed to per@@ i@@ p@@ h@@ er@@ al regions or because of the c@@ ol@@ d@@ ness of the Community G@@ D@@ P contribution fi@@ gu@@ res that are always being mentioned .
we have to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al importance that fishing now has .
we are b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing more and more de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on im@@ por@@ ted f@@ ish ; we have our own f@@ le@@ e@@ t on all the se@@ as and we have enough technical k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of our own not to le@@ a@@ ve this st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c sector in the h@@ an@@ ds of third countries .
the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 reform , therefore , must not s@@ er@@ ve just for us to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on st@@ ar@@ ing at our own n@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ l in the form of our own Community w@@ a@@ ters , our own problems and our own mis@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ es .
what we really need is a f@@ le@@ e@@ t of the right si@@ z@@ e that is com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve at European and world levels .
more com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve does not mean more pre@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y but simply more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent at using the resources actually available , and doing this better than everyone el@@ se .
the fishing sector is now st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c - and will be more so in the future - as a food res@@ er@@ ve : he@@ al@@ th@@ y and sa@@ f@@ e an@@ i@@ ma@@ l pro@@ te@@ in@@ s for a g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing human population .
we must in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve fisheries - and this is also s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n by the fisheries agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o - in the European Union &apos; s f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy and com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al policy .
our Union &apos; s f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n fisheries policy has to e@@ ar@@ n c@@ re@@ di@@ bility and an i@@ ma@@ ge , which it does not yet have , st@@ an@@ ding before world public opinion as it really is : the policy of a fishing power as com@@ p@@ li@@ ant as any other with the United N@@ ations pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , that is , the development of the international law of the se@@ a , the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of resources for all , cooperation for development , et@@ c .
let us therefore make it an ac@@ tive policy , both in fisheries ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with third countries , ad@@ ap@@ ted to each in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al situation , and in the regional f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y organisations , in which we must pla@@ y a le@@ ad@@ ing role , as we have often said , and let us not re@@ si@@ g@@ n ourselves to a situation in which the 1@@ 5 st@@ a@@ tes that today make up the European Union - t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w perhaps 20 or 2@@ 5 - must f@@ o@@ re@@ v@@ er have as much w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t as , for in@@ st@@ ance , E@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ a has now .
the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of the European Union or the United N@@ ations S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity Council are ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es to be@@ a@@ r in mind of v@@ o@@ ting systems w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted by the specific w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies and p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions , and we should be@@ a@@ r this important example in mind .
my report st@@ a@@ tes that the European Union has not yet w@@ o@@ k@@ en up to the importance of its f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y concerns at an international level .
ad@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ d@@ ly , as I said e@@ ar@@ li@@ er , its re@@ la@@ tive importance to the Community G@@ D@@ P is small , but we must not for@@ get that ou@@ r@@ s is the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th l@@ ar@@ g@@ est f@@ le@@ e@@ t in the world .
if we to@@ ta@@ l up the pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing and mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting industry , su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ary in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in other countries and s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ ed sh@@ i@@ p@@ b@@ u@@ il@@ ding , EU fisheries @-@ l@@ in@@ k@@ ed economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity is the most su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al in the world .
other p@@ o@@ w@@ ers , like the United States and J@@ ap@@ an , are aware of this and are in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing in this sector .
in the W@@ or@@ l@@ d T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation we must not be a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d to st@@ and up for our interests , and for our st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l aid system too , since not all of it re@@ la@@ tes di@@ rec@@ tly to fishing : some is aid for con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ing and con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ing resources , making v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s sa@@ f@@ er , im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and the s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive ar@@ ts of fishing .
in the W@@ T@@ O we must d@@ em@@ and the real li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of por@@ t services , the freedom to in@@ v@@ est and establish in third countries with full legal gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es and freedom of access to por@@ ts .
let us d@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ ce at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve economic z@@ on@@ es and le@@ a@@ d the effective fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against f@@ la@@ g@@ s of con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ence .
all this , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , is the real ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge f@@ ac@@ ing the common fisheries policy from economic g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
the European Parliament is today o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing this report to which I re@@ f@@ er as food for th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t for everyone on the e@@ ve of an h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic reform of the common fisheries policy , so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to .
Mr President , Commissioner , at the ou@@ t@@ set I want to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the assistance which I received from the se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ ri@@ at of the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies and indeed from the se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ ri@@ at of my own group in pre@@ par@@ ing this report .
I want to thank Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant for his cooperation while pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing my report .
both m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f and Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant had one major pre@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ pa@@ tion - to make sure that our reports were not only com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y , but more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly that they were not con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y .
after all they deal with the same subject , and I would like to think that the same s@@ p@@ ir@@ it will pre@@ va@@ i@@ l in the House when both reports are voted on t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
under the regulation e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a Community system for fisheries and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , the Commission is ob@@ li@@ ged to report at least every three years to Parliament , the Council and the Community bo@@ di@@ es re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing the sector on the implementation of measures and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in the common fisheries policy .
this report re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ ws the years 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
the ti@@ m@@ ing of the present com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation g@@ i@@ v@@ es it a special si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance in that it re@@ p@@ res@@ ents a b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ge to the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er to be pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on the re@@ view of the common fisheries policy .
not only is this is an h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of the past , it is an important in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation of the di@@ rec@@ tion of Commission th@@ in@@ king about the future and s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the C@@ F@@ P after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 .
this , of course , is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed .
the report co@@ ver@@ s all aspects of the C@@ F@@ P , including con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion and management of resources , st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l policy , external fisheries policy , market policy and monitoring and control .
many of these points can be en@@ d@@ or@@ sed by us , indeed as the Commission ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ es , a number of these priorities are those which Parliament itself set and has long d@@ em@@ an@@ ded .
I would like to under@@ line to you , as I have done in my report , a number of points that I feel st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly about .
I re@@ g@@ re@@ t the present un@@ sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y state of f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks in relation to technical con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion measures .
I believe that more progress can still be made .
in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of initiatives taken by the Commission to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then its dialogue with the industry , I believe that these should be fully re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ed .
I believe that f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men must be more involved in the work of s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s in order to establish m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
I have st@@ r@@ on@@ g su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ i@@ ons that m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al programmes have op@@ er@@ ated in a dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion without pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing any major b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its to the fishing sector as a whole .
I would like to see a uni@@ form in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tion re@@ g@@ im@@ e throughout the Community and the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es for in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ em@@ ents .
I want a st@@ r@@ ic@@ t en@@ for@@ c@@ ement of the Community control system with regard to third country v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s op@@ er@@ ating within EU w@@ a@@ ters .
I am st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly in favour of a greater re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the common fisheries policy through the c@@ re@@ ation of a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve s@@ er@@ ies of regional management un@@ its and regional ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es based on the use of I@@ C@@ E@@ S areas and su@@ b @-@ areas to defin@@ e the b@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ary l@@ in@@ es .
in this context , I want to st@@ res@@ s that re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of fisheries policy is not in any way the same as r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation or fisheries policy .
it does , however , to use the Commission &apos;s own words , in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve the participation of st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers , and I qu@@ o@@ t@@ e &quot; in all the three p@@ ha@@ ses of the management process i@@ .@@ e@@ . con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion , decision @-@ taking and implementation of decisions taken . &quot;
I believe that the lack of cohesion in the regional ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the C@@ F@@ P must in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly le@@ a@@ d to a lack of con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the policy and in the Community institutions .
I believe that it is necessary to defin@@ e the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the C@@ F@@ P in a clear and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er , se@@ t@@ t@@ ing out a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent system of re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that this must en@@ ta@@ i@@ l such f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s as c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r l@@ in@@ ks between f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s , the rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of the s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o @-@ economic f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s in areas h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on fisheries , f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication .
as I have done on so many o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons in the past , I re@@ p@@ e@@ at my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ation it is essential to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in access to the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al w@@ a@@ ters of 1@@ 2 m@@ il@@ es as the ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n p@@ res@@ er@@ ve of the co@@ a@@ st@@ al States and to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d this p@@ res@@ er@@ ve to 2@@ 4 m@@ il@@ es , as pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly agreed by this House in F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary 1999 .
on a per@@ s@@ on@@ al no@@ te I would point out that these last two issues are f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l to my own country , I@@ re@@ land .
I believe that the u@@ t@@ most respect must be pa@@ i@@ d to the need for social , economic , regional cohesion , and that the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est priority must be given to the de@@ f@@ ence of the p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions of regions h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on fisheries .
I want to see the Commission re@@ view the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability so as to take better account of the need for economic , social and regional cohesion .
there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind that this must be done without c@@ al@@ l@@ ing into question the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l principle itself .
I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a on his report .
the fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation that we can all agree on this te@@ x@@ t .
I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to say that all the i@@ d@@ e@@ as con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y have been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the report in one form or another .
Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a has ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed to us in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l the importance of the m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al role of the EU fisheries .
this is something that must be taken into account in future W@@ T@@ O n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to ensure that EU pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers are not put at a dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
the Commission must come up with appropriate n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ation proposals .
un@@ like what was done in relation to ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , I would in@@ v@@ ite Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er to con@@ su@@ l@@ t this House on the fisheries proposals .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a has rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised the need to take into account social and economic f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s , such as employment in co@@ a@@ st@@ al areas .
this must be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation in the W@@ T@@ O t@@ al@@ ks and the re@@ view of the common fisheries policy , and I welcome the re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to an environmental and health food st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d in Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a &apos;s report .
I also want to congratulate my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a on his report .
Mr President , the report I am p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing de@@ als with the regional m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s ar@@ r@@ an@@ ged by the Commission in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 @-@ 1999 .
it has been subject to in@@ t@@ en@@ se and , at ti@@ m@@ es , he@@ ated debate in committee , because it is one of the first reports , like those by Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a and Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a , to force us to consider the common fisheries policy for 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 rather than because it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al or l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to le@@ a@@ d to decisions being made .
this is a s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve subject , in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing a sector with very specific ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s and one which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts some quite t@@ y@@ p@@ ical and f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly l@@ im@@ ited regions in Europe .
the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the sector u@@ su@@ ally g@@ en@@ er@@ ate a great many j@@ o@@ b@@ s both up and d@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ re@@ am , making many regions de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on fisheries , with no e@@ as@@ y al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es to t@@ u@@ r@@ n to in ti@@ m@@ es of crisis .
everyone in these regions k@@ no@@ ws that 3@@ 1 December 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 will be c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , since this is the de@@ ad@@ line for the common fisheries policy , as in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 2 and 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 , as if we pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed a new one every 1@@ 0 years .
with a view to for@@ m@@ ing as r@@ ou@@ n@@ ded an opinion as possible in order to pre@@ par@@ e for this de@@ ad@@ line , which I believe was a good idea , the Commission or@@ g@@ an@@ ised a s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion process in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing everyone as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated or involved with this ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , s@@ en@@ ding out qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ n@@ a@@ i@@ res and ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ ing m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s .
th@@ ir@@ ty m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s were held , att@@ en@@ ded by n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly 1 5@@ 00 people .
with regard to the form of pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s , the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of the report was dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed .
some Members would have pre@@ f@@ er@@ red not to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the subject in too much de@@ p@@ th .
we de@@ b@@ ated the matter at great l@@ en@@ g@@ th within the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y committee and , in the end , the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies w@@ ent al@@ on@@ g with the opinion of the rapporteur - as , in my view , there really was no other op@@ tion - with everyone able to ar@@ gu@@ e their own cor@@ n@@ er on the subject , just as u@@ su@@ al .
with regard to the su@@ b@@ st@@ ance , however , national and even regional di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences within the Member States were seen to be more in@@ t@@ en@@ se than the rather tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al political di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences , and that is why a number of amendments were tabled .
these amendments s@@ how that , although the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons were s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es far a@@ part , the political debate al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed groups to be re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ed , le@@ ad@@ ing to an open @-@ min@@ ded te@@ x@@ t which pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d st@@ ar@@ ting point , al@@ on@@ g with the other reports , from which to under@@ take the reform of the common fisheries policy .
l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the amendments and more g@@ en@@ er@@ ally , most of the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons voted on in committee adopt the rapporteur &apos; s point of view , with some ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fication or c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication .
a G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er is due to be is@@ su@@ ed in the com@@ ing m@@ on@@ th@@ s - at the end of M@@ ar@@ ch of this year , I believe - f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed by the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive te@@ x@@ t in the course of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 .
at the moment , two main sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s of th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t are dis@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ i@@ ble .
the first would like to see a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h r@@ e @-@ evaluation of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e system and all the f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations , past and present , of the common fisheries policy .
the second , while a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ing a com@@ p@@ le@@ te r@@ e @-@ ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation of the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations , would like to see the system c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied , a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed so that the fisheries sector can de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p while , of course , p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ing f@@ ish resources .
quite ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , the European fisheries sector has to deal with the problems that most other fishing in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es throughout the world are currently ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing . they do not a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t just our con@@ t@@ in@@ ent or our w@@ a@@ ters .
O@@ ver@@ fishing re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , c@@ at@@ ch si@@ z@@ es and re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e , and is the main th@@ re@@ at as far as the future of resources and the fishing industry pro@@ per are concerned .
in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d com@@ p@@ et@@ ition , as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the market in f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y products , is a further problem .
if the fisheries industry is to become more com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve , it will de@@ pen@@ d on the sector &apos; s ability to ad@@ ap@@ t in order to f@@ ac@@ e up to the con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts im@@ p@@ o@@ sed by both the state of its resources and by com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al d@@ em@@ and .
the common fisheries policy is the European Union &apos; s management to@@ o@@ l for re@@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ating the fisheries industry and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture .
this policy was d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up in order to man@@ age a common res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce and to respect the com@@ m@@ it@@ ments la@@ i@@ d down in the first European T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es .
the report , therefore , ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on the f@@ our aspects of the common fisheries policy , which are con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion and management of resources , st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l policy , market organisation and relations with third countries .
re@@ view of the main areas of the Union &apos; s fisheries policy is called for throughout .
that is the gu@@ i@@ d@@ ing principle .
the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle , the la@@ te@@ st th@@ ing , so to speak , is clearly in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , as is the commitment to de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing a responsible fisheries policy .
I should like to fin@@ ish by ad@@ ding , as Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er said , that we do not wish to see re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation become r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation n@@ or do we wish for further social measures to be in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed into the common fisheries policy .
perhaps Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and I have given the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that we are re@@ p@@ e@@ ating ourselves .
p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es re@@ p@@ e@@ ating on@@ e@@ s@@ el@@ f and con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ ting on@@ e@@ s@@ el@@ f .
we have op@@ ted to re@@ p@@ e@@ at ourselves .
Mr President , Commissioner , I simply wish to ask for your under@@ st@@ an@@ ding so that before I em@@ b@@ ar@@ k on the subject of my report , I may take a min@@ u@@ te to speak about M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o . I should like to w@@ ar@@ m@@ ly congratulate Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er for the commitment he has d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted in the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations to r@@ en@@ e@@ w the fishing agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , but these th@@ an@@ ks should also go to the Commission &apos;s en@@ ti@@ r@@ e D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al for F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies .
from the start of the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations we were f@@ ac@@ ed with in@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ g@@ ence on the part of the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ at@@ or@@ s , who p@@ res@@ en@@ ted ar@@ gu@@ ments such as &quot; the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability of fishing st@@ o@@ c@@ ks &quot; to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce access for the European Union &apos; s fishing f@@ le@@ e@@ t .
however , we know that these were not the real ar@@ gu@@ ments , since they did not apply the same c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a to other third countries with which they con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents n@@ or to p@@ ri@@ va@@ te ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with various op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s , including some from the European Union .
given the importance of the agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o to the European Union &apos; s fishing industry , this issue should have im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly been raised as a matter of great political priority within the European Council itself , in the F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs Council and , of course , in the F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies Council .
my im@@ p@@ res@@ sion is that Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er and his st@@ a@@ f@@ f st@@ o@@ o@@ d p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ ally al@@ one in this st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le , a@@ part from one important but is@@ ol@@ ated s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h by the President of the Commission .
it is in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , given that the European Union is h@@ om@@ e to so many m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ ans and that we have pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed that country with so many trade con@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons to ensure its products access to our market , that they should have re@@ c@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ated our op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s and cooperation so little .
this m@@ e@@ ant that the Community authorities at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est level had major political t@@ r@@ u@@ m@@ p c@@ ar@@ ds to pla@@ y , with the help of those Member States most c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y concerned .
we see now , however , that these c@@ ar@@ ds were not pla@@ y@@ ed .
why was this the case ?
in time we will see why , but in any e@@ v@@ ent , I f@@ er@@ v@@ ently hope that we can ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate a re@@ as@@ on@@ able agreement .
let us now pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to the subject of my report , which is G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a ­ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u .
the pro@@ to@@ co@@ l g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing fishing ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents between the European Union and the R@@ e@@ public of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a ­ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u was si@@ g@@ n@@ ed in J@@ un@@ e 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 and c@@ a@@ me into force in December of that year , re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing v@@ al@@ i@@ d until J@@ un@@ e this year .
following an ar@@ m@@ ed conflict in that country in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , the Commission p@@ res@@ en@@ ted to the Council and Parliament a proposal for a decision re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ing that this agreement be su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded .
Parliament &apos; s G@@ ir@@ ã@@ o P@@ e@@ re@@ ir@@ a report , at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of 1999 , con@@ si@@ de@@ red the Commission &apos; s proposal to be j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied and le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te and d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red a f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble opinion .
Parliament th@@ e@@ re@@ by a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ised the su@@ s@@ pen@@ sion of the agreement for the d@@ u@@ ra@@ tion of h@@ o@@ st@@ il@@ ities , after which the su@@ s@@ pen@@ sion would be li@@ f@@ ted and the Government of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a ­ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u would be given help for a@@ d h@@ o@@ c support actions for the local fishing industry , for infrastructure and for monitoring ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
as a result of certain pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l and legal problems raised by a pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous Commission proposal , the Commission is now ta@@ b@@ ling a new proposal .
the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of this new te@@ x@@ t , as with the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous one , but using a different legal for@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ a , is to g@@ r@@ an@@ t the le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te authorities of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a ­ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u a su@@ m e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent to the un@@ pa@@ i@@ d part of the financial com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion la@@ i@@ d down in the agreement currently in force , which to@@ t@@ al@@ s ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d EUR 6@@ .@@ 5 million and which is in@@ t@@ en@@ ded s@@ ol@@ el@@ y for su@@ p@@ por@@ ting local fishing ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities , for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing monitoring measures and for re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ting fisheries infrastructure d@@ a@@ ma@@ ged in the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ing per@@ i@@ o@@ d .
on the basis of a programme of actions proposed by the Government of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u , the Commission will pa@@ y over 5@@ 0 % of the com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion that has been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for and will pa@@ y the b@@ al@@ ance when the government of that country has su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed report on the progress of the actions it has proposed and the results that have been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
this report is due to be su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the Commission by 3@@ 1 M@@ a@@ y 2001 .
the d@@ ate for pa@@ y@@ ment may , however , have to be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed if major problems are en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ te@@ red in the organisation of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u &apos; s ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion , that is , its government , following this ar@@ m@@ ed conflict .
Parliament &apos; s Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies has therefore ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the d@@ ate of 3@@ 1 M@@ a@@ y 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 as the fin@@ al de@@ ad@@ line for the pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing of pa@@ y@@ ments in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the in@@ it@@ i@@ al proposal of M@@ a@@ y 2001 .
therefore , given that the Commission &apos; s proposal is b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally the same as the one to which we g@@ a@@ ve our as@@ s@@ ent in M@@ ar@@ ch 1999 , given that the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of money st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted is ex@@ ac@@ tly the same and given that the proposal has p@@ rec@@ ise objectives , I , as rapporteur , feel that Parliament should d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er a f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble opinion on this proposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that we have not b@@ it@@ t@@ en o@@ f@@ f more than we can c@@ he@@ w this late in the day because this first fisheries debate of 2001 really is a far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing debate .
it g@@ i@@ v@@ es me special p@@ le@@ a@@ sure , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , to be able to welcome you here today .
for a long time , fisheries de@@ b@@ a@@ tes were held in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g on F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
this year we have done a@@ way with F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s and b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t the debate forward to T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day , and while many Members are still not l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ing to us today , you at least are here and I thank you for that .
the new year is a time of hope and ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion , especially for our f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men .
I need only m@@ en@@ tion the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Commission &apos;s e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly a@@ w@@ a@@ ited G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er .
however , I am for@@ c@@ ed to ad@@ m@@ it that the wor@@ r@@ y l@@ in@@ es on my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members &apos; b@@ ro@@ ws and - as far as I can see from here , on your b@@ ro@@ w , too , Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er - are still as de@@ e@@ p as ever .
one reason must su@@ re@@ ly be the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing and difficult n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the fisheries agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o .
I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that there is still no li@@ g@@ h@@ t at the end of that particular t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l .
the Commission &apos;s c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ous and di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c approach - if I may ex@@ p@@ res@@ s it th@@ us - be it on your part , Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , or on the part of Commission President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , has m@@ e@@ t with little res@@ p@@ on@@ se and h@@ ence no real progress on the other si@@ d@@ e - I am te@@ m@@ p@@ ted to say the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing si@@ d@@ e .
I think that is a c@@ r@@ ying s@@ ha@@ me because I want an agreement although , let there be no mis@@ take , I do not want an agreement at any pr@@ ice .
the financial framework is l@@ im@@ ited and EU pa@@ y@@ ments must be in pro@@ por@@ tion to the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its g@@ r@@ an@@ ted in re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n .
in the fin@@ al an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , the K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o needs to take a re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c and t@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y approach .
o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o &apos;s ob@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ is@@ t st@@ ance h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to may well come back to ha@@ un@@ t it , because fisheries are not the only l@@ in@@ k between M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and the EU .
the EU should not be the b@@ ul@@ l in di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y &apos;s ch@@ in@@ a s@@ h@@ o@@ p , but n@@ or should it m@@ e@@ re@@ ly be an ir@@ r@@ it@@ ating f@@ ly b@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ ing ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
the next r@@ ou@@ n@@ d of financial com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion for S@@ p@@ an@@ ish and P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men is com@@ ing up .
it really is time we st@@ ar@@ ted th@@ in@@ king about and n@@ a@@ m@@ ing al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es , however d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic they may be , because aid cannot and should not be a per@@ man@@ ent s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
we are l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward , at last , to taking a c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r look at the st@@ u@@ d@@ y on the c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the fisheries agreement and d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing the necessary con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons .
Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses this particular point in his report .
we had an in@@ it@@ i@@ al p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion an a@@ w@@ fully long time ago and after that m@@ u@@ m was the wor@@ d .
but we must w@@ at@@ ch out - it could be the c@@ al@@ m before the st@@ or@@ m , because there is every si@@ g@@ n of a st@@ or@@ m b@@ re@@ w@@ ing .
but first I should like to thank P@@ at G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er for his excellent report .
as one of our most ac@@ tive com@@ ra@@ d@@ es @-@ in ar@@ m@@ s in the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , he has yet again done a c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ able j@@ o@@ b .
there really is no longer any need to make a point of st@@ res@@ sing just how important an an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of measures and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments is , especially in view of the reform of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e fisheries policy .
but just what will the Commission &apos;s long @-@ a@@ w@@ a@@ ited G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ?
the objective - on this we are clear - must be to re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ e the need to improve f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks with the social and economic importance of fisheries , in which case it is v@@ it@@ al for interest groups to be more involved and , given the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s now com@@ ing to li@@ g@@ h@@ t in the agricultural sector al@@ one , for example as the result of B@@ S@@ E , it also means fin@@ ding a new , att@@ ra@@ c@@ tive way of mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting f@@ ish as a he@@ al@@ th@@ y , pro@@ te@@ in @-@ r@@ ic@@ h food .
as I am sure you are all aware , a h@@ u@@ ge programme of work a@@ w@@ a@@ its us .
I am l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to a st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ ting and con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al debate in the interest of the future of European fisheries .
in any case , I think we should not s@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ en in our efforts .
Mr President , I thank Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er for having come before this House .
he is here because , at the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , the Group of the Party of European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s as@@ k@@ ed h@@ i@@ m to come . may I re@@ mind you , Commissioner , that in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 1999 , a m@@ on@@ th before the agreement ex@@ p@@ i@@ red , you said here that you &quot; would do e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing in your power to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion &quot; and that you &quot; would get your f@@ e@@ e@@ t w@@ e@@ t &quot; .
f@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ en m@@ on@@ th@@ s la@@ ter it is the Community f@@ le@@ e@@ t that is g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing w@@ e@@ t , but the w@@ a@@ ter is up to its n@@ ec@@ k .
but I am not one to b@@ la@@ me you .
I believe you have done what it was within your power to do , which really was very little .
the problem for me is that there has not been a con@@ c@@ er@@ ted e@@ f@@ for@@ t by the various Commission services , and there has not been enough political p@@ res@@ sure from the Council , and what is wor@@ se , in my opinion , is that there has been no clear th@@ in@@ king , s@@ k@@ il@@ l or h@@ ar@@ d work in par@@ al@@ le@@ l by the government of the country most a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , I believe Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i &apos; s v@@ is@@ it - which I think was very positive - rather than re@@ as@@ sur@@ ing the sector has made it more wor@@ ri@@ ed , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because of the moment in the process when it to@@ o@@ k place .
such are the d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts and va@@ c@@ il@@ la@@ tions that the sector fe@@ el@@ s at the moment .
the sector k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ s on re@@ p@@ e@@ ating that it does not want an agreement at just any pr@@ ice , and it is a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that an agreement will be si@@ g@@ n@@ ed just to sa@@ ve f@@ ac@@ e .
the sector sa@@ y@@ s that what the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ ans are o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing - the technical conditions that they want the Community f@@ le@@ e@@ t to su@@ b@@ m@@ it to - is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble , and there are a number of l@@ im@@ it@@ ations on f@@ re@@ e@@ z@@ er tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers and sh@@ r@@ im@@ p v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s that are un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
I think the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can authorities need a clear m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge from the Union . the Union would like to have f@@ a@@ i@@ r cooperation with its par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , and now we all re@@ al@@ ise that we would have g@@ a@@ in@@ ed a l@@ o@@ t if the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can Government had res@@ p@@ on@@ ded in time to Community ap@@ p@@ e@@ als .
it is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble that for 1@@ 4 m@@ on@@ th@@ s the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can Government re@@ p@@ e@@ ated that it did not want an agreement , and now they are t@@ r@@ ying to b@@ la@@ me you , Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , for the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de one and for the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations having b@@ ro@@ k@@ en down .
the result will be that the next A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ ans - like y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f - or S@@ w@@ ed@@ es who n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate in R@@ ab@@ at will think that what the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ ans want is ex@@ ac@@ tly the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite of what they are th@@ in@@ king or sa@@ ying .
this whole ab@@ sur@@ d process , which has been going on now for 1@@ 4 m@@ on@@ th@@ s , is not having any positive effects for one si@@ m@@ p@@ le reason : because in certain se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s in the Union it is g@@ en@@ er@@ ating a re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion of the European Union itself .
here we s@@ pen@@ d d@@ a@@ y@@ s on end dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the Union &apos; s d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ f@@ ic@@ it and good g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance , and then , when we have a subject on our h@@ an@@ ds that di@@ rec@@ tly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts more than 4 000 f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , we pre@@ t@@ en@@ d not to see what is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous and not to do what any government would do to st@@ and up for such an important part of its pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c .
there are some who say that President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i should have b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed not just fisheries cooperation but the whole M@@ E@@ D@@ A I@@ I programme .
with regard to the P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er reports , which bring forward many points for debate on the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing reform of the C@@ F@@ P , I think that if a number of amendments are ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed we shall be able to achieve two b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions and cor@@ rec@@ t some con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tions .
but a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed agreement - such as the one we should re@@ ac@@ h on the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er - does not mean that it is a com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise between various ex@@ t@@ re@@ me p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons but rather a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent report en@@ d@@ or@@ sing the future of the whole sector and the v@@ i@@ ability of fishing as an economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity throughout the European Union .
the b@@ al@@ ance that we s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s de@@ si@@ r@@ e can only be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed through a fisheries policy based on s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a and ad@@ ap@@ ted to the market , with the su@@ p@@ p@@ res@@ sion of the political dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation that still per@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s .
the reform process must be par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ at@@ or@@ y , in the words of Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I congratulate on his work , per@@ for@@ m@@ ed under difficult conditions .
his report re@@ v@@ e@@ als many of the problems that we are going to have to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s during the process of re@@ for@@ m@@ ing the common fisheries policy .
he has su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ed many s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , for in@@ st@@ ance the s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o @-@ economic as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of fishing , the development of the social aspects of the C@@ F@@ P , and the u@@ p@@ d@@ ating of c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a that defin@@ e regions as f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y @-@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent .
the G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er report is also in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing in that it re@@ f@@ ers to social aspects or re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with third countries as a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l part of the C@@ F@@ P .
we are re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ing clear legal and s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c op@@ in@@ i@@ ons on access re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions .
we believe that the reform of the C@@ F@@ P should not con@@ ta@@ in any dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y el@@ ement whether political or based on n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity .
our amendments support k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing the current 6 / 1@@ 2 m@@ il@@ e z@@ one .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , I should like to congratulate Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a - and also Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a - for the excellent report on the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and the d@@ an@@ g@@ ers that certain aspects of it p@@ o@@ s@@ e for the Community fisheries sector .
the international si@@ d@@ e of the C@@ F@@ P , our ever more necessary participation in m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ la@@ te@@ ra@@ l organisations , is a ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge that still a@@ w@@ a@@ its us .
this question is going to re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n and be de@@ b@@ ated many more ti@@ m@@ es in this House .
I congratulate Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a on his political f@@ o@@ re@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t , which could al@@ most be called p@@ o@@ e@@ ti@@ c .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate all the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s on the excellent work that they have done .
I speak s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy .
in fact the term z@@ on@@ al management better ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses the kind of development that we would like to see im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
this would in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve much f@@ ul@@ l@@ er participation in decision making by all those with a di@@ rec@@ t interest in each of the I@@ C@@ E@@ S di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons , whether en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in fishing , f@@ ish pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing , s@@ c@@ i@@ ence or con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion .
if such a system were already in place we would not be f@@ ac@@ ing the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es we f@@ ac@@ e at present over the Commission &apos;s proposals for a co@@ d rec@@ o@@ very plan for the North S@@ e@@ a .
it is the clear view of those most di@@ rec@@ tly involved that , as in@@ it@@ i@@ ally an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed , the plan would have both a dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s effect on the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es concerned and an ad@@ ver@@ se effect on co@@ d st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , and this view is su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ on@@ is@@ t@@ s .
the S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish M@@ E@@ P@@ s are most gra@@ te@@ ful to the Commissioner for meeting us and for his as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es that these proposals are not yet f@@ ir@@ m on@@ es .
a great deal of work has been done l@@ o@@ c@@ ally , both in S@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ land and ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the North S@@ e@@ a , on con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion measures in general and on co@@ d rec@@ o@@ very in particular .
I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly indeed .
in particular , I would ask it to ab@@ an@@ d@@ on the idea of re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing 1@@ 4@@ 0 m@@ m m@@ e@@ s@@ h si@@ z@@ e and also to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the ex@@ t@@ ent to which the S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish f@@ le@@ e@@ t de@@ pen@@ ds on a m@@ i@@ x@@ ed f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing b@@ l@@ an@@ k@@ e@@ t re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions on some 1@@ 5 000 s@@ qu@@ are m@@ il@@ es of the North S@@ e@@ a , I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that it will op@@ t for se@@ as@@ on@@ al c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ u@@ res in areas where the co@@ d con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion is high .
Mr President , Commissioner , it was in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able that the G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant reports would not only com@@ ment on the past but would f@@ o@@ c@@ us in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l on the C@@ F@@ P re@@ view , and I consider it en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly appropriate that the M@@ E@@ P@@ s should se@@ e@@ k to in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence the re@@ view process in ad@@ v@@ ance of any for@@ ma@@ l con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion with Parliament .
I con@@ t@@ end that the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al objective of the C@@ F@@ P , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , has not been re@@ al@@ is@@ ed and as a result we have had to f@@ ac@@ e d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c year @-@ on @-@ year f@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ations in quotas , as ex@@ em@@ p@@ li@@ fied by the current co@@ d crisis .
in addition , we must r@@ e @-@ ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the process by which , and the level at which , decisions are made .
various amendments tabled with my n@@ a@@ me at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed se@@ e@@ k to establish certain important pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es for the C@@ F@@ P re@@ view , including that re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability should re@@ main since the good reasons for its in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion as a f@@ ou@@ n@@ ding principle re@@ main v@@ al@@ i@@ d .
that in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence with areas like the S@@ h@@ et@@ land B@@ o@@ x , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted areas based on s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c ad@@ v@@ ice should continue in the future .
and a system of z@@ on@@ al management should be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed based on the I@@ C@@ E@@ S areas and with re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion from fishing , s@@ c@@ i@@ ence and con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion interests able to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ fully , not to r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ise the C@@ F@@ P , not to take a@@ way power from the Council or the Commission but to allow each Member State with quotas in a particular z@@ one to as@@ s@@ is@@ t in de@@ v@@ is@@ ing and re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ding con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s which are re@@ le@@ v@@ ant , appropriate to these areas and , therefore , more l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed .
recent e@@ v@@ ents have led to even greater lack of f@@ a@@ it@@ h within S@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ land in the decision @-@ making pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses and in the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of the C@@ F@@ P itself .
how can , for example , the Commission j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing levels of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y and even in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s in w@@ h@@ ite f@@ ish by @-@ c@@ at@@ ch while on the other hand re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing quotas of f@@ ish for human con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion ?
let us use the opportunities ar@@ is@@ ing from the re@@ view of the C@@ F@@ P to achieve a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion which wor@@ ks .
I ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge the Commission and the Council to look s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly at z@@ on@@ al management within a framework of Community @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e objectives , of course , but so that in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed parties can par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate more fully and so that the new C@@ F@@ P , once agreed , can actually achieve its pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the long @-@ term su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability of European fisheries .
Mr President , the excellent work done by Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition , but I s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly believe that their z@@ e@@ al - and they are people with va@@ st ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence and k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the sector - has in some res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts led them to go be@@ y@@ on@@ d the subject of their reports .
the problem is that the amendments em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed this view , and g@@ en@@ er@@ ally in some res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts they have even come to ap@@ pro@@ ve con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y points .
I hope that in t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w &apos; s v@@ o@@ tes these issues may be c@@ al@@ m@@ ly cor@@ rec@@ ted , because my group would like to vote for both these reports .
as for the matter of fisheries and g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation , it must be rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised that the l@@ o@@ w level of Community s@@ el@@ f @-@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency in fisheries products has en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of trade s@@ o@@ on@@ er and more fully than in other se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s . while the nature of fishing itself , the g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of fisheries or other c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es may have their own particular fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res , they also have effects si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r to those of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and can have an especially h@@ ar@@ d social impact , with s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es serious effects on working conditions or the dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ement of f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y @-@ re@@ la@@ ted ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
I think the excellent V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a report points out cor@@ rec@@ tive measures for these n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve effects .
I should also like to congratulate Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a .
finally , on the subject of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o I want to point out two things : first , the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve effects that the lack of agreement is having and will have in dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged areas of the Community both on the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men themselves and on f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ y @-@ re@@ la@@ ted de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
because they are dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged areas , re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities st@@ and very little ch@@ ance of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
the second point is that the att@@ it@@ u@@ de of the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ at@@ or@@ s h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly s@@ qu@@ a@@ re@@ s with that of a state l@@ in@@ k@@ ed with us through an as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation agreement .
in this situation it is to be h@@ op@@ ed that the Commission will be able to make the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can authorities understand that the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation can only be based on re@@ c@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ity , and that , if necessary , it will be able to adopt su@@ it@@ able measures .
what the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a is sa@@ ying is that if there is agreement , it may even be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ en@@ ta@@ l to the interests of the European Union .
I should like there to be an agreement , and I hope the Commission will be able to as@@ s@@ er@@ t its right to re@@ c@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ity .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to draw your attention to a point that I believe con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes an om@@ is@@ sion in the common fisheries policy .
it is important that this should be con@@ si@@ de@@ red in the reform to be in@@ it@@ i@@ ated in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 , since it concerns the situation of fishing in the ou@@ ter@@ most regions .
it is also important that the common fisheries policy should take account of the amendment made in the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am and h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al that f@@ l@@ o@@ ws from their situation . this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es particularly to P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al , with its ou@@ ter@@ most regions , the A@@ z@@ o@@ re@@ s and M@@ a@@ de@@ ir@@ a , but also to the French and S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ou@@ ter@@ most regions .
the European Union has an opportunity to draw up an ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve economic z@@ one in these particularly less @-@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red regions , and this st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c v@@ al@@ u@@ e in this field must be em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed for the future .
with regard to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , we are gra@@ te@@ ful for the information that the Commissioner has just given us , although for the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e this is sc@@ ant con@@ s@@ ol@@ ation .
the situation in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al is that 4@@ 0 bo@@ at@@ s have re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed in@@ ac@@ tive since December 1999 and if the agreement is con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded one day , many of these b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses may by then have become un@@ v@@ i@@ able .
I therefore support the re@@ mar@@ ks made by A@@ r@@ l@@ in@@ do C@@ un@@ h@@ a and R@@ o@@ s@@ a M@@ i@@ gu@@ é@@ le@@ z R@@ a@@ m@@ o@@ s to the effect that both the Council and the Commission must at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to adopt a more d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c approach in their dialogue with the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can Government .
in general terms , we have ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed an att@@ it@@ u@@ de of pr@@ u@@ d@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m towards the re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the common fisheries policy in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 .
it is w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y k@@ no@@ w@@ n that the view from P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly c@@ r@@ it@@ ical , because w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as fishing should be a s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of employment , the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence is that the common fisheries policy has been a s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of un@@ employment .
we hope that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the quotas , which was dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed on this year , is a first positive si@@ g@@ n for the future .
we are particularly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the fact that attention has been pa@@ i@@ d to the fe@@ el@@ ing of dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation that has em@@ er@@ ged from con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tions held in recent years , and the fact that the problem of pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing and development has been given due con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , as Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er has p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , we would like to see an ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion z@@ one of 2@@ 4 m@@ il@@ es for co@@ a@@ st@@ al fishing .
Mr President , I still have my d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts as to the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s used , especially in Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant &apos; s report , and I still believe that the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons of the fisheries sector ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed at the regional m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve a more th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation .
in addition , Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant have p@@ res@@ en@@ ted v@@ i@@ e@@ ws in many cases con@@ t@@ r@@ ary to the measures that the C@@ F@@ P should con@@ ta@@ in .
we cannot f@@ a@@ i@@ l to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the e@@ f@@ for@@ t that has been made a p@@ o@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ or@@ i to t@@ r@@ y to uni@@ fy v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ points , but the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that in some f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l areas there are still some clear con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tions .
we have therefore tabled a s@@ er@@ ies of amendments above all to t@@ r@@ y to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that Parliament does not have a defin@@ ite att@@ it@@ u@@ de towards the future of the C@@ F@@ P , because that is not the case .
it may be that we do not agree on specific measures , but if something comes out of these reports it is that Parliament is in to@@ ta@@ l agreement with the fisheries sector in that the C@@ F@@ P re@@ qu@@ i@@ res some f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l ch@@ an@@ g@@ es .
I therefore ask for our amendments to be ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed , because far from en@@ ter@@ ing yet again into st@@ er@@ il@@ e dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons they re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t this de@@ si@@ r@@ e for change and the need for c@@ a@@ re@@ ful th@@ in@@ king about the fisheries policy , with our si@@ g@@ h@@ ts set on the future and not the past .
if there were no clear need for this , the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters last m@@ on@@ th would have given some in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation that this were the case .
things cannot go on like this .
the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l f@@ la@@ ws that have en@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ be@@ red the C@@ F@@ P since the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing have to be pa@@ i@@ d for by the industry at the end of every year with a s@@ er@@ ies of in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly b@@ r@@ u@@ ta@@ l c@@ u@@ ts to its op@@ er@@ ations .
when you come to the ex@@ t@@ re@@ m@@ es that have been re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed this year , you have to w@@ on@@ d@@ er what economic sector could sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve with these rules of pla@@ y .
if res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce levels are g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing wor@@ se and wor@@ se , it is because a se@@ qu@@ ence of f@@ a@@ il@@ u@@ res in the policy that g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ s fishing not only al@@ l@@ o@@ ws it to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en but actually c@@ a@@ u@@ ses it .
a sector con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ed by a s@@ er@@ ies of ou@@ t@@ d@@ ated , con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y and often in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble rules can only have very l@@ im@@ ited responsibility in this state of things , and yet it al@@ one has to pa@@ y the pr@@ ice .
the C@@ F@@ P is in need of very far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing ch@@ an@@ g@@ es that will provide s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions for a fishing industry which , un@@ like the rules which g@@ o@@ ver@@ n it and even despite them , has man@@ ag@@ ed to sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve and has done e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing it can to e@@ v@@ ol@@ ve and continue to provide co@@ a@@ st@@ al regions with w@@ e@@ al@@ th and j@@ o@@ b@@ s .
if the Commission really b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that the future of European fisheries de@@ pen@@ ds not on the si@@ m@@ p@@ le mo@@ di@@ fication of a regulation , but on the proposal of measures already con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in current re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , if the Commission &apos; s great proposal and great dis@@ co@@ very for the future C@@ F@@ P is to be m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al T@@ A@@ C@@ s and the en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement of a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , perhaps the moment has come , Mr President , to ask in all s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness for it to make ro@@ o@@ m for other people who can bring in new i@@ d@@ e@@ as and the t@@ in@@ i@@ est s@@ en@@ se of responsibility .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly and con@@ c@@ is@@ el@@ y , to make three ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions on the pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the common fisheries policy .
my first point concerns access to w@@ a@@ ters and to internal resources .
ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of every fishing com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity should be one of the European Union &apos; s main concerns .
I therefore feel that it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to at least p@@ res@@ er@@ ve ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve access to so @-@ called &quot; ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al w@@ a@@ ters &quot; , particularly given that ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing small @-@ sc@@ al@@ e fishing have a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able effect on the co@@ a@@ st@@ al resources of every Member State .
my second point re@@ la@@ tes to the principle of re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability and the full use of fishing rights ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e Community w@@ a@@ ters .
the principle of re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability is a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l p@@ il@@ la@@ r of the common fisheries policy .
however , the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of this principle to fishing quotas ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed by the European Union through financial com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion , either in ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with third countries or in w@@ a@@ ters g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ed by regional fishing organisations , may le@@ a@@ d to per@@ ver@@ se s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
for example , the Community is not taking full ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the quotas that it ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with such di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in the w@@ a@@ ters of some third countries , even though there are Member States k@@ e@@ en to use them .
therefore , although the so @-@ called ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents &quot; with s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n countries &quot; la@@ y down that once Member States have made use of their res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive fishing rights , the un@@ used part should be made available to all in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed Member States , this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m is not im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted under the so @-@ called ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents &quot; with n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n countries &quot; .
the European Union is not making full use of the fishing quotas for the open se@@ a that it has ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed through regional fishing organisations , even though there are Member States that are k@@ e@@ en to take over the qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities that are not c@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t by the &quot; h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est b@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ ers &quot; , as they are called .
they are th@@ us ex@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing themselves to the r@@ is@@ k that their share will be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed once a re@@ view of quotas al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to the parties involved ta@@ k@@ es place .
my third point re@@ la@@ tes to the role of the European Union on the international stage .
since the Union as a whole is a world @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s fishing power and one of the l@@ ar@@ g@@ est mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts for f@@ ish pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , it must c@@ la@@ i@@ m and adopt a role that ma@@ t@@ ch@@ es its importance in international organisations and s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in regional fishing organisations .
I am very gra@@ te@@ ful for the Commissioner &apos; s s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h and I ur@@ ge h@@ i@@ m to use the power of all 1@@ 5 Member States in n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and not simply to ar@@ gu@@ e the case for P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and S@@ pa@@ in .
Mr President , the common fisheries policy , as many have p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , has f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to con@@ s@@ er@@ ve f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks at a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate levels to support a v@@ i@@ able industry .
this is due , at least in part , to the con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ting nature of some of the objectives of the C@@ F@@ P as la@@ i@@ d down in R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 3@@ 7@@ 6@@ 0 / 9@@ 2 .
it is im@@ possible to si@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ou@@ s@@ ly sa@@ t@@ is@@ fy both the market and industry while con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ing resources .
when the C@@ F@@ P is re@@ v@@ is@@ ed next year it is essential that the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and the protection of the mar@@ ine ha@@ b@@ it@@ at be made its pr@@ im@@ ary and over@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ing objective , and the only way to do this is to implement a ri@@ g@@ or@@ ous and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary approach to fisheries management .
the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary approach should mean that before any st@@ o@@ c@@ k can be f@@ is@@ h@@ ed on a com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al basis there must be , at the very least , a s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the st@@ o@@ c@@ k and a con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y @-@ based to@@ ta@@ l al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ able c@@ at@@ ch .
in other words , the current p@@ il@@ la@@ ge of certain t@@ y@@ p@@ es , certain de@@ e@@ p @-@ w@@ a@@ ter st@@ o@@ c@@ ks by some EU countries would not be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
it means that any new fishing g@@ e@@ a@@ r or any si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant mo@@ di@@ fication of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing g@@ e@@ a@@ r must be e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ated for its p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al impact on the ta@@ r@@ get st@@ o@@ c@@ k as well as any s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies c@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t as by @-@ c@@ at@@ ch or any impact on the mar@@ ine ha@@ b@@ it@@ at .
it means being con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive when one dec@@ i@@ d@@ es the level at which one w@@ an@@ ts to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in a f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ k .
the use of ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able y@@ i@@ el@@ d or any of a number of other re@@ f@@ er@@ ence points is quite simply w@@ r@@ on@@ g , for they le@@ a@@ d to over @-@ fishing and st@@ o@@ c@@ k c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se .
ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s and l@@ im@@ ited re@@ f@@ er@@ ence points must be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed which will ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ k at a high enough level that the r@@ is@@ k of st@@ o@@ c@@ k de@@ p@@ le@@ tion or c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se is in@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant .
the best defin@@ ition to d@@ ate of the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary approach is the one con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in the UN f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks agreement , and many of these and other pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es are defin@@ ed there .
the EU has acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted these i@@ d@@ e@@ as for some st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and I think it is high time that it im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted them for its own st@@ o@@ c@@ ks .
a number of things have been said already about M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and I just want to say that we would in@@ s@@ is@@ t that it is en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly up to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , as a co@@ a@@ st@@ al state with s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty over its f@@ ish and its ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve economic z@@ one , to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e what it w@@ is@@ h@@ es to do with these resources .
we are therefore op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to any kind of political or economic p@@ res@@ sure being b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be@@ a@@ r on M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o in order to encourage it or to co@@ er@@ ce it to si@@ g@@ n an agreement with the European Union .
secondly , we are ad@@ a@@ m@@ ant that no p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o should in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve any access to w@@ a@@ ters of W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ a .
we do not rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty there and so M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o has no right w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s access to EU v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s there , n@@ or for that matter has the EU any right to en@@ ter into such n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o or to allow EU f@@ la@@ g v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s to go there as has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed in the past .
Mr President , 2001 is the year in which the Commission is to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t a new common fisheries policy .
in my view , it is of u@@ t@@ most importance that the Commission should ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve the fisheries industry itself in the pre@@ par@@ at@@ or@@ y ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities le@@ ad@@ ing up to its decisions .
when trans@@ la@@ ting re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch results into c@@ at@@ ch re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions , the Commission should not only take the ad@@ v@@ ice of s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s , but also the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men . if not , im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing to@@ ta@@ l al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed c@@ at@@ ch@@ es and quotas will m@@ e@@ e@@ t with un@@ necessary res@@ is@@ t@@ ance from them .
f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , especially in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of c@@ at@@ ch re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed there is a good reason for them .
a b@@ a@@ d example is the recent c@@ at@@ ch re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion im@@ p@@ o@@ sed on D@@ u@@ t@@ ch f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men for pla@@ ice and s@@ ol@@ e , which will set them back EUR 3@@ 5 million .
this is a re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion which , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the European F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies Council , is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in order to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t co@@ d , w@@ h@@ il@@ st b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ s c@@ la@@ i@@ m that such re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations were n@@ e@@ v@@ er made and that this was a political decision .
European f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men are ac@@ tive in very different w@@ a@@ ters .
this re@@ qu@@ i@@ res a regional approach which is en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly in com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with the European Union &apos; s principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity .
that means that in the case of the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , it will de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the policy for the North S@@ e@@ a in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with other North S@@ e@@ a countries .
these countries will dec@@ i@@ d@@ e whether the f@@ ra@@ g@@ il@@ e system of the North S@@ e@@ a can ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ate sh@@ i@@ p@@ s from other regions .
if the Union in@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s on other sh@@ i@@ p@@ s having access to the North S@@ e@@ a , the qu@@ o@@ t@@ ing of as yet un@@ qu@@ o@@ ted f@@ ish s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies would be a real way of k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al c@@ at@@ ch@@ es of qu@@ o@@ ted f@@ ish within l@@ im@@ its .
finally , I would ec@@ h@@ o rapporteur G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er in his request for a c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of fisheries ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents which the Commission con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es with third countries .
do all Member States b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ a@@ te@@ ly from s@@ pen@@ ding Community funding in this way ?
I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t it very much .
Mr President , when we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the excellent reports by my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a , Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er , it is against a b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d of crisis in the EU fisheries sector .
as we con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late the ra@@ d@@ ical re@@ for@@ m@@ s of the C@@ F@@ P , which are clearly necessary and long over@@ due and which are h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted in these reports , we do so in the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks are in s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ l dec@@ line .
too many f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men are c@@ ha@@ sing too few f@@ ish .
as a result , EU fishing f@@ le@@ et@@ s are sh@@ r@@ in@@ king and many th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of j@@ o@@ b@@ s are being l@@ o@@ s@@ t at se@@ a and on sh@@ or@@ e .
the situation in the North S@@ e@@ a is of particular concern .
S@@ a@@ va@@ ge c@@ u@@ ts in the to@@ ta@@ l al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ able c@@ at@@ ch@@ es and quotas were an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed in December by the Council .
now the Commission is se@@ e@@ king to implement em@@ er@@ g@@ ency in@@ te@@ ri@@ m measures to aid the rec@@ o@@ very of co@@ d st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , which have f@@ al@@ l@@ en to un@@ su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able levels in that sector .
I am extremely gra@@ te@@ ful , like my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , the other S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish M@@ E@@ P@@ s , to Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er for ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing to m@@ e@@ e@@ t us e@@ ar@@ li@@ er this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s these d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c em@@ er@@ g@@ ency measures .
we welcome Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er &apos;s g@@ en@@ er@@ ous o@@ f@@ f@@ er to m@@ e@@ e@@ t with le@@ ad@@ ers of the industry to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es to the d@@ ra@@ con@@ i@@ an proposals which have been w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ised by the F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies D@@ G in the last few d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
a s@@ en@@ si@@ ble , m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al co@@ d rec@@ o@@ very plan em@@ b@@ ra@@ c@@ ing re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c technical con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion measures , the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e of co@@ d s@@ pa@@ w@@ n@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds and the dec@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ing of the l@@ ar@@ g@@ er new fishing v@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s will su@@ re@@ ly be more s@@ en@@ si@@ ble than the pu@@ r@@ su@@ it of a plan which would allow in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al fishing to continue in va@@ st re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted z@@ on@@ es and which would p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ ally le@@ a@@ d to the b@@ an@@ k@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ c@@ y of h@@ al@@ f the S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish f@@ le@@ e@@ t .
the P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er reports have att@@ ra@@ c@@ ted some amendments , which se@@ e@@ k to do a@@ way with the 6 / 1@@ 2 m@@ il@@ e l@@ im@@ its and b@@ re@@ a@@ k open the S@@ h@@ et@@ land B@@ o@@ x and g@@ a@@ in free access to the North S@@ e@@ a .
clearly there are some Member States that still regard the resources of the North S@@ e@@ a as a r@@ ic@@ h p@@ ri@@ z@@ e .
I hope that this debate may bring them to their s@@ en@@ ses .
Mr President , how should and how will the European Union &apos;s common fisheries policy look after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 ?
this question has st@@ ir@@ red the em@@ o@@ tions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now .
the P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant and G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er reports are important m@@ il@@ e@@ st@@ on@@ es in the pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary debate .
the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al debate on reform will , however , not start until the Commission &apos;s G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er has been su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted within the next few m@@ on@@ th@@ s although , quite under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ ab@@ ly , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly dis@@ par@@ ate fisheries interests in the European Union are already t@@ r@@ ying to in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence the pre@@ par@@ at@@ or@@ y process within the Commission .
a great many d@@ em@@ an@@ ds have been made on the Commission .
I think it is still too e@@ ar@@ ly for the European Parliament to com@@ m@@ it itself one way or another .
we should con@@ fin@@ e ourselves , within the framework of these two reports , to ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the problems and dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing various possible s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions .
both ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s have done a great deal of work and have h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted the b@@ a@@ si@@ c problems of the common fisheries policy and I am gra@@ te@@ ful to them for that .
I should like to s@@ in@@ g@@ le out just three of these b@@ a@@ si@@ c problems .
first , the problem of access to w@@ a@@ ters , which should at least be r@@ e @-@ ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed as part of the reform .
protection z@@ on@@ es must be defin@@ ed on the basis of s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c st@@ u@@ di@@ es and the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons must be d@@ ra@@ w@@ n from their results .
secondly : re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation is another c@@ at@@ ch@@ wor@@ d which re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly g@@ i@@ v@@ es r@@ ise to con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al debate .
but re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation does not mean some form of r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
we have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to st@@ a@@ y .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly : I should like to fin@@ ish by again h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting how important it is for the whole fisheries sector - f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , s@@ c@@ i@@ ence , industry and so on - to be involved in the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing reform process .
this is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted by those w@@ h@@ o@@ m it a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts .
Mr President , European Union fisheries policy is a va@@ st subject .
I would like to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le it from the point of view of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and in relation to the specific problem of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u .
as far as the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s is concerned , I would re@@ mind you that we are in favour of a fisheries policy that res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts the natural b@@ al@@ ance , in favour of de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing o@@ f@@ f@@ sh@@ or@@ e and in@@ sh@@ or@@ e fishing , which c@@ re@@ a@@ tes j@@ o@@ b@@ s , and in favour of s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive fishing , which ta@@ k@@ es account of available st@@ o@@ c@@ ks .
this is a question of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th to sa@@ t@@ is@@ fy b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses as well as pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting social aspects .
we are against g@@ r@@ an@@ ting su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es that encourage ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al fishing , which c@@ at@@ ch@@ es e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ a@@ te@@ ly , to the point of w@@ i@@ p@@ ing out s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies and h@@ ar@@ m@@ ing food safety and b@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , a fisheries policy which al@@ l@@ o@@ ws f@@ le@@ et@@ s to g@@ ro@@ w out of all pro@@ por@@ tion , and so for@@ th .
because of this , we consider that un@@ tra@@ m@@ m@@ el@@ l@@ ed market for@@ c@@ es re@@ p@@ res@@ ent one of the f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s le@@ ad@@ ing to such over @-@ in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment and that these issues should be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation in the next r@@ ou@@ n@@ d of W@@ T@@ O trade n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
we therefore request that the Commission present appropriate proposals , both on the issue of the future di@@ rec@@ tion of the su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s and on social aspects to the other members of the W@@ T@@ O .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we are , g@@ en@@ er@@ ally , not particularly in favour of the b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l fishing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents between the European Union and third countries , often small countries , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e en@@ ti@@ r@@ e b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s are o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on@@ ally no l@@ ar@@ g@@ er than the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es g@@ r@@ an@@ ted them .
it is essential that we re@@ main as in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted as possible .
however , we accept that a res@@ er@@ ve of EUR 6@@ .@@ 5 million was al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u , given that it is as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to an action programme which will support the local fishing industry , infrastructure and con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s and that a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed report on how these funds are being used will be su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to start by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a on his far @-@ si@@ g@@ h@@ ted report , which was acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted by the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e committee , and Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a , who has also done an excellent j@@ o@@ b .
however , it cannot be d@@ en@@ i@@ ed that , as has already been mentioned , the points and issues we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing today are the same as those de@@ al@@ t with by the G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant reports .
I will not go back over the technical reasons why these issues are s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve : the 6 / 1@@ 2 m@@ il@@ e l@@ im@@ its , pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted areas , ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the principle of re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability , re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation which can s@@ om@@ e@@ how be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted as r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
I , too , see the nature of these issues as very specific and share the view st@@ res@@ sed by my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members that they are s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve .
with regard to this , I re@@ p@@ e@@ at that , for the very reason that we are going through a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of reform - and if we are c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying out re@@ for@@ m@@ s then it is because our current strategy is not working or the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of reform would not ar@@ ise - we must be very aware that we cannot le@@ a@@ ve e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing as it is , n@@ or , mo@@ re@@ over , can we continue to be in@@ con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent in our re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations .
in this regard , the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party has tabled amendments a@@ im@@ ed p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y at ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing greater co@@ h@@ er@@ ence between the p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
I would , however , make one ent@@ re@@ at@@ y to the Commissioner and to all of us : it is important that a b@@ al@@ ance is f@@ ou@@ n@@ d , for a major political reason a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se .
at the last part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion in December , we all - Commission and Parliament - c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised Nice because the countries &apos; de@@ si@@ r@@ e to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t their own national interests to@@ o@@ k ro@@ o@@ t once again and we con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed that Council for pla@@ c@@ ing the Community m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d in crisis .
now we must work to ensure that a common policy is g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in this t@@ y@@ p@@ ical sector , but in order to do so we must res@@ p@@ on@@ d to those who are com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing - n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s - that there is in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent participation or b@@ ac@@ king for the c@@ h@@ o@@ ic@@ es made , therefore that there is no cooperation in the decision @-@ making process .
if we do this , we will be able to pro@@ ve - and I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that we are c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of doing so - that it is possible to achieve a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d common policy , v@@ al@@ u@@ ing di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences rather than pen@@ al@@ is@@ ing them and in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s of all the Member States , particularly the fisheries op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s in all their di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
Mr President , it is always com@@ for@@ ting to see the same few f@@ ac@@ es at every fishing debate and I would like to re@@ as@@ sure the Commissioner and c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es and f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds that we may be small in n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers but we all have an ac@@ tive interest in fishing and no matter how late the debate is , re@@ st as@@ su@@ red we will be there .
the reform of the C@@ F@@ P and the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing la@@ un@@ ch of the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er mar@@ k a c@@ r@@ it@@ ical time for the fishing industry .
on the one hand all of us here in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er want to see the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence of the fishing industry , not least because we en@@ j@@ o@@ y e@@ ating the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t ; but on the other hand we are f@@ ac@@ ed with gra@@ ve s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of de@@ p@@ le@@ ting f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , so much so that certain s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies may no longer ex@@ is@@ t in the future .
in S@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ land , as mentioned this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing by many of my S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , the issue of co@@ d is d@@ om@@ in@@ ating the n@@ e@@ ws agenda .
some say that even before the la@@ un@@ ch of the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er there could be little le@@ f@@ t of the S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish f@@ le@@ e@@ t because of c@@ u@@ ts in T@@ A@@ C@@ s , quotas and the proposed co@@ d rec@@ o@@ very proposals .
others say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to con@@ s@@ er@@ ve , they h@@ ar@@ k back to the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le in N@@ a@@ ture w@@ ar@@ n@@ ing of the c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se of co@@ d st@@ o@@ c@@ ks .
I really do not know how you s@@ qu@@ are the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ le , but by the end of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 we must .
from t@@ al@@ king to people in the industry , those involved in s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and those involved in con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion , it se@@ em@@ s there is a w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to be involved and a need for greater participation of all those concerned .
in S@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ land , the S@@ co@@ t@@ t@@ ish F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men &apos;s F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation and the W@@ W@@ F have j@@ o@@ in@@ ed for@@ c@@ es and su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed a better way of working .
the proposal for z@@ on@@ al management and greater re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the C@@ F@@ P is a serious one that has the support of fishing and con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion groups al@@ i@@ k@@ e .
in other countries there are also su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
this can only be good for debate .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , this year and next will provide an opportunity to get the C@@ F@@ P right .
I look forward to de@@ b@@ ating this on future T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
Mr President , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i was dec@@ or@@ ated by the K@@ ing of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and at the same time si@@ g@@ n@@ ed a cooperation agreement with that country , which ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded fishing .
the European f@@ le@@ e@@ t in the C@@ an@@ ary @-@ S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ an B@@ an@@ ks has not taken to se@@ a for a year now and th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of workers are g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ded .
the Commission is not f@@ ac@@ ing up to its res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and is w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to si@@ g@@ n a l@@ im@@ ited and il@@ l @-@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ged agreement that can only le@@ a@@ d to the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of our f@@ le@@ e@@ t in two or three years &apos; time .
res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions adopted in this Parliament are sc@@ or@@ n@@ ed , as is Parliament itself , and the Member States , S@@ pa@@ in in particular , t@@ u@@ r@@ n a b@@ l@@ in@@ d e@@ y@@ e .
this is the de@@ pl@@ or@@ able i@@ ma@@ ge that sh@@ i@@ p@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ers , f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men and the p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted in G@@ al@@ ic@@ i@@ a , A@@ n@@ d@@ al@@ u@@ si@@ a , the C@@ an@@ ar@@ ies and P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al have today of the European Union .
I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to have to say this , Commissioner F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , but things could not have been h@@ an@@ d@@ led more b@@ ad@@ ly .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate both M@@ E@@ P@@ s , Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant , on the way in which they have set the t@@ one for the new G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er , for it fe@@ el@@ s like this debate for@@ m@@ s part of the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ work for this pa@@ per , and we could say that we are using these reports for our own en@@ ds in an appropriate m@@ an@@ n@@ er in order to adopt a position on this .
if we consider the fisheries policy , then there is actually one as@@ p@@ ec@@ t which needs to change on a number of levels , and with regard to that debate I should like to put forward a few in@@ it@@ i@@ al points , which are also based on the situation in my region , so as to give you an in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation of the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions we have from the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er .
to be@@ g@@ in with , there is the issue of control , especially qu@@ o@@ t@@ a control , within the EU .
this will need to be re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in future , for any policy h@@ in@@ g@@ es on control , and if we want to adopt a policy in a t@@ r@@ u@@ ly st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red m@@ an@@ n@@ er , s@@ ou@@ n@@ d control is v@@ it@@ al .
this is also the key point , and in due course , we will need to consider s@@ an@@ c@@ tions in this field in the e@@ v@@ ent that countries do not have a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate systems for qu@@ o@@ t@@ a control .
the second important point for the future policy is a re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing programme which needs to be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed to re@@ place the present m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion programme .
European su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es should b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it ac@@ t@@ u@@ al c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most , as well as environmental and quality in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments with the following action points : a se@@ a @-@ day s@@ ch@@ em@@ e in all EU countries - in my own country this s@@ ch@@ em@@ e has wor@@ k@@ ed ex@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ently , which was also e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent from the fisheries con@@ f@@ er@@ ence held in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago .
a second point is a pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m s@@ ch@@ em@@ e for the use of n@@ et@@ s , which re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ts ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al c@@ at@@ ch@@ es .
this is a t@@ r@@ u@@ ly te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement .
the third point is the so @-@ called set a@@ si@@ de s@@ ch@@ em@@ e for regions which are h@@ it h@@ ar@@ d by the d@@ w@@ in@@ d@@ ling f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks .
I am , for example , th@@ in@@ king of regions in Europe which he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y de@@ pen@@ d on co@@ d st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and the dec@@ line th@@ e@@ re@@ of .
Europe should defin@@ it@@ el@@ y in@@ v@@ est in this .
a f@@ ou@@ r@@ th point , in my opinion , is the re@@ organisation of the fisheries policy which must be further de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed .
a fi@@ f@@ th point is the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in food safety , because the di@@ o@@ x@@ in issue will s@@ o@@ on be h@@ it@@ t@@ ing the fisheries industry , and we must be able to deal with this a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
a si@@ x@@ th point is that , in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the environmental problems in c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries upon EU enlargement , we will need to pa@@ y particular attention to the problems which o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r there in the field of food safety .
Mr President , we are f@@ ac@@ ed with the to@@ ta@@ l in@@ ability of the Commission and the Council to n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate on behalf of the citizens .
the la@@ te@@ st E@@ ur@@ o @-@ b@@ ar@@ om@@ e@@ ter d@@ at@@ a s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ is@@ m is r@@ is@@ ing , perhaps as a t@@ r@@ u@@ e re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion of this in@@ ability to n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate .
in the agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o they have had no w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever .
even the French Presidency t@@ ol@@ d us at the time that it was un@@ able to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e an agreement .
we are going to have a major social problem on our h@@ an@@ ds , and we have no real al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve .
now some of our fishing to@@ w@@ n@@ s are going to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p their ec@@ on@@ om@@ y par@@ tly ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d and th@@ an@@ ks to the d@@ r@@ u@@ g that M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o g@@ ro@@ ws and mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts and we E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans con@@ su@@ me .
to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can b@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ ma@@ i@@ l of n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating with the resources of some fishing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds that b@@ el@@ on@@ g to the S@@ a@@ h@@ ra@@ w@@ i people , the Commission res@@ p@@ on@@ ds by se@@ e@@ ing Community f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men as real en@@ em@@ ies , c@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing their quotas and si@@ g@@ n@@ al@@ l@@ ing to M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o that that is the way to go , without pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve .
can an@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y be sure today that all the Community bo@@ at@@ s that have had an@@ y@@ th@@ ing to do with fishing in M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o are ti@@ ed up ?
well , then , M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o @-@ European Union relations must be s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
all the funds p@@ ou@@ red into this agreement should be used to fin@@ ance al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es in the areas a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , the Commission Presidency is t@@ r@@ ying to se@@ t@@ t@@ le a very long @-@ st@@ an@@ ding problem at the last min@@ u@@ te .
we are concerned that the s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion proposed is just a ma@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i@@ f@@ t s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion for the sa@@ k@@ e of the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a and not a real s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to the problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation is a g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on which will en@@ ta@@ i@@ l in@@ no@@ va@@ tions and will bring su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al change to all se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
I fully agree with Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a when he d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation as a p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e re@@ per@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons v@@ ar@@ y acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to specific cases .
although , for many , it is a ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge which g@@ en@@ er@@ a@@ tes w@@ e@@ al@@ th and opportunities , for others , those who have di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in ad@@ ap@@ ting to change or are un@@ able to do so , it is a s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of problems and dis@@ con@@ t@@ ent .
ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ tion to a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al ec@@ on@@ om@@ y has had v@@ ar@@ ying effects on the fisheries sector .
in fact , in s@@ it@@ u@@ ations such as that of S@@ ic@@ il@@ y or S@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i@@ a , some of the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al co@@ a@@ st@@ al f@@ le@@ et@@ s , which have g@@ ro@@ w@@ n up and sur@@ v@@ i@@ v@@ ed in a local context th@@ us far , feel th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed by the impact of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation . the work of such f@@ le@@ et@@ s is f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently the li@@ fe@@ b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d of local com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
therefore , when we t@@ al@@ k of n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations under@@ way within the W@@ or@@ l@@ d T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation on the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of trade , we must take into account the different specific c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing about to@@ ta@@ l li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es which could le@@ a@@ d to ir@@ re@@ par@@ able d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge and the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e sector .
we must , therefore , u@@ p@@ h@@ ol@@ d a ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f policy based on re@@ c@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ al trade , taking into account the fact that , in many countries , im@@ por@@ ts from Europe are subject to non @-@ ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers which ha@@ m@@ p@@ er the s@@ mo@@ o@@ t@@ h f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing of the free market .
mo@@ re@@ over , we must pre@@ v@@ ent the fishing of certain m@@ i@@ gra@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies which , in Europe , are subject to t@@ y@@ ing @-@ up per@@ i@@ od@@ s but which , in other countries , can be f@@ is@@ h@@ ed and then s@@ ol@@ d on the Community market .
it would also be appropriate to re@@ v@@ ise the system of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing trade pre@@ f@@ er@@ ences , for s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es the level of development of third countries no longer j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ ies the g@@ r@@ an@@ ting of these pre@@ f@@ er@@ ences .
finally , we must u@@ p@@ h@@ ol@@ d the European Union policy which makes access to the Community market for products com@@ ing from third countries de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent upon access for the European f@@ le@@ e@@ t to the fishing w@@ a@@ ters of the countries with which we are n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating .
Mr President , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members , on behalf of the Commission , I should first like to thank all the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s , the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies and the other com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es involved for their com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve work in the r@@ u@@ n up to today &apos;s debate .
I should also like to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d special th@@ an@@ ks to the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , for co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating all the work and for his in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing own @-@ initiative report .
Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , you make it quite pla@@ in in your report that it is im@@ possible to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the future of the common fisheries policy without taking account of the b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er ec@@ on@@ om@@ y sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding fisheries .
like every other economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , fisheries are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
I fully en@@ d@@ or@@ se much of what you say in your report and in the resolution at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to it .
you h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the fact that European fishing is com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the principle of m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the principle of a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able fisheries ec@@ on@@ om@@ y which p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ es f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ts the mar@@ ine environment and makes an important contribution to the economic and social st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res of co@@ a@@ st@@ al areas en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in fishing .
I particularly welcome your support in the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against il@@ legal and ir@@ responsible fishing .
we shall have an opportunity to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s Community s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to this b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing issue .
but I can already see that you , too , are in favour of a more res@@ ol@@ u@@ te approach here .
I think that we need further discussion on three points in the report .
first , the report s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s a certain t@@ en@@ d@@ ency towards more protection from international com@@ p@@ et@@ ition on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds that fisheries provide a great many j@@ o@@ b@@ s in certain co@@ a@@ st@@ al areas .
that is certainly t@@ r@@ u@@ e , but if we un@@ il@@ a@@ ter@@ ally in@@ s@@ is@@ t that j@@ o@@ b@@ s must be sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ded s@@ ol@@ el@@ y with the help of the fisheries policy , without taking over@@ all local conditions in a co@@ a@@ st@@ al area into account , then we r@@ u@@ n the r@@ is@@ k , under certain c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , of su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ing in the w@@ r@@ on@@ g di@@ rec@@ tion .
that would be c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive , both for f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and for j@@ o@@ b@@ s .
fisheries needs to st@@ and on their own two f@@ e@@ e@@ t .
this may le@@ a@@ d , in n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous cases , to a re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion in the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o , but when regions are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by such st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ments , then the Community must , of course , help .
the most e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent form of help we can provide is by g@@ i@@ v@@ ing young people a future and o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing them al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve employment to fishing .
secondly , I should like to com@@ ment on the W@@ T@@ O n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations which you m@@ en@@ tion .
as you are aware , we do not yet know if a new W@@ T@@ O r@@ ou@@ n@@ d will even start and , if so , to what ex@@ t@@ ent .
but even if there is a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve r@@ ou@@ n@@ d , I very much d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the Community would be w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to accept re@@ c@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ity in fisheries on the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons at issue , such as in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments or the right of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
until now , only n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es or n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als of an EU Member State have been al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to in@@ v@@ est in the fisheries sector .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly and finally , I should like to re@@ mind you that it has been acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted since the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the common fisheries policy that the Community has one se@@ at and one vote .
this pu@@ re@@ ly n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ical dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge is more than o@@ f@@ f@@ set by the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of having a greater say in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ ing of international fisheries policy .
to su@@ m@@ mar@@ ise , Mr V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a , your report makes an important contribution to the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing debate on the future of the common fisheries policy .
the Commission will certainly take your th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts into ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation in its for@@ th@@ com@@ ing G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er .
that b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to the reports and mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions from Mr G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er and Mr P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant .
both reports start from the same pre@@ mis@@ e .
the fisheries sector in the Community is under e@@ qu@@ al p@@ res@@ sure from se@@ ver@@ al qu@@ ar@@ ters .
f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks are dec@@ l@@ in@@ ing , there is ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity in the f@@ le@@ e@@ t and it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing more and more difficult to access third country w@@ a@@ ters .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that you b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally su@@ b@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to the an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s in the Commission report on the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the system for fisheries in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 @-@ 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that some progress was made - I need only m@@ en@@ tion the f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility in year @-@ to @-@ year st@@ o@@ c@@ k management or the new T@@ A@@ C@@ s in the North S@@ e@@ a for non @-@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies or the regulation on technical measures or the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the V@@ M@@ S - but we still have to ad@@ m@@ it that we have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to re@@ ver@@ se the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve t@@ r@@ end in n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous important st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , such as co@@ d or ha@@ k@@ e .
both ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s also h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the following serious sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s , as i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in the Commission report : e@@ f@@ for@@ t l@@ im@@ it@@ ation has either not wor@@ k@@ ed or has been un@@ sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y , the regulation on technical measures in the Mediterranean has been p@@ at@@ ch@@ il@@ y im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted , the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th M@@ A@@ G@@ P is not n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous enough and control ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents have not been made st@@ r@@ ic@@ ter , as we proposed in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s with various re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the fisheries sector have also s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that we need either to improve or to over@@ ha@@ u@@ l n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous aspects of the fisheries policy if we are to achieve responsible , su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able fisheries .
di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences of opinion no@@ t@@ w@@ i@@ th@@ st@@ an@@ ding , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of those a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted are agreed that we need to do more .
in particular , we need st@@ r@@ ic@@ ter con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s , we need better ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the rules , we need to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce dis@@ c@@ ar@@ ds , we need to promote s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and we need to in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve those a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted , especially the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men themselves , at an e@@ ar@@ li@@ er stage and more in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y when taking decisions on fisheries policy .
the Commission therefore ag@@ re@@ es to the mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions on se@@ ver@@ al points .
however , it has the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion , as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the d@@ el@@ ic@@ ate question of the 6 / 1@@ 2 @-@ m@@ il@@ e z@@ one , that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of those a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted are in favour of ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o .
the Commission will pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h its G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er in a few w@@ e@@ e@@ ks &apos; time , together with the reports under A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 4 par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 2 of R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 3@@ 7@@ 6@@ 0 .
we must use the en@@ su@@ ing debate to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s how to rec@@ ti@@ fy the sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in the reports and su@@ it@@ able s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions for doing so in order to put the fisheries sector in the Community back on a v@@ i@@ able basis .
on the e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of the mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , the main objectives of the reform process i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied by all three ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s are as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws : to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity and improve co@@ h@@ er@@ ence with environmental policy measures in order to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in and r@@ e @-@ establish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks ; to ensure that the people di@@ rec@@ tly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted are more c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y involved in decision making and to res@@ ol@@ ve local or ur@@ g@@ ent problems more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently in order to ensure that the rules are ad@@ he@@ red to and ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed and fisheries management is im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed over@@ all - in other words , e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing which qu@@ al@@ i@@ f@@ ies as good g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance .
then , to c@@ re@@ ate a fisheries sector which is both su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able and ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic@@ ally v@@ i@@ able and in@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve - while at the same time h@@ el@@ p@@ ing those who are for@@ c@@ ed to look el@@ se@@ where for work ; to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p a m@@ od@@ er@@ n f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n fisheries policy which is c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated with other Community policies in order to achieve responsible and ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al use of resources , and , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , to re@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the Mediterranean d@@ im@@ en@@ sion .
this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a &apos;s report on G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u .
this resolution will guarantee the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the Community f@@ le@@ e@@ t in question , while at the same time su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the local sector .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that the rapporteur su@@ p@@ por@@ ts our proposal .
the su@@ m of EUR 6@@ .@@ 5 million now re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d will be used s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally to re@@ st@@ or@@ e the fisheries @-@ re@@ la@@ ted in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions which su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red serious d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge during the ar@@ m@@ ed conflict in G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u .
this will help the Community f@@ le@@ e@@ t to make better use of the agreement .
in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l , we want to support the following ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities : re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the infrastructure , con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s on and monitoring of the f@@ le@@ e@@ t and new re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch programmes .
I should like to make a few com@@ ments here on the terms of pa@@ y@@ ment : a t@@ r@@ an@@ ch@@ e of 5@@ 0 % of the over@@ all a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t will be pa@@ i@@ d out first , as s@@ o@@ on as the government has su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted an action programme .
the re@@ ma@@ in@@ d@@ er , in other words the second h@@ al@@ f , will be pa@@ i@@ d out once G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u has f@@ il@@ ed a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed report on the implementation of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities under the action programme and the use of the funds e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for them .
finally , a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f wor@@ d on the proposed amendments .
proposed A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 1 , 2 and 3 ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the de@@ ad@@ line for im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 .
I think this proposed amendment is both re@@ as@@ on@@ able and j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied and the Commission can therefore support it .
we fully share the concern ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in proposed A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 4 but , as we already in@@ for@@ m the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity of all financial and b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y t@@ r@@ an@@ sa@@ c@@ tions under the terms of our In@@ ter@@ in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , proposed A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 4 is in fact su@@ per@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ous .
as far as the con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to the debate on the current state of n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o are concerned , I should like to thank Parliament for its ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the Commission &apos;s work .
I have to te@@ l@@ l you that the agreement c@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ d de f@@ ac@@ to to apply 1@@ 4 m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago , and that the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can si@@ d@@ e was , unfortunately , not pre@@ pa@@ red to en@@ ter into serious n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ation on a new agreement until the end of O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er last year , in other words , just three and a h@@ al@@ f m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago .
we did , however , make good use of the time up to C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s , with one technical discussion a w@@ e@@ e@@ k in either B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s or R@@ ab@@ at .
n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations were held p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ ally every day in R@@ ab@@ at between 2 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary and 9 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
we really have done our u@@ t@@ most here .
for the re@@ st , it is w@@ r@@ on@@ g to say that we have received no support from the Council .
both the main countries a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted and the presidency have su@@ p@@ por@@ ted us in our efforts and I think that , at the end of the day , the meeting between the K@@ ing of M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o and our Commission President was a u@@ se@@ ful one .
I hope that n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations will again get pro@@ per@@ ly under way , and that h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly we shall s@@ o@@ on be on the h@@ om@@ e st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
thank you , Commissioner .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
Bangladesh
the next it@@ e@@ m is the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate on :
the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 6@@ 0 / 2000 ) by Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s , on behalf of the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation , on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of the C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation A@@ g@@ re@@ ement between the European Community and the P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Bangladesh &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; 7@@ 5@@ 9@@ 5 / 1 / 1999 - C@@ O@@ M ( 1999 ) 1@@ 5@@ 5 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 6 / 2000 - 1999 / 0@@ 0@@ 8@@ 6 ( A@@ C@@ C ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; ;
the or@@ al question ( B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 / 2001 ) by Mr M@@ ir@@ an@@ d@@ a , on behalf of the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation , to the Commission , on Bangladesh .
Mr President , Bangladesh is r@@ ic@@ h and p@@ o@@ or at the same time .
r@@ ic@@ h in human resources , p@@ o@@ or in c@@ ap@@ it@@ al means .
it is one of the world &apos; s p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st and most d@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted countries .
it is re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ted by natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers .
this is why it is important for Europe to give as much aid as possible .
the agreement with the European Union be@@ ar@@ s w@@ it@@ ness to good relations and pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es an excellent b@@ ac@@ k@@ d@@ ro@@ p to st@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ing up development cooperation and trade .
in addition , the agreement la@@ y@@ s the f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ation to the political dialogue which pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es for human rights , good g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s .
on my recent v@@ is@@ it to Bangladesh with Mr M@@ ir@@ an@@ d@@ a , I no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed that they at@@ ta@@ ch far greater importance to relations with Europe than we often re@@ al@@ ise .
the government as well as the op@@ position , but also ac@@ ad@@ em@@ ic@@ s , j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , industry and non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l organisations look up to Europe and ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t a great deal from us , more than A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a , for in@@ st@@ ance .
we should not dis@@ ap@@ point them in this ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion , and make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to promote positive de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments .
the following recent t@@ r@@ en@@ ds can be c@@ ited as f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble : economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th by more than 4 % , a f@@ all in the population increase , f@@ al@@ l@@ ing il@@ l@@ it@@ er@@ ac@@ y and greater participation of women in the political and social ar@@ en@@ as .
this is in con@@ tra@@ st to the fact that the country la@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s under the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of an increase in d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence against women , but also in v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence on the st@@ re@@ et@@ s and in political con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ta@@ tions .
ab@@ used women ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ted for more than 3@@ 0 % of the pa@@ ti@@ ents in a h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al we v@@ is@@ ited .
ch@@ il@@ d la@@ b@@ our is still w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d , despite the recent progress made and initiatives p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by the government and industry .
ma@@ s@@ s @-@ sc@@ al@@ e political st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly bring life in Bangladesh to a st@@ an@@ d@@ still .
F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment is only possible if the government en@@ su@@ res more p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful social conditions .
there is also in@@ st@@ ability p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king .
there is a de@@ e@@ p h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic d@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ st between the two major parties , despite the fact that you can h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly te@@ l@@ l them a@@ part in terms of con@@ t@@ ent .
the op@@ position must re@@ su@@ me its con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive role .
without p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful cooperation between the key parties , the country cannot come out of its political and economic im@@ pa@@ s@@ se .
it is therefore essential for the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing el@@ ec@@ tions to be above bo@@ ar@@ d .
the European Union should not f@@ a@@ i@@ l to s@@ en@@ d ob@@ s@@ er@@ ver@@ s , including members of this Parliament .
in addition to f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ ing and er@@ o@@ sion of the ri@@ v@@ er b@@ an@@ ks , the population is also su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing on a large sc@@ al@@ e from the p@@ o@@ is@@ on@@ ing of d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter .
in principle , the European Union can provide v@@ al@@ u@@ able aid to help al@@ le@@ v@@ i@@ ate all of these problems .
re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ement of the government ap@@ par@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s should take c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e stage in aid pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on .
the state is f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in very many w@@ a@@ y@@ s , especially in the fin@@ ance and education se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
it is un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate that with regard to aid , the European Commission does not have the s@@ ou@@ n@@ d re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion a@@ m@@ on@@ g d@@ on@@ or@@ s which it should really have .
often , funds only become available after long d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s , it at all .
the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation is not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently involved in defin@@ ing the programme .
the sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l le@@ ad@@ s to a lack of su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on in projects .
in sh@@ or@@ t , this is a good , p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al example which il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the need for re@@ for@@ m@@ s in the management sector .
in order to provide e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent aid , it is v@@ it@@ al for the European Commission , the EU Member States and other d@@ on@@ or@@ s to d@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ ta@@ i@@ l their policies .
the many non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l organisations which are present f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l a key role in the implementation of programmes .
the resources are p@@ o@@ ol@@ ed sector @-@ by @-@ sector , which b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and h@@ ar@@ m@@ s European v@@ is@@ i@@ bility . but the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge ou@@ t@@ w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ s the dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
P@@ re@@ m@@ i@@ er H@@ as@@ in@@ a as@@ su@@ red us that the C@@ h@@ it@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ g H@@ il@@ l@@ s peace agreement is being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted to the le@@ t@@ ter .
from our v@@ is@@ it to the s@@ it@@ e , we g@@ le@@ an@@ ed a different im@@ p@@ res@@ sion , if the t@@ r@@ u@@ th be t@@ ol@@ d .
n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the L@@ and Commission n@@ or the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al Council were f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing .
the military p@@ res@@ ence has not let up .
European aid can only be given to this region if su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al progress is made when the peace agreement is being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted , which , unfortunately is not yet the case .
the development of Bangladesh h@@ in@@ g@@ es on the good g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance of the country &apos; s own le@@ ad@@ ers . Europe cannot o@@ f@@ f@@ er an@@ y@@ th@@ ing but aid .
my con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion is that the country should not be as p@@ o@@ or as it is now .
ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly not . if only the country &apos; s resources were better em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed .
Mr President , in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e it to say that I con@@ c@@ u@@ r with Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s , and I would like to take the opportunity to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e how f@@ it@@ t@@ ing Parliament &apos; s re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations are here .
Bangladesh has always been one of those p@@ o@@ or countries which are re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in the n@@ e@@ ws , and the dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers which h@@ it that country are always he@@ ar@@ t @-@ r@@ en@@ ding .
when we now st@@ u@@ d@@ y the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s , we no@@ ti@@ ce that , all of a su@@ d@@ d@@ en , the country could be con@@ si@@ de@@ red a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s st@@ or@@ y , with economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of 5 % of the G@@ N@@ P per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a , with g@@ ro@@ w@@ th in ex@@ por@@ t of no less than 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 8 % in the fi@@ ve years between 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , and even bo@@ a@@ st@@ ing a dec@@ re@@ a@@ se in the population g@@ ro@@ w@@ th .
M@@ others now have three children in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of se@@ v@@ en .
in sh@@ or@@ t , you could be for@@ given for th@@ in@@ king that e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is mo@@ v@@ ing in the right di@@ rec@@ tion , but , of course , this is the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence between a country which is very , very , very p@@ o@@ or and a country which is only very , very p@@ o@@ or .
it re@@ ma@@ in@@ s a problem if you re@@ al@@ ise that 6@@ 0 million people li@@ ve under the p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty line , and you have economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th which cannot k@@ e@@ e@@ p up with the population g@@ ro@@ w@@ th .
out of the 1@@ 6@@ 2 countries on the Human D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment In@@ de@@ x , Bangladesh does not come last , but 1@@ 4@@ 5@@ th , which is very sa@@ d indeed .
so we welcome this t@@ ol@@ l @-@ free access of the country &apos; s g@@ o@@ od@@ s into the European market .
we think that this will have a f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble impact , but we believe that we , ourselves , should make a greater e@@ f@@ for@@ t to , for example , b@@ re@@ a@@ the new life into the j@@ u@@ te organisation which di@@ ed a death .
finally , I , too , would ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for more use to be made of the human rights c@@ la@@ use which is en@@ c@@ ap@@ su@@ la@@ ted in the first ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le of the agreement , so as to re@@ al@@ ise those aspects which Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed so el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently .
Mr President , Commissioner , today , at last , we have an opportunity to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our opinion on the new cooperation agreement con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded with Bangladesh .
our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Member and rapporteur , Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s , with w@@ h@@ o@@ m I v@@ is@@ ited that country last year , has already st@@ a@@ ted that we have ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed this .
but he also ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed some of the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts of the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation as to what the Community &apos; s future action in Bangladesh should be .
without w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to re@@ p@@ e@@ at what has already been st@@ a@@ ted , I would n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t some issues , on which we would also like to he@@ a@@ r the Commission &apos; s th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts .
this is the most he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted of the so @-@ called &apos; less @-@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries &apos; .
the f@@ ra@@ g@@ il@@ ity of its economic situation , mar@@ k@@ ed by the pre@@ d@@ om@@ in@@ ance of the pr@@ im@@ ary sector , which in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 6@@ 5 % of the working population , and also the ac@@ u@@ t@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of social problems , are h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted by the most v@@ ar@@ i@@ ed in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s . and as if this were not enough , there are also the ter@@ ri@@ ble dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers that con@@ st@@ an@@ tly a@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ t the country .
in addition to these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s , the political situation , as has already been mentioned , still s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s a wor@@ r@@ ying de@@ g@@ re@@ e of in@@ st@@ ability on all c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts .
we were able to con@@ f@@ ir@@ m this for ourselves during our v@@ is@@ it to this still young country . we sa@@ w the w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty and the problems f@@ ac@@ ing health and education but also some p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities that are op@@ en@@ ing up , such as initiatives ar@@ is@@ ing from cooperation , which are taking place at every level , either under the a@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ es of the government or which are being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted by N@@ G@@ O@@ s , the in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing use of m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ re@@ d@@ it , even though it b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its l@@ im@@ ited n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of people , and the role and the particularly difficult situation of women .
we also sa@@ w the dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s effects of er@@ o@@ sion and of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ s , and also the d@@ an@@ g@@ ers and consequences of the h@@ u@@ ge environmental and health dis@@ a@@ st@@ er c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by the p@@ res@@ ence of ar@@ s@@ en@@ ic in d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter .
we were also able to see the sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s in the political ar@@ en@@ a , which were quite clear in the c@@ li@@ ma@@ te of great v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence that mar@@ ks relations between the government of Mrs H@@ as@@ in@@ a W@@ a@@ j@@ ed of the A@@ w@@ an@@ i L@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e and the op@@ position , particularly the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t Party of Bangladesh , which does not par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate on a re@@ gu@@ la@@ r basis in the work of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
we also sa@@ w the problems and d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the conflict with the people in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n part of the country , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally the C@@ h@@ it@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ g H@@ il@@ l T@@ ra@@ c@@ ts .
as you all know , the European Union is Bangladesh &apos; s main tra@@ ding par@@ t@@ n@@ er .
ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 4@@ 5 % of that country &apos; s ex@@ por@@ ts come to the European Union .
Bangladesh has also b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ited from various development in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , such as aid for technical and financial cooperation with A@@ si@@ an countries , food and h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid and ex@@ em@@ p@@ tion from c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s d@@ u@@ ti@@ es on ex@@ por@@ ts .
the European Union has also pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed Bangladesh with a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of external aid that has been e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for it and on which , in fact , the country is he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent .
we also know that the current agreement c@@ ar@@ ri@@ es on from the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 6 agreement , and can be ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to future needs .
the question we now f@@ ac@@ e now with regard to the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es I have just d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed is to know what real objectives and priorities this new agreement h@@ op@@ es to achieve and in general , what effects we hope to have on su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development in the field of ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion and on the participation of the public and public organisations in national life .
in the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation , we in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated the di@@ rec@@ tions that we f@@ el@@ t to be the most appropriate .
Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s has already mentioned them in his s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h .
we now hope that the Commission will ex@@ p@@ res@@ s its agreement or dis@@ agreement with the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es that we proposed .
we also hope , however , that the Commission will state to what ex@@ t@@ ent it will be w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to provide political support for Bangladesh in order to over@@ come the problems to which I re@@ f@@ er@@ red e@@ ar@@ li@@ er .
given the re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s that the government and the op@@ position have already made we would also like the Commission to te@@ l@@ l us how it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to support the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al process and whether it will be s@@ en@@ ding a mis@@ sion to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve the el@@ ec@@ tions that have already been s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for this year .
Mr President , let me first of all say that I feel it is a p@@ ri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s these matters , as we are doing here on the basis of your report .
for me it re@@ p@@ res@@ ents a s@@ or@@ t of i@@ d@@ y@@ l@@ li@@ c political con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s .
we agree on your report and we welcome it very much and this is not just n@@ ice , it is also really v@@ al@@ u@@ able for Bangladesh and other par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
it is very u@@ se@@ ful that we in Europe should prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ly agree on how to work with our par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
if we were dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing a@@ im@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly without any s@@ or@@ t of di@@ rec@@ tion , they would not have a good par@@ t@@ n@@ er , so it is really important that we agree .
a year ago I d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly ch@@ o@@ s@@ e Bangladesh as my first d@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ ation on a n@@ or@@ ma@@ l b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l field t@@ ri@@ p .
we w@@ ent there after the U@@ N@@ C@@ T@@ A@@ D con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in B@@ an@@ g@@ k@@ o@@ k .
I w@@ an@@ ted to go to a non @-@ A@@ C@@ P L@@ D@@ C country to start in the right place .
I also w@@ an@@ ted to start in a country as Commissioner doing field t@@ ri@@ p@@ s , a country that I k@@ new well already in order to better be able to as@@ se@@ s@@ s how the Commission wor@@ ks .
if I w@@ ent to a country I did not know , there would be too many dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ons , but this one I k@@ new quite well and I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to say that I was p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y sur@@ pr@@ ised by what I sa@@ w in the field .
we were c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the p@@ o@@ or women , we were further out in the v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es than I had ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted and we wor@@ k@@ ed more through B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i N@@ G@@ O@@ s than I had ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted .
this is a good basis and also one of the reasons why Parliament and Commission are in h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y about where we go now .
there are b@@ i@@ g problems to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s with the Government of Bangladesh , no@@ ta@@ b@@ ly its in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency : it per@@ for@@ m@@ s as b@@ ad@@ ly as the Commission , so the two of them have a l@@ o@@ t to t@@ al@@ k about , but we know that and we are clear about it sa@@ ying &quot; our d@@ el@@ i@@ very problems are clear and well @-@ k@@ no@@ w@@ n , but p@@ le@@ a@@ se do not ad@@ d to them by also being s@@ l@@ o@@ w and un@@ clear in your decision @-@ taking process . &quot;
this is why the new agreement that we are now dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing on is so important , because it , in fact , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s cooperation one st@@ e@@ p further forward and c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ies priorities .
we will go from one country to another ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the world and bring what we are doing up to n@@ or@@ ma@@ l st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds concerning the basis of cooperation and priorities .
so this is all very good
as to the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons that have been put concerning the el@@ ec@@ tions , on 2@@ 7 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary we are s@@ en@@ ding the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment te@@ am from the Commission over there and we will be re@@ ad@@ y , w@@ il@@ l@@ ing and e@@ ag@@ er to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of Parliament in an ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity .
if this is what we finally dec@@ i@@ d@@ e to do , we think it may be very u@@ se@@ ful .
Bangladesh has done quite a number of v@@ al@@ u@@ able things in recent years : re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally , ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing more with her n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s and ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ ing s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to very ol@@ d problems .
as to the C@@ h@@ it@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ g H@@ il@@ l t@@ ri@@ b@@ es , we take the view that the issue there is mo@@ v@@ ing too s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly .
I c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied this when I was there in F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary last year .
on the other hand , problems re@@ la@@ ting to land @-@ o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p and other things are very difficult to s@@ ol@@ ve in any country .
the att@@ it@@ u@@ de is important and I believe they are t@@ r@@ ying to do something m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful .
what Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s has mentioned concerning d@@ on@@ or co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation and the many N@@ G@@ O@@ s in Bangladesh is in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing and important .
many in@@ no@@ va@@ tions have taken place there .
m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ re@@ d@@ it is a great ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement and it is not only one very f@@ a@@ m@@ ous organisation that has been su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
but I would come back , when we t@@ al@@ k about development in Bangladesh , to the role of women .
this is quite re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ ble .
their ability to change the life and the situation of f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies is ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary , but I would , in fact , point to the many young women and g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s in the te@@ x@@ ti@@ le f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies who in a st@@ r@@ an@@ ge way re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the c@@ ha@@ o@@ ti@@ c way of m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ is@@ ation .
the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve - not having j@@ o@@ b@@ s - is quite pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ al , but the k@@ in@@ ds of j@@ o@@ b@@ s they have are also very pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ al .
at the end of the day our li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation , the access for them to our market , is part of the hope of these women and of Bangladesh , so I think we are on the right tra@@ c@@ k and I very much ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the support and the agreement that we have on what to do in Bangladesh .
Mr President , I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to be able to speak in this debate on European Union cooperation with Bangladesh , a country I know well , a country I was pr@@ ou@@ d to v@@ is@@ it with the European Parliament &apos;s d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in the a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
there are , of course , a great number of people with B@@ en@@ g@@ al@@ i ro@@ o@@ t@@ s se@@ t@@ t@@ led in L@@ on@@ d@@ on and other par@@ ts of the European Union , people or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ally from D@@ ha@@ k@@ a , S@@ y@@ l@@ h@@ e@@ t and other par@@ ts of Bangladesh .
I know from them and from my v@@ is@@ it that Bangladesh is a country of pr@@ ou@@ d , h@@ ar@@ d @-@ working people and a country with great pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts , but one which does need assistance from the more w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed par@@ ts of the world like the European Union .
this report h@@ el@@ p@@ s provide that support and should be com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed , and acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly I pa@@ y w@@ ar@@ m t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the rapporteur and my other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e .
but the rapporteur said something which st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k me , as did Mrs M@@ a@@ es .
the rapporteur said that state st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res in Bangladesh work b@@ ad@@ ly and Mrs M@@ a@@ es d@@ er@@ i@@ d@@ ed some of the ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ es that Bangladesh has made in recent years .
yet in many w@@ a@@ y@@ s I think that Bangladesh is a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing for the way that it does work .
it does work despite its t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ul@@ ent and v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y , despite the political problems , despite its other di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es and despite the p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
it does f@@ un@@ c@@ tion and , as the Commissioner has just said , that is a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing all the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
I believe that this is f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally a c@@ re@@ d@@ it to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh .
now on the positive si@@ d@@ e - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - Bangladesh has la@@ te@@ ly been ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted as a full te@@ st c@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ t pla@@ ying n@@ ation .
perhaps more si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly , res@@ er@@ v@@ es of natural g@@ as have now been dis@@ co@@ v@@ e@@ red in the B@@ a@@ y of B@@ en@@ g@@ al .
the European Parliament has to help ensure that Bangladesh is not ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited by the b@@ i@@ g m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ in@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , that it is able to use its res@@ er@@ v@@ es pro@@ per@@ ly and to s@@ el@@ l them at the most com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve pr@@ ice , which may not mean just to In@@ di@@ a or to R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a .
the c@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ t as@@ p@@ ec@@ t may se@@ e@@ m ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant but it does s@@ how a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed and Bangladesh will do well in this field of te@@ st c@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ t and this will be an in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion to m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of people in that country .
the report makes it clear that if the European Union wor@@ ks in par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p with local people it can help on b@@ i@@ g issues .
it can help with family pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing , the key to st@@ ability for Bangladesh .
a p@@ o@@ or or de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing country cannot su@@ st@@ a@@ in a b@@ ir@@ th ra@@ te above two children per w@@ om@@ an .
the idea that a large family is a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally the r@@ ou@@ te out of p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty must be er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ated and women , all women , must be able to c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e whether or not to have children .
European com@@ p@@ an@@ ies must also make certain that they do not ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it the c@@ he@@ a@@ p la@@ b@@ our and do not con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally per@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ ate the working environment in f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies , where the women su@@ f@@ f@@ er and work very long h@@ ou@@ r@@ s for very little money .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more the European Union has the ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise to help with other problems in Bangladesh - the f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ ing that we have he@@ ar@@ d about , that d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ s great s@@ w@@ a@@ th@@ es of the land on a re@@ gu@@ la@@ r basis is not in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able .
Europe has the know @-@ how to pre@@ v@@ ent the de@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ ation .
we have the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , for example in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , to help improve l@@ o@@ w @-@ l@@ ying land and land su@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ ble to f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ ing .
we , as a European Union , already help Bangladesh with g@@ r@@ an@@ ts , with least @-@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed country st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s , and with the pre@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ al access to mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts that this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s with it .
but we can , I believe , and we must do more .
the future of Bangladesh also de@@ pen@@ ds on its y@@ ou@@ th .
to my mind too many of the young people in Bangladesh le@@ a@@ ve to be ed@@ u@@ c@@ ated ab@@ road in Europe and the United States , which I com@@ m@@ en@@ d , which is good ; but then many of them do not go back to Bangladesh to take back their education , their ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence and their great st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th .
we must encourage them to do so .
I will end as I be@@ g@@ an , by sa@@ ying that Bangladesh is a country with a future .
just as the last part of the t@@ w@@ en@@ ti@@ et@@ h c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ed to the countries of s@@ ou@@ th @-@ e@@ a@@ st A@@ si@@ a , the T@@ i@@ g@@ er ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies , I believe that the first part of this c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y can b@@ el@@ on@@ g to the countries of s@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ a .
with help from this Parliament , Bangladesh can share in that s@@ en@@ se of b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing , in the w@@ e@@ al@@ th , the pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s that will bring .
n@@ or do re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous w@@ ar@@ s . however , it also means that it would be still wor@@ se if we were to let down just such a country , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because Bangladesh does not have a number of the problems we see in other countries , and we should be f@@ a@@ il@@ ing the country if we were not to com@@ m@@ it a good deal in terms of aid , including development aid .
Bangladesh can only h@@ ol@@ d its own if we are w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to help the country , and that means both the EU , as the Commissioner mentioned , and also the Member States , a@@ m@@ on@@ g which I can call attention to my own country , D@@ en@@ mar@@ k , which is one of the l@@ ar@@ g@@ est pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ers of aid in the area .
there are three points I should like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e in addition to the general need for aid and development .
there is the need for good g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ance and support for democracy .
others have t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed upon these , so I shall not com@@ ment further upon them .
there is the need to continue h@@ el@@ p@@ ing to promote women &apos; s in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence , for example by con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing further our support for m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ re@@ d@@ its .
women su@@ f@@ f@@ er a good deal of op@@ p@@ res@@ sion in Bangladesh and , as a number of s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have already p@@ o@@ in@@ ted this out I shall not go into any more de@@ ta@@ i@@ l on this subject either .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , I should like to say that women were p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y those who le@@ f@@ t me fe@@ el@@ ing most en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged following my v@@ is@@ it .
however , I should like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e our need to make further progress now .
we cannot be sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with m@@ ic@@ ro@@ c@@ re@@ d@@ its . we must mo@@ ve on to the next p@@ ha@@ se of development , whether it be concerned with te@@ x@@ ti@@ l@@ es or something el@@ se .
I come , then , to my third point , which the Commissioner perhaps ta@@ k@@ es a rather different view of .
I believe that , in this context , we can perhaps make use of information and com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ations te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y in order to support women too - since they are now a ma@@ in@@ st@@ a@@ y of society - and so as to give a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to their cause and , all in all , to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the country &apos; s further development .
Mr President , we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an a@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion of the good relations between the European Union and Bangladesh and pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a framework for their further ex@@ p@@ an@@ sion .
A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 7 of the agreement de@@ als with regional cooperation , and I would firstly like to t@@ ou@@ ch on two points which re@@ la@@ te to Bangladesh &apos;s regional situation and her re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing countries .
although there is still some t@@ en@@ sion in b@@ order areas with In@@ di@@ a , there has been a great im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in relations between the two countries .
e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of this has been the si@@ g@@ nature of the w@@ a@@ ter sh@@ ar@@ ing Treaty with In@@ di@@ a .
following this there has been an in@@ te@@ ri@@ m agreement for sh@@ ar@@ ing the w@@ a@@ ters of the T@@ is@@ t@@ a ri@@ v@@ er and In@@ di@@ an assistance in pre@@ par@@ ing the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t report on the proposed G@@ an@@ g@@ es b@@ ar@@ ra@@ ge which will be l@@ o@@ c@@ ated on B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y .
the two countries have also rec@@ ently be@@ gu@@ n t@@ al@@ ks on fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ s which have d@@ el@@ u@@ ged both countries with tra@@ g@@ i@@ c consequences .
this cooperation is good n@@ e@@ ws and to be en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged and su@@ p@@ por@@ ted .
I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e authorities .
in fact , in the last few d@@ a@@ y@@ s , there have been t@@ ro@@ o@@ p de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ments by the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e in support of B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t a d@@ am on the N@@ a@@ f ri@@ v@@ er c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to the Bangladesh b@@ order , si@@ x@@ ty m@@ il@@ es s@@ ou@@ th e@@ a@@ st of C@@ o@@ x &apos;s B@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ r .
in the past , such actions have re@@ su@@ l@@ ted in military action .
a particularly re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of this ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity is that an@@ t@@ i @-@ per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l l@@ an@@ d@@ min@@ es have re@@ por@@ te@@ d@@ ly been la@@ i@@ d al@@ on@@ g the b@@ order by the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e .
Bangladesh is the only s@@ ou@@ th A@@ si@@ an country to have si@@ g@@ n@@ ed the O@@ t@@ ta@@ w@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion b@@ an@@ n@@ ing these weapons .
D@@ e@@ pl@@ or@@ ab@@ ly , M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r is not a si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ y to the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion and there are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations that she has pl@@ an@@ ted min@@ es in@@ si@@ d@@ e B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y including on agricultural land .
M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r should acc@@ ed@@ e to the min@@ e b@@ an Treaty im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly and Bangladesh should take st@@ e@@ p@@ s to ra@@ ti@@ fy the Treaty .
I hope the Commission and Council will pu@@ r@@ su@@ e these points in their de@@ al@@ in@@ g@@ s with both countries .
on a se@@ par@@ ate matter , the report d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es the impact of population g@@ ro@@ w@@ th in Bangladesh on food security and economic development .
the population of 1@@ 2@@ 7 million is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to g@@ ro@@ w to over 2@@ 00 million by 2@@ 0@@ 3@@ 0 .
this re@@ p@@ res@@ ents a h@@ u@@ ge pu@@ s@@ h f@@ ac@@ to@@ r for em@@ i@@ gra@@ tion including to the European Union .
Bangladesh must f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the r@@ e @-@ ad@@ mis@@ sion of n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als who are il@@ le@@ g@@ ally in the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of an EU Member State .
this is rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised in the dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to the cooperation agreement .
it is important that the Government of Bangladesh should take e@@ ar@@ ly st@@ e@@ p@@ s to en@@ ter into n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with those Member States that so wish and to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ ally acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble r@@ e @-@ ad@@ mis@@ sion ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
I t@@ r@@ u@@ st the Commission will also at@@ ta@@ ch importance to this .
Mr President , I would first like to say a few words about the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion of j@@ u@@ te organisations and Bangladesh &apos;s role as a h@@ o@@ s@@ t of the ol@@ d organisation .
a year ago there were quite d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c problems and I t@@ ri@@ ed to see if it were possible to re@@ j@@ u@@ v@@ en@@ ate the ol@@ d organisation .
there was no agreement between our Member States to do what we in the Commission would have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to do , which ex@@ pla@@ in@@ s the p@@ ha@@ se that we have been going through with this organisation .
the good n@@ e@@ ws , however , is that the need has been acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted for a special e@@ f@@ for@@ t , based in Bangladesh I hope , to promote the use and new u@@ se@@ s of j@@ u@@ te as a ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al , so perhaps it is now possible to continue with the su@@ b@@ st@@ ance of what the ol@@ d j@@ u@@ te organisation could do .
there was a meeting in D@@ ha@@ k@@ a at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and all the different parties agreed to c@@ re@@ ate what is called an international j@@ u@@ te st@@ u@@ d@@ y group .
the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t proposal for the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion of this b@@ od@@ y will be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed and h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly fin@@ al@@ is@@ ed at the meeting of the In@@ ter@@ national J@@ u@@ te O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation to be held in D@@ ha@@ k@@ a at the end of this m@@ on@@ th .
su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently it will be su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to U@@ N@@ C@@ T@@ A@@ D in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a and , once adopted , s@@ ent for si@@ g@@ n@@ ing and ra@@ ti@@ fication to the governments concerned and the UN t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es se@@ c@@ tion .
so we now have very high h@@ op@@ es that a new b@@ od@@ y that can promote r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ed international cooperation in the j@@ u@@ te sector will come out of the long pa@@ in@@ ful discussion about the ol@@ d j@@ u@@ te organisation .
this is very good because the In@@ ter@@ national J@@ u@@ te O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation is the only international organisation of this kind that is actually based in a least @-@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed country .
this is what I can report on this matter that was b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t up in our discussion here .
to Mrs D@@ j@@ u@@ b@@ k@@ a@@ er I would say : y@@ es , it is a st@@ r@@ on@@ g as@@ set for Bangladesh that it is a n@@ ation and we defin@@ it@@ el@@ y should encourage the use of that p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al .
the C@@ h@@ it@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ g H@@ il@@ l T@@ ra@@ c@@ ts problem is a ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge to that p@@ ic@@ ture of Bangladesh but for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ te@@ ly , com@@ pa@@ red to the past , the t@@ en@@ si@@ ons are l@@ o@@ w@@ er and they still se@@ e@@ m set on the right course .
as to the role of I@@ T in Bangladesh , y@@ es of course we will t@@ r@@ y to be u@@ se@@ ful and do something but I do not h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ ly see it as an e@@ as@@ y sh@@ or@@ t@@ c@@ u@@ t , so we will st@@ ic@@ k to the b@@ a@@ si@@ c priorities of our agreement with Bangladesh .
but we will use I@@ T in all possible ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations .
as to what you say about f@@ o@@ c@@ using s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally on women in this respect , I would say that Bangladesh may be one of the pla@@ c@@ es where it would be possible to ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent with this .
so we should be open to these p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
I agree very much with what Mr v@@ an O@@ r@@ d@@ en said about the regional aspects .
it se@@ em@@ s that Bangladesh is the n@@ ice gu@@ y ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d and we certainly should rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise this as a fact and we should re@@ la@@ te to Bangladesh in that per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
it has n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s who are not all very e@@ as@@ y and the whole region is more pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c than we may often think .
there are some el@@ even million B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i li@@ v@@ ing il@@ le@@ g@@ ally in In@@ di@@ a .
that is a large number in a European context , so from the point of view of st@@ ability , d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ t@@ is@@ ation , or@@ d@@ er@@ ly el@@ ec@@ tions and so on , it really is f@@ ac@@ ing quite some ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es .
let me once again thank you for this very positive debate .
I look forward to working with Parliament on our relations with Bangladesh .
things are mo@@ v@@ ing so ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly there that com@@ pa@@ red to the past we may be able in just a few years to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t and to de@@ te@@ c@@ t real ch@@ an@@ g@@ es as a result of our cooperation there , and it is a great in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion .
finally , we look forward very much to w@@ el@@ com@@ ing Bangladesh as one of the le@@ ad@@ ing par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts in our con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in M@@ a@@ y in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s on L@@ D@@ C@@ s , to be held with U@@ N@@ C@@ T@@ A@@ D .
this will be a b@@ i@@ g opportunity for Bangladesh and the other least @-@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries to present themselves not as pa@@ ti@@ ents on a si@@ c@@ k b@@ ed in h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al , with the re@@ st of the world l@@ o@@ o@@ king at them like c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , but as par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al society , re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res and p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ als which are important in k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing al@@ i@@ ve the di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
so we are also l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to that par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
the first E@@ C @-@ Bangladesh J@@ o@@ in@@ t Committee meeting under the new cooperation agreement is now pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed for the first h@@ al@@ f of M@@ ar@@ ch 2001 , so the tra@@ in is on the mo@@ ve .
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pu@@ r@@ su@@ ant to A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 4@@ 2 ( 5 ) .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was c@@ l@@ o@@ sed at 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 4@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
use of depleted uranium in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o ( B@@ al@@ k@@ an s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e )
the next it@@ e@@ m is the Council and Commission dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations on the use of depleted uranium in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
I shall give the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr D@@ an@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ s@@ on st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ta@@ way .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the Commission , the information concerning health r@@ is@@ ks p@@ o@@ sed by depleted uranium to the population and to st@@ a@@ f@@ f in peace @-@ making mis@@ si@@ ons in the Balkans , as well as its possible environmental consequences , has c@@ a@@ u@@ sed great concern in Europe .
it is a concern which must be taken with the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness .
the issue ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ated by organisations and institutions with com@@ p@@ et@@ ence within this area .
in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er of last year , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the United N@@ ations E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me ( U@@ N@@ E@@ P ) and of the In@@ ter@@ national A@@ t@@ om@@ ic E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y A@@ g@@ ency ( I@@ A@@ E@@ A ) v@@ is@@ ited K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
U@@ N@@ E@@ P has been working for some time on a report on the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical and ra@@ di@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical consequences of the use of depleted uranium in the Balkans .
we welcome this report , together with the report which the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation ( W@@ H@@ O ) is at present in the process of com@@ p@@ il@@ ing on the same subject .
the issue of possible health r@@ is@@ ks to those s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers who take part in peace @-@ making efforts in the Balkans is ma@@ in@@ ly a responsibility for NATO and par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating States .
the EU countries which take part in these mis@@ si@@ ons do so on the basis of national decisions .
in the interests of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st possible transparency on the issue , v@@ i@@ e@@ ws are , however , being ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed within re@@ le@@ v@@ ant con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tive bo@@ di@@ es .
a discussion is to take place over l@@ u@@ n@@ ch during the meeting with the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council on 2@@ 2 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
this also re@@ min@@ ds us of how important it is that the effects upon health and the environment of military crisis management initiatives should be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed now that the EU is de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing its crisis management c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity .
this is a natural part of a crisis management organisation &apos; s ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities , and work of this kind is being done both within NATO and the W@@ EU , as well as within the UN .
the issue of the possible health r@@ is@@ ks and environmental consequences involved in the use of depleted uranium also d@@ ra@@ ws attention to a very important issue : that of the general environmental problems in the Balkans .
the p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions of K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and other war @-@ t@@ or@@ n countries in the Balkans have been s@@ o@@ re@@ ly t@@ ri@@ ed , with tra@@ g@@ i@@ c and long @-@ term consequences .
it is in the interests of Europe as a whole to over@@ come these consequences in cooperation with the governments in the region , which are all d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c and peace @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ted .
through the Commission &apos; s aid programme , the EU is o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to g@@ ri@@ p@@ s with their environmental problems .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am de@@ e@@ p@@ ly gra@@ te@@ ful to you for g@@ i@@ v@@ ing me the opportunity to speak on a matter which I believe , as I am sure you will agree , ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es to be de@@ al@@ t with as a matter of to@@ p priority by Parliament .
it is only right that we should be concerned for the health of our military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l , of the citizens of the Balkans and of those working for Community institutions , non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l institutions , international organisations and Member State organisations op@@ er@@ ating in the area .
I therefore share the an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed regarding the health of all these people .
I should like to be@@ g@@ in by ex@@ p@@ res@@ sing my s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with all those who are ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing health problems , who are concerned about their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies and who are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from il@@ l@@ ness .
the fact is that there are many such in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als and they are ent@@ it@@ led to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the best c@@ are available .
they have the right to be in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of the cause of their con@@ d@@ ition without d@@ el@@ a@@ y , and we shall de@@ vote all our energy to doing so .
we are all under an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to do what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to ensure that the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant information is available to those concerned .
I st@@ and before you today as S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al of the Council , but I am also here in my c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity as the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive for the Union &apos; s F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n and S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y .
in de@@ al@@ ing with the matters which have given r@@ ise to concern in the House , I shall en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our to do so from the Council &apos; s point of view .
I should first like to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate my per@@ s@@ on@@ al commitment and the commitment of all Members of Council to this region , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the Balkans .
I am sure they will make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to help c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the situation .
our st@@ a@@ tes are d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es , they have nothing to h@@ i@@ d@@ e , and it is our in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to forward Parliament all the information available at any given time .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al issue we are con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted with is to establish clearly whether there is a l@@ in@@ k between the use of these weapons and the il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses no@@ ti@@ fied by the t@@ ro@@ op@@ s or by those who s@@ er@@ v@@ ed in peace @-@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing op@@ er@@ ations in the Balkans , or whether , on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , the in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ence of these il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses is no different from that u@@ su@@ ally rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st our t@@ ro@@ op@@ s .
this is the question we have to an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
if we are to provide a clear an@@ s@@ w@@ er to it , we must pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed in as ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al a m@@ an@@ n@@ er as possible .
we should in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate : if this really were a s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e in the et@@ y@@ m@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical s@@ en@@ se of the wor@@ d , then all those a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted would s@@ how si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om@@ s . in time , those s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om@@ s would de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p in a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r way , and the ou@@ t@@ come would also be si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r .
that is what is g@@ en@@ er@@ ally under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d by the wor@@ d s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e .
so these are the in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations we must se@@ e@@ k and we should deal with them in a fully open and trans@@ par@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
all of us involved in e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing the t@@ r@@ u@@ th must b@@ a@@ se our con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons on f@@ ac@@ ts and not on m@@ er@@ e as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tions .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , if we are to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the f@@ ac@@ ts , we must have access to all the information available .
we must make a particular point of f@@ o@@ st@@ er@@ ing op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s and transparency a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st ourselves .
once we are aware of the f@@ ac@@ ts , we should st@@ u@@ d@@ y them in such a way that all the results we make public g@@ en@@ er@@ ate c@@ al@@ m and in@@ s@@ p@@ ir@@ e con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
our work is indeed in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ red by this s@@ p@@ ir@@ it .
such op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s and transparency must be common to all : they must per@@ m@@ e@@ ate all the Member States of the European Union , re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s between the Member States of the Union and NATO , and those between NATO and other al@@ l@@ ies involved in peace @-@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing op@@ er@@ ations in the Balkans .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly they must also ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ise re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s between governments in the region .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , the European Union &apos; s P@@ ol@@ it@@ ical and S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity Committee de@@ al@@ t with this matter on 9 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
Member States s@@ ha@@ red their concerns and information on the measures each had taken , as the current presidency st@@ a@@ ted .
there was b@@ road agreement that NATO , as the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion that had as@@ su@@ m@@ ed responsibility for h@@ an@@ d@@ ling the B@@ al@@ k@@ an crisis , should be ch@@ ar@@ ged with as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ling information from all those involved regarding the use of depleted uranium , the l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of military con@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ ents , and all m@@ ed@@ ical d@@ at@@ a .
as you are aware , ladies and gentlemen , at that meeting the Commission also ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed the measures it in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to take . I am sure that the Commission will today be able to su@@ p@@ p@@ ly information on the measures it has taken , either through Commissioner W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m or through her re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive .
we have re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed in con@@ st@@ ant con@@ ta@@ c@@ t ever since . the S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al , his as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ ts and the Council &apos; s as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ ts have en@@ su@@ red that we have all k@@ e@@ p@@ t each other as well @-@ in@@ for@@ m@@ ed and up to d@@ ate with de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments as possible .
allow me to rec@@ all b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly the measures taken by NATO at its meeting on 1@@ 0 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary : first , it con@@ v@@ en@@ ed a meeting of national military m@@ ed@@ ical ex@@ per@@ ts to allow them to make con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with each other and ex@@ change the whole g@@ a@@ m@@ u@@ t of i@@ d@@ e@@ as , b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d information , objectives , et@@ c . a working group was set up im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly to s@@ er@@ ve as a for@@ u@@ m for ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing information .
h@@ ence the matter was raised with the Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister , Mr G@@ or@@ an S@@ v@@ il@@ an@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ c , on 1@@ 0 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary . he was as@@ su@@ red that all of us , especially NATO , would forward all available information .
in addition , it was agreed to make all information concerning this in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent available to the United N@@ ations E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , as you are aware , NATO members re@@ it@@ er@@ ated their view that at that time there was no e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence to su@@ g@@ g@@ est that the use of the weapons in question con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ted a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant r@@ is@@ k for the ar@@ m@@ ed for@@ c@@ es of the countries involved , or for the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population of the Balkans .
it is therefore re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to su@@ b@@ m@@ it all the necessary information to the European Union . it fully in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to do so , to en@@ able better qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied organisations , no@@ ta@@ b@@ ly the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation , the United N@@ ations E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me and the In@@ ter@@ national A@@ t@@ om@@ ic E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y A@@ g@@ ency to draw the appropriate con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons .
as you know ladies and gentlemen , NATO &apos; s M@@ ed@@ ical Committee held its first meeting on M@@ on@@ day 1@@ 5 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , and the n@@ e@@ w@@ ly e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed group for the ex@@ change of information m@@ e@@ t for the first time y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day .
you are aware of the ou@@ t@@ come of that in@@ it@@ i@@ al discussion , it has been pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed and pla@@ c@@ ed on the NATO w@@ e@@ b s@@ it@@ e , together with the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c d@@ at@@ a ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed at y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day &apos; s meeting .
I think it is wor@@ th em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ing once again that , at NATO &apos; s su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion , m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the group de@@ al@@ ing with the ex@@ change of information will be open to all fi@@ f@@ te@@ en Member States of the European Union , and that ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m transparency is fully gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed .
as the presidency has cor@@ rec@@ tly st@@ a@@ ted , the next st@@ e@@ p will be to re@@ view the b@@ od@@ y of s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al as it b@@ ec@@ om@@ es available . together with Mr P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister and President of Council , Union F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n M@@ in@@ is@@ ters will also deal with the matter at the first meeting of the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council on 2@@ 2 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that this is a s@@ en@@ si@@ ble way of pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing at the moment , to ensure that we as@@ se@@ m@@ ble all the information re@@ qu@@ i@@ red and ar@@ ri@@ ve at con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons s@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ly based on f@@ ac@@ ts .
as you may i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine , I have re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed in con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the governments of all Member States , and I must say to you , quite s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly , that if a report p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing to a possible l@@ in@@ k does em@@ er@@ ge , I will per@@ s@@ on@@ ally see that it is for@@ w@@ ar@@ ded to the House . I pr@@ om@@ ise you that .
I should , however , state that to d@@ ate , the Council has not received a s@@ in@@ g@@ le s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c report e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a l@@ in@@ k between these il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses and the use of depleted uranium weapons .
let me st@@ res@@ s once more , ladies and gentlemen , that if such a report does em@@ er@@ ge you will be made aware of it im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
I should m@@ en@@ tion that since I was called to ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r before the House , that is , in the last few d@@ a@@ y@@ s and h@@ ou@@ r@@ s , some countries have su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c reports .
I re@@ f@@ er for example to the reports su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted by the Committee of the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ al N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r M@@ on@@ it@@ or@@ ing A@@ g@@ ency . I believe this is a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment well wor@@ th re@@ ad@@ ing .
in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the monitoring of ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity levels , I ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to say that P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and S@@ pa@@ in have already su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted what are to all in@@ t@@ ents and pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses their fin@@ al m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ments .
ladies and gentlemen , this is what the European Union is doing , w@@ an@@ ts to go on doing and will continue to do , in that s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of transparency and good cooperation the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office mentioned e@@ ar@@ li@@ er .
so much then , for information .
I do not however believe that it would be right , at a for@@ ma@@ l s@@ it@@ ting like today &apos; s , simply to pa@@ s@@ s on the su@@ m to@@ ta@@ l of information currently available without pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing it in the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al context we find ourselves in .
as I st@@ and before this House , which re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the people of Europe , I am b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to say that we need to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er our st@@ ar@@ ting point and the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l cause under@@ l@@ ying today &apos; s debate .
we must not sh@@ y a@@ way from it .
the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l cause under@@ l@@ ying this debate is that there was a problem in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to respect human rights in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a , which this very House con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed time and again .
Madam President , I cannot for@@ get how , when s@@ er@@ v@@ ing as F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister for my country in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 , I used to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s and con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ed at in this House very c@@ a@@ re@@ fully . through them , F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of Union countries were being ur@@ g@@ ed to take action and not to allow such v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent dis@@ regard for human rights in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a to pre@@ va@@ i@@ l .
( ap@@ pla@@ use and pro@@ te@@ st@@ s )
I have an even c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r rec@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tion of when I st@@ o@@ o@@ d before you in this very House in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , as President of the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of the European Union , and you p@@ le@@ ad@@ ed pa@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ a@@ te@@ ly with me , c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for action to pre@@ v@@ ent a dis@@ a@@ st@@ er .
we did take action , s@@ pu@@ r@@ red on of course by the good in@@ t@@ en@@ tions of all d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c countries who wish to de@@ f@@ end the rights being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated in others .
that is what we t@@ ri@@ ed to do .
and I should like to re@@ mind you .@@ .@@ .
( pro@@ te@@ st@@ s and ap@@ pla@@ use ) with all due respect and in a s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ sh@@ i@@ p , that the House la@@ ter adopted important res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions on the situation in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
we must not for@@ get our st@@ ar@@ ting point .
I believe we have to find time in this g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al debate not only for the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses which are the subject of current re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch we are de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y through to the end because we re@@ p@@ res@@ ent d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es , but also for the under@@ l@@ ying cause of the whole problem . that is n@@ one other than the serious v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of human rights in the Balkans , part of Europe , our own con@@ t@@ in@@ ent .
as I con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , I would like to take you back to the last em@@ o@@ tive moment we s@@ ha@@ red together .
you will rec@@ all that on 5 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er , in this very House , se@@ ated in this very se@@ at , I was p@@ ri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ged to share a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly em@@ o@@ tive moment with you all : the time when the Parliament in B@@ el@@ gra@@ de be@@ g@@ an to f@@ all to the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts .
let us not for@@ get what we have ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
let us not for@@ get the positive de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments le@@ ad@@ ing up to the Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b su@@ m@@ m@@ it . that was the first time that the fi@@ f@@ te@@ en governments of the European Union m@@ e@@ t with all the governments of the B@@ al@@ k@@ an countries , and that every one of them had been d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c@@ ally el@@ ec@@ ted .
finally , ladies and gentlemen , I want to say with some fe@@ el@@ ing that in recent years I have , as you can i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine , been in@@ t@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y involved in t@@ r@@ ying to b@@ u@@ il@@ d a more d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c Europe , a Europe in which human rights are res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted . I shall do e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing in my power to ensure respect for the qu@@ al@@ ities I mentioned e@@ ar@@ li@@ er : the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c approach , the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of transparency , com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity s@@ p@@ ir@@ it , since that is what we are .
I shall also do my best to ensure that the f@@ ac@@ ts we have available at any given time are for@@ w@@ ar@@ ded to the House .
as I have said in all s@@ in@@ c@@ er@@ ity , no l@@ in@@ k has so far em@@ er@@ ged between the f@@ ac@@ ts and the consequences .
that is what the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es are sa@@ ying .
I also want to state , however , that we cannot and must not be sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with this . let me re@@ it@@ er@@ ate that the Council and I are fully com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing the in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation of this matter through to the end .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I have ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we shall all be t@@ r@@ u@@ e to those gu@@ i@@ d@@ ing pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es I re@@ f@@ er@@ red to : responsibility , transparency and h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y .
thank you for your attention .

before g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m , to speak on behalf of the Commission , I have received a request for a pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l motion from Mr A@@ la@@ v@@ an@@ o@@ s .
in view of the fact that we cannot possible re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ise our debate on the basis of pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l mo@@ tions , I would ask you to p@@ le@@ a@@ se te@@ l@@ l me im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly , Mr A@@ la@@ v@@ an@@ o@@ s , in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the terms of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e , to which R@@ u@@ le your pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l motion re@@ f@@ ers .
( the President g@@ a@@ ve Mr A@@ la@@ v@@ an@@ o@@ s the f@@ l@@ o@@ or after he had c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied that his point re@@ la@@ ted to R@@ u@@ le 3@@ 7 )
Madam President , under R@@ u@@ le 3@@ 7 of our R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e , the Council and the Commission may ask to make a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment to the European Parliament ; however it is up to the President of the European Parliament , it is s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally up to you to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise the debate .
especially as Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a has th@@ ro@@ w@@ n part of the b@@ la@@ me on to the European Parliament .
you must give a re@@ p@@ ly here .
he has said that we , too , are par@@ tly responsible for the min@@ i n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r war because we called for action in the Balkans .
I would re@@ mind you that we agreed on the organisation of this debate at the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents last w@@ e@@ e@@ k .
I shall give the f@@ l@@ o@@ or st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t a@@ way to Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m , to speak on behalf of the Commission .
Madam President , before I t@@ u@@ r@@ n to the specific question of depleted uranium , let me first put the issue in context by sa@@ ying a wor@@ d about the environmental situation in the Balkans and what the European Commission has been doing to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le it .
n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly a dec@@ ad@@ e of regional con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts , com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with w@@ e@@ a@@ k institutions , ol@@ d @-@ f@@ a@@ sh@@ i@@ on@@ ed p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ting industry and a le@@ g@@ ac@@ y of years of un@@ ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , have le@@ f@@ t the environment of the B@@ al@@ k@@ an region in a state of serious n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ t .
in J@@ un@@ e 1999 , a report con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted for the Commission by the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment C@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e in B@@ u@@ d@@ ap@@ est g@@ a@@ ve a pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the environmental effects of the conflict in the B@@ al@@ k@@ an region .
in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 1999 , the United N@@ ations Balkans T@@ ask F@@ or@@ ce then pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed its as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge ar@@ is@@ ing as a result of the K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o conflict .
in our efforts to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the health and environmental situation in the Balkans , the Commission has e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed a t@@ w@@ in @-@ tra@@ c@@ k approach .
this com@@ b@@ in@@ es action on the one hand to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate problems with longer term assistance .
our longer @-@ term assistance is de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to em@@ b@@ ed a process of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able environmental protection in the countries in the region , all of which are p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate members of the Union .
let me set out b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly what we have been doing .
in the framework of the S@@ ta@@ bility P@@ ac@@ t , the Commission has been the d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force in the development of the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l R@@ ec@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me .
this pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a framework in which environmental actions can be pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed at regional level in the Balkans .
by b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing together the various b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l d@@ on@@ or@@ s and the countries in the region , we are pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing a f@@ o@@ c@@ us for the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise dis@@ par@@ ate and over@@ la@@ p@@ p@@ ing b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l actions .
to help la@@ un@@ ch the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l R@@ ec@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me the Commission is currently funding actions to the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of EUR 5@@ m .
other d@@ on@@ or@@ s have com@@ m@@ it@@ ted a further EUR 2@@ .@@ 5@@ m , and others still have ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed their in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to com@@ m@@ it ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d another EUR 5@@ .@@ 8@@ m , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing a to@@ ta@@ l of ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d EUR 1@@ 3@@ .@@ 3@@ m .
through these actions we have ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion b@@ u@@ il@@ ding , participation in the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the European E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment A@@ g@@ ency in the region and two environmental h@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s in A@@ l@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ a and the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v R@@ e@@ public of M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ i@@ a .
our contribution re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts the b@@ al@@ ance between se@@ t@@ t@@ ing the basis for long @-@ term environmental protection and ur@@ g@@ ent re@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ al action .
let me now come to the specific issue of depleted uranium and the public concern about the possible health r@@ is@@ ks as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with the use of depleted uranium weapons in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o and B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a for the local p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions , as well as the international per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l s@@ er@@ v@@ ing , or who have s@@ er@@ v@@ ed , in the region .
the Commission is n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally also concerned to ensure that the interests of its own st@@ a@@ f@@ f and con@@ tra@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s pla@@ c@@ ed in the region are pro@@ per@@ ly as@@ se@@ s@@ sed .
let me st@@ res@@ s again that this is an issue which has ar@@ ou@@ sed con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able public an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y and that an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y must be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed .
but it can only be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed on the basis of f@@ ac@@ ts and the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of all the information on this issue .
our w@@ at@@ ch@@ wor@@ d must be &quot; op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s . &quot;
that is why it is essential to pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ally and on the basis of s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
what then are the f@@ ac@@ ts ?
uranium itself , as you know , is a ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive and to@@ x@@ ic el@@ ement that o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ s in se@@ ver@@ al min@@ er@@ als .
depleted uranium is less ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive than natural uranium .
it is re@@ ad@@ il@@ y available as a by @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t of the n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r f@@ u@@ e@@ l c@@ y@@ c@@ le and it is very h@@ ar@@ d and s@@ el@@ f @-@ sh@@ ar@@ pen@@ ing .
as such , it is used to make ti@@ p@@ s to sh@@ el@@ l@@ s to increase their pen@@ et@@ ra@@ ting c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity .
however , there is currently no un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly held s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c opinion on the health and environmental effects of depleted uranium .
at the time that the UN Balkans T@@ ask F@@ or@@ ce pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed its or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge ar@@ is@@ ing as a result of the K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o conflict , it had not received any o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing whether or not depleted uranium had been used during the conflict .
when that con@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion was given , U@@ N@@ E@@ P carried out a mis@@ sion to c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t , for example , s@@ o@@ i@@ l , w@@ a@@ ter and v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ tion sa@@ m@@ pl@@ es in a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n last year .
we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t that the results of their ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ations will be k@@ no@@ w@@ n in M@@ ar@@ ch this year .
for our part , the Commission has ac@@ ted s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ tly in the f@@ ac@@ e of recent concerns to ensure that any Commission action on depleted uranium is based on s@@ ou@@ n@@ d s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
we have used ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res to con@@ v@@ en@@ e a meeting of an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent group of ex@@ per@@ ts under the E@@ u@@ ra@@ to@@ m Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences in general of ex@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e to depleted uranium .
in their opinion the ex@@ per@@ ts will be ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to draw upon all available s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t to have the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c opinion of the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ex@@ per@@ ts within a m@@ on@@ th from now .
in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the opinion the Commission will re@@ view whether or not follow @-@ up actions are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated , for our own st@@ a@@ f@@ f for example .
we will also dec@@ i@@ d@@ e whether it is appropriate to ad@@ ap@@ t ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing assistance programmes within the longer term with the a@@ i@@ m of en@@ sur@@ ing the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development of the region .
the Commission will , of course , in@@ v@@ ite Member States and international authorities to share information on their fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s and ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es and to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s any proposed follow @-@ up actions re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from the opinion pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c ex@@ per@@ ts .
the t@@ w@@ in @-@ tra@@ c@@ k approach I have set out under@@ l@@ in@@ es the v@@ al@@ u@@ e ad@@ ded of the Community contribution to ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the health and environmental situation in the B@@ al@@ k@@ an region .
the Commission con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ s its commitment to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing our m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m and long @-@ term support to improve the environmental and human health situation in the B@@ al@@ k@@ an region .
Madam President , the population is concerned , because there are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations of a l@@ in@@ k between this depleted uranium in m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ons and effects on people &apos;s health and on the environment .
at the same time , however , we are aware that there is no pro@@ of yet of the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence of such a l@@ in@@ k .
not a s@@ in@@ g@@ le s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c st@@ u@@ d@@ y , not one of the st@@ u@@ di@@ es that have been con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted in S@@ pa@@ in , I@@ t@@ al@@ y or other countries , has come up with e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
for this reason , following on from the re@@ mar@@ ks made here by the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the EU , D@@ r S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , I should like to say that this discussion does not in any way a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to a re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation of S@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ od@@ an M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c .
the mis@@ si@@ ons un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o by the t@@ ro@@ op@@ s of NATO and of EU Member States were mis@@ si@@ ons against a war c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al .
we o@@ we an un@@ d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ed de@@ b@@ t of gra@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de to these people for having com@@ m@@ it@@ ted themselves in this way to the cause of human rights .
those who be@@ a@@ r political and military responsibility also d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve our ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ation .
let me state that here c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ic@@ ally on behalf of my group .
we he@@ a@@ r , however , that the de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed weapons set o@@ f@@ f ch@@ em@@ ical pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses on impact , pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses which result in the c@@ re@@ ation of uranium o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e , for example , and which may p@@ o@@ s@@ e problems .
over the past few d@@ a@@ y@@ s we have been he@@ ar@@ ing about ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ations con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted by the P@@ en@@ ta@@ g@@ on in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 2000 from which it em@@ er@@ ged that this a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es con@@ ta@@ in@@ s small a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts of p@@ l@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ u@@ m too .
this en@@ ta@@ il@@ s r@@ is@@ ks , and the t@@ ro@@ op@@ s must be in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ted to take particular c@@ are in areas where these m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ons have been de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed .
in view of these con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations , it is indeed necessary to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t te@@ st@@ s for safety &apos;s sa@@ k@@ e .
these te@@ st@@ s are not a si@@ g@@ n of w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ness but a si@@ g@@ n of the c@@ re@@ di@@ bility of d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es which in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate such matters and s@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ p nothing under the c@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ t .
we o@@ we that to the military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l and the st@@ a@@ f@@ f of non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l organisations who were involved , as well as to the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population of the region .
we must establish whether there are actually effects on human health and the environment , so that we can either s@@ ou@@ n@@ d the all @-@ clear or take such weapons out of c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tion for all time .
at the same time , it is also essential , during the per@@ i@@ o@@ d in which these weapons and their effects are being st@@ u@@ di@@ ed , that ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition be used which is e@@ qu@@ ally e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent without having any of the fe@@ a@@ re@@ d effects .
may I ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my th@@ an@@ ks to D@@ r S@@ ol@@ an@@ a and the Commission for their w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to k@@ e@@ e@@ p the European Parliament in@@ for@@ m@@ ed , so that we can make our fin@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment in due course on the basis of their information and th@@ us guarantee the safety of our citizens and our t@@ ro@@ op@@ s as well as en@@ sur@@ ing the c@@ re@@ di@@ bility of any military op@@ er@@ ations we may have to under@@ take in future in de@@ f@@ ence of human rights .
Madam President , I would like to start by th@@ an@@ king the Commission , the Council and the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive for ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing to take part in a debate on this subject and to re@@ as@@ sure the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive that we are not going to re@@ open here a b@@ ac@@ k@@ d@@ ated debate on the mo@@ ti@@ v@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d the op@@ er@@ ations in the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a ; it would not be right , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se because the context has ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed ra@@ d@@ ic@@ ally .
today we have a re@@ as@@ on@@ able hope of including these countries in the European Union ; y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day we were in the th@@ ic@@ k of the n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ m@@ are of e@@ th@@ n@@ i@@ c c@@ le@@ an@@ s@@ ing and at@@ ro@@ c@@ ities en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged by the n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c d@@ ic@@ ta@@ t@@ or@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s of I@@ z@@ et@@ be@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ c , K@@ ar@@ ad@@ z@@ ic and M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c .
it is appropriate for the European Parliament to be the for@@ u@@ m for a responsible , trans@@ par@@ ent debate on the issue of the possible re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p between the use of depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s and a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al number of de@@ a@@ th@@ s and cases of il@@ l health a@@ m@@ on@@ g the s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers of different countries who have par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ ted in op@@ er@@ ations , in@@ it@@ i@@ ally in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and more rec@@ ently in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , and on the concern regarding the di@@ rec@@ t and in@@ di@@ rec@@ t impact on the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans involved .
there would be no cause for al@@ ar@@ m if there were no more than the su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion that the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency of these cases ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed the a@@ ver@@ age for the same age c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies , and it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y for this reason that we must establish the ex@@ ac@@ t c@@ a@@ u@@ ses .
to this end , various initiatives have already been un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en at national and international level .
we call upon NATO itself to support these initiatives , making use of the contribution of the U@@ S ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion where necessary . in order to ob@@ ta@@ in all possible re@@ as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce from the world of s@@ c@@ i@@ ence , we call upon the Council and the Commission to take an ac@@ tive part in this co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation op@@ er@@ ation and ex@@ change of information and we ur@@ ge the Commission to set in motion its own a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ous s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , the m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m and the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle : this is not a question of as@@ s@@ er@@ ting a principle , the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle , which was e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in the context of food safety , and trans@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing it w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ s@@ al@@ e to f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy .
rather , it is a matter of re@@ al@@ is@@ ing that the military problem has become a c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an problem and concerns the protection , for a long time after the op@@ er@@ ation itself , of the health and li@@ v@@ es of c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans as well as s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
Madam President , the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party w@@ an@@ ts to see un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y and con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
young men and women must be able to report for peace @-@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing and peace @-@ making s@@ er@@ v@@ ice in the con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce that e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing is being done in the interests of their safety .
every r@@ is@@ k must be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ated , every s@@ ol@@ di@@ er who is concerned must be able to ob@@ ta@@ in a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation free of ch@@ ar@@ ge , and c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans who may have been ex@@ p@@ o@@ sed to d@@ an@@ g@@ er must rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve every attention and , if necessary , be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed , par@@ tly so that we can le@@ ar@@ n from ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence .
it was , of course , out of regard for c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans that we in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ed in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o and B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a , and we did so on s@@ ou@@ n@@ d m@@ or@@ al g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds .
the ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ations must be th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h , they must be carried out by in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ex@@ per@@ ts and there must be transparency about m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s and possible f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s of un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y .
if there are any reasons at all for concern , al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es to depleted uranium must be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed in and , until c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y has been ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ed at , its use may have to be su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded .
I should like to thank Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a for pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing that all information will be pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
we shall h@@ ol@@ d h@@ i@@ m to this , and he will also be held to account if the pr@@ om@@ ise is not k@@ e@@ p@@ t .
I should also like to thank Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a for p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out our common responsibility for the military and h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an action , which is the reason why we are s@@ it@@ ting here .
it did in fact pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce results and pa@@ v@@ ed the way for democracy in the Balkans .
it was a m@@ or@@ al d@@ u@@ ty to take that action , and we can be pr@@ ou@@ d that we com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with that d@@ u@@ ty .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that this debate is taking place at last .
we t@@ ri@@ ed - un@@ su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully - to have this debate during the last par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y term in A@@ p@@ ri@@ l 1999 , when the NATO b@@ om@@ b@@ ing was st@@ ar@@ ting .
a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s after that , on 5 M@@ a@@ y to be ex@@ ac@@ t , because we were con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of w@@ e@@ ap@@ on was being used , I together with 1@@ 1 f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members s@@ ent a le@@ t@@ ter to Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , the then NATO S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y G@@ en@@ er@@ al , to request that a st@@ o@@ p be put to the use of such weapons which were l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to cause health problems at a la@@ ter d@@ ate for the local population and the military for@@ c@@ es involved , not to m@@ en@@ tion ir@@ re@@ ver@@ si@@ ble con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation of the environment .
we did not rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve any an@@ s@@ w@@ er at that time .
I think that is wor@@ th p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out .
NATO d@@ ri@@ p @-@ f@@ ed us with a s@@ er@@ ies of information b@@ ul@@ le@@ t@@ in@@ s . in support of this , I would re@@ f@@ er you to the com@@ ment made by the United N@@ ations E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment group , at the end of 1999 , that it did not have su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent d@@ at@@ a to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the state of depleted uranium con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation on the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
what Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a has just t@@ ol@@ d us , a few m@@ om@@ ents ago , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that the action taken would be com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly trans@@ par@@ ent , is no@@ v@@ e@@ l and it is good n@@ e@@ ws , but I feel rather d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ful regarding this commitment to transparency con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing the att@@ it@@ u@@ de adopted by NATO over the last year .
I feel even more d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ful when I he@@ a@@ r the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments of the current NATO re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es .
there are a number of points which I should like to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy . I think this is necessary .
when we are t@@ ol@@ d that a l@@ in@@ k must be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed between the state of health of the military for@@ c@@ es and the p@@ res@@ ence , or ab@@ s@@ ence , of depleted uranium , we have to be c@@ a@@ re@@ ful , as this is no si@@ m@@ p@@ le matter , and there are se@@ ver@@ al par@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ ters which must be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation in order to ex@@ pla@@ in the p@@ o@@ or state of health of a number of members of the military : ch@@ em@@ ical p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , a whole r@@ an@@ ge of aspects of environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge , li@@ v@@ ing conditions .
it is k@@ no@@ w@@ n , mo@@ re@@ over , that the effects of ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation do not become ap@@ par@@ ent until after a re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y long per@@ i@@ o@@ d of time .
it would not , therefore , be pro@@ per to say at this stage , as some s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s have done , rather th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly in my opinion , that there is no con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion .
it is too e@@ ar@@ ly to say .
perhaps it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e for some military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l , but I would be a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ed if it were possible to g@@ en@@ er@@ al@@ ise .
my second point is that depleted uranium is not a n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing su@@ b@@ st@@ ance , as people would have us believe , or a less ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive one .
it is ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 20 % less ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive than natural uranium .
it is a by @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing and must acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly be t@@ re@@ ated as w@@ a@@ st@@ e .
I would point out that we have a European directive adopted in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 , which should have been trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed by the Member States , st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ting that , where the ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity of such w@@ a@@ st@@ e ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ s a con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion of 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 B@@ ec@@ qu@@ e@@ re@@ l@@ s per k@@ il@@ o , its ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation must be pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted from s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing .
in this in@@ st@@ ance we are t@@ al@@ king about a con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion that is 4@@ ,@@ 000 time greater .
it is therefore quite ab@@ sur@@ d to use ar@@ m@@ s of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e to s@@ pre@@ a@@ d it in the environment , c@@ re@@ ating in@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ ble par@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es which c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ t in the res@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ y and di@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ve system and then to c@@ la@@ i@@ m that the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence of a problem re@@ ma@@ in@@ s to be pro@@ v@@ en .
either there is a problem here , of n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ity , or I have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to understand this European directive .
why should the conditions ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to the people of Europe not be ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to the people of K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o or B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a or to military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l ?
I should like to end with one last com@@ ment . p@@ le@@ a@@ se ex@@ c@@ use me for going on a little too long .
Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , I must te@@ l@@ l you that the end does not j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the means .
( ap@@ pla@@ use ) .@@ T@@ here is no one in this House that su@@ p@@ por@@ ted the M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
yet it is not Mr M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c and his al@@ l@@ ies who are the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of the ra@@ di@@ ation , who have in@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed depleted uranium , but the local population , the military for@@ c@@ es and the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of N@@ G@@ O@@ s .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , a m@@ on@@ th ago , in ad@@ op@@ ting the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights , the F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to set themselves out as a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity of v@@ al@@ u@@ es .
the c@@ re@@ di@@ bility of such an a@@ m@@ b@@ ition is not w@@ on by te@@ x@@ ts al@@ one , but by our real @-@ life res@@ p@@ on@@ ses to si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant e@@ v@@ ents , by means of st@@ r@@ on@@ g political actions under@@ p@@ in@@ n@@ ed by e@@ th@@ ical pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , even though this action , quite p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly , costs a great deal to those taking it .
t@@ r@@ u@@ e m@@ er@@ it is rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised when one &apos; s back is against the w@@ all .
the B@@ al@@ k@@ an s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e , t@@ en years after the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r , is one such si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant e@@ v@@ ent .
it b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s the F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en f@@ ac@@ e @-@ to @-@ f@@ ac@@ e with their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in a s@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ r f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion .
in my opinion and that of my group , acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting these res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities means taking b@@ ol@@ d decisions in at least three res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts .
there is , firstly , the human as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the problem .
people have di@@ ed , more are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing , and still more are now li@@ v@@ ing in an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y and in fe@@ a@@ r of the future .
these people in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l and many c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans .
the b@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ ous th@@ ing about some t@@ y@@ p@@ es of weapons is that they continue to cause c@@ a@@ su@@ al@@ ti@@ es , in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ a@@ te@@ ly , after the war .
we are clearly f@@ ac@@ ed with a situation of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e in the Balkans .
in the past , the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity has done itself c@@ re@@ d@@ it by pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ it@@ ing an@@ t@@ i @-@ per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l min@@ es on these g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds .
it should now , by the same to@@ k@@ en , b@@ an weapons con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing depleted uranium .
it is up to the European countries which man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture them , including G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and , unfortunately , my own country , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , to agree to put an end to the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture , st@@ or@@ age and , of course , the use , even ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ ally , of such ar@@ m@@ s .
this would be doing no more than to com@@ p@@ ly with the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ its weapons with in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate effects .
at the same time , all v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s must be g@@ r@@ an@@ ted the right to health c@@ are , all p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s must be g@@ r@@ an@@ ted the right to sc@@ an@@ n@@ ing , and all the regions concerned must be g@@ r@@ an@@ ted the right to dec@@ on@@ ta@@ min@@ ation and re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation .
is d@@ u@@ c@@ king one &apos; s res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities by c@@ la@@ im@@ ing today that the d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous nature of these ar@@ m@@ s had not been i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied at the time , even though a great many government in@@ qu@@ i@@ ri@@ es and internal reports clearly d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted as much , really a serious and f@@ it@@ t@@ ing att@@ it@@ u@@ de ?
I s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly feel that this is a re@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ d action , out of st@@ e@@ p in terms of the information now available to our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w citizens .
this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to my second point , the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge which this tra@@ g@@ i@@ c case p@@ o@@ ses for us , for there is a long l@@ it@@ any of c@@ ul@@ pa@@ ble si@@ l@@ ence , c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter @-@ t@@ r@@ u@@ th@@ s and l@@ ying by om@@ is@@ sion in which both NATO and some Member States have in@@ d@@ ul@@ ged as much as possible .
having agreed in the past to ac@@ t as a s@@ or@@ t of in@@ ter@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ary between these parties , Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , you cannot now be sur@@ pr@@ ised to find that we are as@@ king you to give us some ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations regarding the serious matters which are gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally em@@ er@@ g@@ ing .
there is , as you have said , an un@@ d@@ en@@ i@@ able d@@ em@@ and for t@@ r@@ u@@ th regarding past matters and transparency regarding future matters , but , in all h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y , in this respect I do not think that either the F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en or NATO can p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly think they have pa@@ i@@ d their d@@ u@@ es after what you have just t@@ ol@@ d us , Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a .
( ap@@ pla@@ use ) I@@ n the end , we must take this difficult or@@ deal as an opportunity to re@@ as@@ se@@ s@@ s our con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of the organisation of European security and relations between the European Union and NATO .
in our opinion it is high time that we c@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ d to allow ourselves , both on the European con@@ t@@ in@@ ent and in the re@@ st of the world , to be d@@ ra@@ g@@ g@@ ed into the tra@@ g@@ i@@ c de@@ ad@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ks of A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c op@@ tions .
I am th@@ in@@ king of the h@@ or@@ ri@@ fi@@ c effects of the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r on the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i people , particularly the children .
I am th@@ in@@ king of the s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the economic p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al and the ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical heritage not only of Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a but also of its n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing countries - take the D@@ an@@ u@@ be , for example - com@@ p@@ ou@@ n@@ ded , as we have just seen , by con@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion of the w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d use in this conflict of ar@@ m@@ s and m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ons which , in addition to c@@ a@@ using c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ less in@@ no@@ c@@ ent c@@ a@@ su@@ al@@ ti@@ es in the sh@@ or@@ t term also re@@ p@@ res@@ ent a long @-@ term th@@ re@@ at for people com@@ ing into con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the areas which have been b@@ om@@ b@@ ed .
this , Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , has nothing to do with de@@ f@@ en@@ ding human rights . no , as far as Europe is concerned , the end must not j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the means .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that , one way or another , these are qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons which many people now have in mind .
today is one stage in the process , and it will be f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed by other st@@ ag@@ es .
I hope that in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of us will al@@ i@@ g@@ n ourselves with this mo@@ ve for change .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 0 , when I was 20 years ol@@ d , a c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ded throughout the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e world : in Europe , in our uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities , in sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s - they at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ted without su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s as yet to pen@@ et@@ ra@@ te the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es - and it was the c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n against R@@ i@@ d@@ g@@ way , the &quot; P@@ la@@ gu@@ e G@@ en@@ er@@ al . &quot;
C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s , s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s - for then you had the S@@ t@@ al@@ in P@@ e@@ ac@@ e A@@ w@@ ar@@ ds at various c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al m@@ om@@ ents , between 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 0 and 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 3 - a few t@@ re@@ m@@ b@@ ling pa@@ p@@ is@@ t@@ s here and there , would you mind con@@ c@@ ed@@ ing us a moment of res@@ p@@ it@@ e from your re@@ t@@ ro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive m@@ or@@ al@@ is@@ ing , from your con@@ st@@ ant qu@@ est to ap@@ por@@ tion b@@ la@@ me ?
you con@@ c@@ ed@@ ed very little .
of course the D@@ res@@ d@@ en b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s in the G@@ re@@ at W@@ a@@ r may not have been necessary and may have been c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al , but the t@@ r@@ u@@ th is that you do not g@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ s over this : you com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t@@ s will not le@@ a@@ ve us al@@ one with your pa@@ c@@ i@@ f@@ is@@ t line @-@ up .
well then , a European Parliament which is now f@@ ac@@ ed with a motion c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for such res@@ p@@ it@@ e is co@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ ly , rec@@ k@@ less , an@@ ti@@ d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c and ir@@ responsible : an@@ ti@@ d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c in any case because it is dis@@ regarding the com@@ m@@ it@@ ments called for by par@@ li@@ a@@ ments and governments in ti@@ m@@ es of need .
we cannot w@@ a@@ it to find out the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c t@@ r@@ u@@ th about these weapons , but if they had been used to pre@@ v@@ ent V@@ u@@ k@@ o@@ va@@ r being raised to the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d as it was , we would have s@@ pa@@ red the li@@ v@@ es of t@@ en@@ s , h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ ans , K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ ar@@ s , S@@ er@@ b@@ s and others in C@@ ro@@ a@@ ti@@ a .
I therefore thank you , Madam President , and I a@@ w@@ a@@ it the re@@ v@@ el@@ ation of the t@@ r@@ u@@ th which must be as@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in the f@@ ac@@ e of our t@@ en@@ d@@ ency to d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ t and ab@@ use it .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Madam President , we need to establish the f@@ ac@@ ts in this case .
we have received certain as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es from Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a but we know , and our I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in particular will re@@ mind us of this , that it will be difficult for those w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e s@@ ons have di@@ ed of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a to accept that as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce un@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ed@@ ly .
these d@@ a@@ y@@ s we cannot e@@ a@@ si@@ ly accept death when better health and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity se@@ e@@ m to have b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t us so n@@ e@@ a@@ r to im@@ m@@ or@@ t@@ al@@ ity .
we now need to re@@ in@@ for@@ ce Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a &apos;s as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce with re@@ p@@ e@@ ated te@@ st@@ ing o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red as w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y as possible and with the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s from the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an authorities .
I have been as@@ k@@ ed , particularly by my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e L@@ or@@ d In@@ g@@ le@@ w@@ o@@ o@@ d , who re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the area of C@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ri@@ a where te@@ st @-@ f@@ ir@@ ing of these weapons has taken place , to in@@ s@@ is@@ t that the question as to the possible effect upon the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population should be taken into account when this te@@ st@@ ing is carried out .
if he is going to re@@ p@@ ly to this debate , Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a might like to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s that point .
there were a large number of B@@ r@@ it@@ ish s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers in the B@@ al@@ k@@ an W@@ a@@ r and , of course in the G@@ ul@@ f , and as a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive I will say this : of course , we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium , but against the b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d of Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a &apos;s st@@ a@@ te@@ ment , we do not believe that NATO should adopt a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of such weapons .
we have to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ ar@@ s against ter@@ ri@@ ble people .
such a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m could place our for@@ c@@ es at a p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge and th@@ e@@ re@@ by p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ ally en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ er more li@@ v@@ es than the NATO for@@ c@@ es .
as Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m has said : the real and im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate d@@ an@@ g@@ er in the Balkans comes from general environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation following years of n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ t , cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion and war .
this is what the European Union needs to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s while we m@@ on@@ it@@ or very c@@ a@@ re@@ fully the results of m@@ ed@@ ical te@@ st@@ ing .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion let me say that Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z &apos;s contribution was very re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ing of the con@@ st@@ ant agenda of the le@@ f@@ t which a@@ im@@ s to se@@ par@@ ate the European Union from the United States and would result in de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ing Europe of any real in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence in the world .
( ap@@ pla@@ use from the right )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a quite re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ ble as well as a c@@ y@@ n@@ ical debate that we are h@@ ol@@ ding here .
I am al@@ most in@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ed to res@@ is@@ t any in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in a discussion about which t@@ y@@ p@@ e of le@@ th@@ al a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition is the better .
and yet that is what we are doing today .
I have n@@ e@@ v@@ er taken any part in de@@ b@@ a@@ tes about which w@@ ar@@ s are ex@@ p@@ ed@@ i@@ ent and which are un@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ able either .
that is not our subject today .
we have a different subject to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s .
in the past , we have re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly said that , if it is necessary to use ar@@ m@@ ed force - and we have always agreed on this - we must ensure that our in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion has no more impact than is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly essential and that it does the least possible d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to the environment and to the health of those who sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve it .
this , of course , is why we have con@@ st@@ an@@ tly con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed and d@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed ch@@ em@@ ical weapons , for example , and have always agreed that these weapons must n@@ e@@ v@@ er be used , because the ha@@ v@@ o@@ c they w@@ re@@ a@@ k on the environment and on human health is out of all pro@@ por@@ tion to their military e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
if we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing today whether m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ons con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing uranium do or do not cause le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a , then I have no de@@ si@@ r@@ e to he@@ a@@ r an@@ y@@ one te@@ l@@ l us , not even D@@ r S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I g@@ re@@ at@@ ly respect , whether or not there is defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve pro@@ of .
we are not t@@ al@@ king about defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve pro@@ of , and when we s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e in this House about our own health and about B@@ S@@ E , we certainly all agreed that the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle had to be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed , even though we were n@@ e@@ v@@ er able to pro@@ ve that in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es are the cause of new @-@ v@@ ar@@ i@@ ant C@@ re@@ u@@ t@@ z@@ f@@ el@@ d @-@ J@@ ac@@ o@@ b dis@@ e@@ a@@ se .
we rec@@ ently dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle and put it to the vote , and we said that we must b@@ an particular su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es or procedures if there are j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ able concerns about them , even if there is no defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve pro@@ of .
we know today that there are n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous cases of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a .
and as long as the s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s are still ar@@ gu@@ ing , as long as all of us do not know which of the s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s is cor@@ rec@@ t , we must agree that this a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition cannot be used until every last as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the issue has been res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed .
su@@ re@@ ly nothing less than a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on this a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition would be an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble decision for us to take today .
but in addition to this we must also c@@ are for the people who li@@ ve in the regions , for their health and the health of their children .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
Mr President , I sa@@ w a sh@@ or@@ t f@@ il@@ m on G@@ er@@ m@@ an te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing which was pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed on behalf of the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an ar@@ my before the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r .
it l@@ it@@ er@@ ally said that d@@ u@@ st which is re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d through the com@@ b@@ u@@ st@@ ion of depleted uranium con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a d@@ an@@ g@@ er if it en@@ ds up in@@ si@@ d@@ e the b@@ od@@ y .
so the r@@ is@@ ks involved were k@@ no@@ w@@ n p@@ ri@@ or to the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r .
were the al@@ l@@ ies aware of this before the B@@ al@@ k@@ an W@@ a@@ r and before the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which , I ha@@ st@@ en to ad@@ d , I do not dis@@ pu@@ te ?
did the governments and the military know ?
if so , why were s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers not given w@@ ar@@ n@@ in@@ g@@ s in a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r way ?
why are you now sa@@ ying today that the al@@ l@@ i@@ ance did not have any pro@@ of of r@@ is@@ k ?
people b@@ ec@@ a@@ me il@@ l having been to the Balkans , just as they did after the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r .
no@@ b@@ od@@ y k@@ no@@ ws how many more will f@@ all il@@ l in those regions .
who will provide them with a con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing an@@ s@@ w@@ er t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w ?
the b@@ an on the use of depleted uranium will be the only m@@ e@@ a@@ sure which can re@@ st@@ or@@ e con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence .
Mr President , the e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence com@@ ing from B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a in particular points clearly to a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve increase in cases of c@@ an@@ c@@ er where b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s to@@ o@@ k place during the Balkans war and where a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of depleted uranium were used .
it is now b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed that the depleted uranium r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds were used by the b@@ om@@ b@@ ers which carried out at@@ ta@@ c@@ ks on the su@@ b@@ ur@@ b@@ s of S@@ ar@@ a@@ j@@ e@@ v@@ o and el@@ se@@ where during the Balkans war .
the people of the Balkans are ent@@ it@@ led to full and u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ al an@@ s@@ w@@ ers with regard to the c@@ ar@@ c@@ en@@ o@@ g@@ en@@ ic effects of the depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s which were used during the war .
this Parliament and the European Union should , and must , be most v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ous in pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing full an@@ s@@ w@@ ers to these most important public health and human rights issues .
on a se@@ par@@ ate but re@@ la@@ ted matter , I was quite dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ed to re@@ a@@ d that depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s have been fi@@ red into the I@@ r@@ ish S@@ e@@ a by B@@ r@@ it@@ ish M@@ in@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ y of D@@ e@@ f@@ ence for@@ c@@ es at the S@@ ol@@ way F@@ ir@@ th between E@@ n@@ g@@ land and S@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ land and also at a r@@ an@@ ge on the C@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ri@@ an co@@ a@@ st , just se@@ v@@ en m@@ il@@ es from a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r pl@@ ant .
this depleted uranium has been used in C@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ri@@ a up to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , and it is b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed that as many as 1@@ 4@@ 00 depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s have been fi@@ red into the S@@ ol@@ way F@@ ir@@ th , which is an in@@ let of the I@@ r@@ ish S@@ e@@ a .
as a Member of the European Parliament , re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing L@@ e@@ in@@ st@@ er , which is al@@ on@@ g the I@@ r@@ ish S@@ e@@ a , I am de@@ e@@ p@@ ly concerned at these re@@ v@@ el@@ ations .
I am c@@ al@@ l@@ ing on the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish government to make a full st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on the matter .
I want to know whether there are any possible public health consequences from the use of depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s in the l@@ o@@ c@@ ation to which I have re@@ f@@ er@@ red to today .
it is up to the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish government to make a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on these matters .
Mr President , the s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al of the depleted uranium mis@@ si@@ l@@ es is just the la@@ te@@ st c@@ ha@@ p@@ ter in the d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ able war you have w@@ ag@@ ed against S@@ er@@ b@@ i@@ a .
Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , you are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing transparency now that the s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al has em@@ er@@ ged but you are two years too late .
do you take us for f@@ o@@ ol@@ s ?
do you really think the United States will let you get a@@ way with this even though it has taken for@@ ty years to see the f@@ il@@ m@@ s , the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of the human ex@@ per@@ im@@ ents they carried out on their own for@@ c@@ es on the sh@@ i@@ p@@ s ir@@ ra@@ di@@ ated following the B@@ i@@ k@@ in@@ i n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r te@@ st@@ s ?
all we know , at any e@@ v@@ ent , is that you have pa@@ i@@ d little he@@ ed to the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle that people k@@ e@@ e@@ p h@@ ar@@ p@@ ing on about here .
all we know , as Commissioner W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m has just said , is that the s@@ m@@ il@@ ing f@@ ac@@ e of your s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ m@@ an , Mr S@@ h@@ ed , con@@ c@@ e@@ al@@ ed the use of these sh@@ el@@ l@@ s .
all we know is that the in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ence of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a a@@ m@@ on@@ g our s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers is ab@@ n@@ or@@ m@@ ally high .
if a c@@ a@@ u@@ sa@@ l l@@ in@@ k were to be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed , then you would be responsible for a war c@@ r@@ im@@ e , as the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments made re@@ f@@ er@@ red only to military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l , as if the uranium were c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ating between military and c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l .
quite f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly , ladies and gentlemen , if you want the t@@ r@@ u@@ th , then look for it y@@ ourselves , and do not ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , the European H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , to con@@ d@@ em@@ n Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , the for@@ m@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y G@@ en@@ er@@ al of NATO .
Mr President , today we are ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing an extremely important subject which re@@ qu@@ i@@ res great re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion over extremely long per@@ i@@ od@@ s of time , and , mo@@ re@@ over , we are doing so on the basis of a w@@ a@@ ve of em@@ o@@ tion which , se@@ e@@ ing as we are not s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , is il@@ l @-@ su@@ ited to the p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s we are ob@@ li@@ ged to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out here .
with regard to the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle , to which pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have re@@ f@@ er@@ red , I am s@@ om@@ e@@ what concerned because , although we are ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing the issue of B@@ S@@ E , I do not i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine an@@ y@@ one would ever con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late sa@@ ying that we should not e@@ at any t@@ y@@ p@@ e of m@@ e@@ at , even in the ab@@ s@@ ence of well @-@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c results .
as the Commissioner , with w@@ h@@ o@@ m I am in com@@ p@@ le@@ te agreement , said just now , we must first ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine what the environmental situation in the region was , but we must also as@@ certain , with great c@@ are of course , the re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p of cause and effect between the e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment used - the weapons - and the impact on health .
I must , mo@@ re@@ over , point out that depleted uranium is used in civil con@@ te@@ x@@ ts in many other se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , and we should certainly in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate these extremely th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly .
we must also be@@ a@@ r in mind the r@@ is@@ k of in@@ c@@ it@@ ing p@@ an@@ ic , where st@@ r@@ on@@ g p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons are adopted , a@@ m@@ on@@ g those who s@@ en@@ d st@@ a@@ f@@ f to the region and those who are s@@ ent there by the Member States .
it is my view that we should an@@ al@@ y@@ se this issue extremely c@@ a@@ re@@ fully and con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that we certainly all have good cause to be gra@@ te@@ ful to NATO for its past and future in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions .
we do not support the call for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are h@@ ol@@ ding this debate today because of the concern we have for people .
some of these people are the military per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l , our t@@ ro@@ op@@ s , who are there , but we are also concerned about the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population , the m@@ il@@ li@@ ons who li@@ ve in Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
we do not se@@ e@@ k to establish here and now whether the war in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o was j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied or not .
it would be in@@ appropriate to en@@ g@@ age in such a debate .
what we must do - and I en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly agree here with the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the C@@ F@@ S@@ P - is to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine with the u@@ t@@ most c@@ are and p@@ rec@@ is@@ i@@ on whether a l@@ in@@ k ex@@ is@@ t@@ s between the in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ences of il@@ l@@ ness and the qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities of a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition with depleted uranium which were fi@@ red during the war in Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o and in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a too .
if we in@@ t@@ end to do that , we must p@@ le@@ d@@ ge ourselves to certain important pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , so that we at least , as el@@ ec@@ ted re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of Europe , can re@@ st@@ or@@ e the c@@ re@@ di@@ bility which NATO has for@@ fe@@ ited through this and si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r e@@ p@@ is@@ od@@ es .
f@@ o@@ re@@ most priority at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es to p@@ rec@@ ise and in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent te@@ st@@ s by international ex@@ per@@ ts with the aid of every possible s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d .
secondly , we need a ra@@ d@@ ical change in our information policy , and in this respect I must thank the Council , and above all the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the C@@ F@@ S@@ P , for their un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king to make all information available to Parliament .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , and finally , we must d@@ em@@ and an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on all ar@@ m@@ s and a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e until we have the com@@ p@@ le@@ te results of the te@@ st@@ s we have com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed , so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
Mr President , to become em@@ b@@ ro@@ il@@ ed in a s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c debate , in which many see a l@@ in@@ k - and some do not - between the use of depleted uranium and an increase in the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities , is every p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an &apos; s n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ m@@ are .
there is the r@@ is@@ k that in this way , the political debate ti@@ p@@ s over into a s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c one .
I believe we should u@@ p@@ h@@ ol@@ d the ta@@ s@@ k of the p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an , which is t@@ w@@ o@@ f@@ ol@@ d , in my opinion .
first of all , the European Union &apos; s responsibility is towards the local population .
it is up to the Member States to as@@ su@@ me responsibility for their s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
in my view , it should be the EU &apos; s responsibility to look after the local population out there .
the second responsibility we have is not to be t@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ ed into f@@ o@@ c@@ using all st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on the use of depleted uranium .
there might well be other c@@ a@@ u@@ ses for the in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities .
I therefore believe that a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y should be in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ted into all the ab@@ n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ ities which o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r l@@ o@@ c@@ ally and in the national ar@@ m@@ i@@ es .
finally , something which ir@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ tes me no end is that Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , as well as a number of f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w M@@ E@@ P@@ s , establish a f@@ al@@ se l@@ in@@ k between the end and means to used to re@@ ac@@ h the end , or the l@@ in@@ k between the war and the means de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed .
I was in favour of in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ing in the war , but I am against taking ir@@ responsible r@@ is@@ ks .
Mr President , the to@@ x@@ ic nature of the D@@ U sh@@ el@@ l@@ s , and the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations th@@ e@@ re@@ of for the military and c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l that have been in con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the effects of these in I@@ ra@@ q , B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a @-@ H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , is a matter that we must approach c@@ a@@ re@@ fully and c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
we must be c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ous , as has been said , for , despite the re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en , it has not been possible to establish any clear cor@@ relation between the use of these ar@@ m@@ s and the cases of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a that c@@ a@@ me to li@@ g@@ h@@ t following these military op@@ er@@ ations , but also , you should be aware , during the long process of de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing and te@@ st@@ ing these weapons .
the v@@ e@@ i@@ l of un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y must , of course , be li@@ f@@ ted .
we can therefore only welcome the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y bo@@ di@@ es at every level within our States , the A@@ l@@ li@@ ance and the European Union .
however , the com@@ motion c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by the re@@ v@@ el@@ ations of recent w@@ e@@ e@@ ks must not pu@@ s@@ h us down the p@@ at@@ h of what I would call &quot; p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s &quot; at the very time , Mrs R@@ o@@ t@@ h @-@ B@@ er@@ en@@ d@@ t , when the European Union is de@@ v@@ o@@ ting itself to defin@@ ing the p@@ rec@@ ise l@@ im@@ its of the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle in order to pre@@ v@@ ent it being ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ tly .
today , the D@@ U sh@@ el@@ l@@ s st@@ o@@ re@@ d in our various countries are the ar@@ m@@ s best c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of pen@@ et@@ ra@@ ting t@@ an@@ ks , since technical de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in ar@@ m@@ our pla@@ ting have made the use of h@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es and t@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ st@@ en sh@@ el@@ l in@@ effective .
you should be aware that the development of new ar@@ m@@ s will take many years .
during this per@@ i@@ o@@ d can we sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ice our de@@ f@@ ence on the al@@ ta@@ r of un@@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded fe@@ ar@@ s ?
I do not think so . that is why I shall op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e the request for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m which has been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in point 6 of the com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise resolution when it is put to the vote before this House .
I would con@@ c@@ ed@@ e that the present debate does have one m@@ er@@ it : the fact that it d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes , if there were any need , that we must not d@@ re@@ am of a c@@ le@@ an war , something I have always con@@ si@@ de@@ red as not m@@ e@@ re@@ ly an il@@ l@@ u@@ sion but an ou@@ t@@ ri@@ g@@ h@@ t per@@ ver@@ sion .
war is always di@@ r@@ ty because its objective is to at@@ ta@@ c@@ k human life .
it can only be con@@ si@@ de@@ red as a l@@ e@@ s@@ se@@ r e@@ v@@ i@@ l when every other means of res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing or pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing at@@ ta@@ c@@ ks on human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and freedom have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed , and y@@ es , Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , that was the case in both I@@ ra@@ q and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
Mr President , we have a responsibility towards two parties : on the one hand , the young people who to@@ o@@ k part - com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ab@@ ly - in the military op@@ er@@ ations in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o and , of course , their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies , and , on the other , the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies of those peace @-@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons , the B@@ al@@ k@@ an p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es .
it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e , the di@@ rec@@ t or in@@ di@@ rec@@ t re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p between the use of depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s and the cases of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a , which are m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ pl@@ ying , has not yet been pro@@ v@@ ed in@@ dis@@ pu@@ ta@@ b@@ ly , although the l@@ in@@ k ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s more than l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y , but these cases ex@@ is@@ t and are so n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous as to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st concern .
it is therefore right to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e , with a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated approach , all the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations necessary to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the impact of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of ar@@ m on health and the environment , but , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , it is also right to apply the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle , which has n@@ e@@ v@@ er been so appropriate as on this o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion , and that is why it is ur@@ g@@ ent and v@@ it@@ al to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , d@@ a@@ il@@ y , and indeed al@@ most h@@ ou@@ r@@ ly , we rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve new information about p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al d@@ an@@ g@@ ers .
that is why it is very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that Parliament is de@@ al@@ ing with this issue today .
I thank the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive for pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing us com@@ p@@ le@@ te information and transparency .
for us too , it is a new ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing matters of security and de@@ f@@ ence policy in this way .
it will certainly b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it European security and de@@ f@@ ence policy to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the con@@ st@@ el@@ la@@ tion that pre@@ va@@ il@@ s in the Member States , where governments and op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly t@@ r@@ ying to sc@@ or@@ e political points on these issues .
in G@@ er@@ many , for example , the R@@ ed @-@ G@@ re@@ en co@@ al@@ ition Government under their Minister of D@@ e@@ f@@ ence has been t@@ ri@@ v@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ ing all these r@@ is@@ ks , which is something that has certainly not been ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing here in Parliament .
we in the European Parliament have an opportunity to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ al b@@ ri@@ e@@ fin@@ g@@ s and information , and that is a very good th@@ ing .
what is d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ ing - and it has been a fe@@ a@@ ture of this debate too - are b@@ el@@ ated rec@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ations about the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r and the war in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z , if you c@@ ite the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights and our high European pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es in this context , I must re@@ mind you that , at the time when f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l European pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es were at st@@ a@@ k@@ e , when e@@ th@@ n@@ i@@ c c@@ le@@ an@@ s@@ ing , ex@@ pu@@ l@@ si@@ ons and ter@@ ro@@ r were the order of the day in the Balkans , your political g@@ r@@ ou@@ p@@ ing st@@ o@@ o@@ d h@@ el@@ pl@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly on the si@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es .
this also has to be said in such a debate .
we are c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for re@@ le@@ v@@ ant information to be c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ ted , for the information available in the Member States to be co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated at the European level with UN d@@ at@@ a through the s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ ed ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es of the United N@@ ations and su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to Parliament again .
an ar@@ m@@ ed conflict must always be g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ed by the p@@ rec@@ e@@ p@@ t that no more force may be used than is necessary to achieve the military objective .
for this reason we need information and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch on weapons systems which are less h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful than the one we have been dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing today .
this is where the European Parliament can ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise its responsibility in the framework of European security and de@@ f@@ ence policy by making its own con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions .
Mr President , H@@ i@@ g@@ h @-@ R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , the man@@ d@@ ate which you had for action in Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a was not a man@@ d@@ ate to use weapons which the con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ence of h@@ u@@ man@@ ity re@@ j@@ ec@@ ts and con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ s and the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity of which , as m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red now , was k@@ no@@ w@@ n to military le@@ ad@@ ers at the time .
if now that dis@@ c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ u@@ res have be@@ gu@@ n and more will follow , you feel al@@ ar@@ m@@ ed by this fact , to se@@ e@@ k ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ic@@ es in this Parliament that is , I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say , e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of co@@ w@@ ar@@ d@@ ice and b@@ a@@ d ta@@ st@@ e .
Mr President , we are wor@@ ri@@ ed about the effects of these b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s in the Balkans , we are wor@@ ri@@ ed about the s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers who to@@ o@@ k part and we are wor@@ ri@@ ed about the in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of the areas which b@@ ec@@ a@@ me b@@ att@@ le@@ fi@@ el@@ ds . we call for a b@@ road environmental in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into any de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation in the environment throughout the Balkans .
our concern has re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed pro@@ por@@ tions which you cannot be@@ g@@ in to i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine here in the House , at least a@@ m@@ on@@ g public opinion in my country .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution also c@@ al@@ l@@ s for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f ) ( A@@ p@@ pla@@ use )
Mr President , just three points , because a great deal has already been said .
first : I should like to say to Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a that when , in 1999 , we and some of our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w members t@@ ri@@ ed to find out if depleted uranium was being used in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , there was a co@@ v@@ er @-@ up and Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m - I have the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes here - said in re@@ p@@ ly to a question that there was still no con@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion that depleted uranium was used in the conflict .
that is what it sa@@ y@@ s in the ver@@ b@@ a@@ ti@@ m report .
secondly : depleted uranium is a d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous and h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful su@@ b@@ st@@ ance , especially when used in sh@@ el@@ l@@ s because on impact it va@@ por@@ is@@ es , pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es uranium o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e and t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ s into a c@@ l@@ ou@@ d which can be in@@ h@@ al@@ ed and the uranium o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e is re@@ ad@@ il@@ y s@@ ol@@ u@@ ble and can get into the w@@ a@@ ter and food c@@ ha@@ in .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently - and you must know that there is no h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful cause which does not actually cause h@@ ar@@ m , even in small d@@ o@@ ses - an on@@ going e@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ em@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical st@@ u@@ d@@ y is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed both in the G@@ ul@@ f and in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and , of course , in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , although any results there , if they do ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r , will not do so until a la@@ ter d@@ ate .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly : if we accept , and you Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a accept , that this re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed , in sh@@ or@@ t , to un@@ co@@ v@@ er the t@@ r@@ u@@ th , should the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle not apply ?
if s@@ om@@ e@@ one sa@@ y@@ s to me , or to an@@ y@@ one for that matter , look , we need to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out a sur@@ v@@ e@@ y because your h@@ ou@@ se may c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se , am I going to st@@ a@@ y in@@ d@@ o@@ or@@ s while the sur@@ v@@ e@@ y is carried out or am I going to get out and w@@ a@@ it for the results ?
it st@@ an@@ ds to reason and I do not accept that depleted uranium is the only w@@ e@@ ap@@ on at NATO &apos;s dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ al ; it has a h@@ o@@ s@@ t of other e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent weapons in its ar@@ s@@ en@@ al .
Mr President , we here have now been as@@ su@@ red from various qu@@ ar@@ ters that information will be given and matters dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed op@@ en@@ ly .
until now that op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s has been mis@@ sing .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally we must have the right information to support our action , but I have the same op@@ in@@ i@@ ons as have been ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed here with regard to pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle into practice .
we have as our next point for discussion the issue of a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion we clearly have to adopt a position on our approach to the matter of people &apos; s health , although we might not see a di@@ rec@@ t con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , for in@@ st@@ ance , with le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a .
it is very possible that other h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful effects , for example in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter , will be e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent in the long term .
can we really work on the basis that when we do good and s@@ ol@@ ve con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts , at the same time we will be c@@ a@@ using the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population so much an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y and in@@ security in the future ?
Mr President , I find it s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly b@@ i@@ z@@ ar@@ r@@ e to t@@ al@@ k about the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle in relation to weapons , which are after all de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to be b@@ a@@ d for your health .
the problem , of course , is that you only have to m@@ en@@ tion the wor@@ d &quot; uranium &quot; and there is an ou@@ t@@ b@@ re@@ a@@ k of what can only be d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed as ma@@ s@@ s h@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ a .
of course , the il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses and de@@ a@@ th@@ s must be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ated and I welcome the action taken by NATO m@@ em@@ b@@ er st@@ a@@ tes to that end , but we have to make a j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment on the f@@ ac@@ ts and the f@@ ac@@ ts are very clear at the moment .
there is no l@@ in@@ k between depleted uranium and the il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
if we look at the st@@ u@@ d@@ y of G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r v@@ e@@ ter@@ ans that was done in the United States and com@@ par@@ e that with the st@@ u@@ d@@ y of the control group , there is no di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the death ra@@ tes , or il@@ l@@ ness ra@@ tes , or the ra@@ tes of c@@ an@@ c@@ er between the two groups .
we must ensure that we are working on the basis of s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m at the moment , when there is no s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c l@@ in@@ k between the two .
there are a l@@ o@@ t of other issues to do with the B@@ al@@ k@@ an W@@ a@@ r which we should be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ating , like u@@ n@@ e@@ x@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ded c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er b@@ om@@ b@@ s and the environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge which the Commission has ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed , but let us st@@ ic@@ k to the f@@ ac@@ ts .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank all the Members who have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en , since the way they have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en and their f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ness clearly d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that we all share the same wish for c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication on this situation . the ch@@ i@@ e@@ f concern we all must have is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly for the people who are currently il@@ l and those who may become il@@ l and su@@ f@@ f@@ er in the future .
I therefore once again pr@@ om@@ ise to provide all the information I can . what you cannot ask me to do is to provide information when I am un@@ able to do so or when I have no information .
this is an issue which by its very nature li@@ es within the re@@ m@@ it of national governments and we are n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y therefore de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on the information pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al governments .
as I said in my op@@ en@@ ing s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , I am in con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the governments and organisations working on this issue and once again I can as@@ sure you that the Council and I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally will make available all the information we have with the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m of transparency .
it would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have .
secondly , I would like to say that , as some of you have p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , we must k@@ e@@ e@@ p all the v@@ ar@@ i@@ ab@@ l@@ es open in the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c an@@ al@@ y@@ ses . we must not f@@ o@@ c@@ us on certain par@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ ters and for@@ get others which may have effects which are e@@ qu@@ ally d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ ing to health .
I am therefore d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to have he@@ ar@@ d both the Commission and some of the Members who have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en ex@@ p@@ res@@ s a w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to an@@ al@@ y@@ se all the aspects which may have an environmental impact .
I can te@@ l@@ l you that I , too , am a s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t , a p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ is@@ t , by training .
I am not going to re@@ g@@ al@@ e you with all I le@@ ar@@ n@@ t at the time , even if I could re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er much of it , but I do think it important for us to adopt a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al att@@ it@@ u@@ de to this problem and to w@@ a@@ it to c@@ ol@@ late all the available information before as@@ se@@ s@@ sing the full im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations .
right now , no@@ b@@ od@@ y should have any d@@ ou@@ b@@ t but that all the countries and all the international organisations are doing their u@@ t@@ most to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to this problem , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing together the most re@@ le@@ v@@ ant information as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible .
a great many things have been said , all very in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing .
I have taken no@@ te of e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing , but I do not want to go through each point in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ ally since not many ac@@ t@@ u@@ al qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons have been as@@ k@@ ed .
I would , however , like to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to some of the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments that have been made in order to pre@@ v@@ ent any mis@@ under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s .
let me , in all f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ness and a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ tion , con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that I received the le@@ t@@ ter from the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s / European F@@ re@@ e A@@ l@@ li@@ ance and - as they themselves know , because I s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e to them - I con@@ v@@ e@@ y@@ ed the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge and made the le@@ t@@ ter available to the H@@ e@@ ad@@ s of Government and M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of the Union .
the le@@ t@@ ter was an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red ver@@ b@@ ally and not in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing , but you are aware that the decision which the governments to@@ o@@ k was to continue al@@ on@@ g the r@@ ou@@ te they had already un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en in M@@ a@@ y , which was the time I actually received the le@@ t@@ ter .
so , p@@ le@@ a@@ se do not think that no one pa@@ i@@ d any attention to the le@@ t@@ ter I received .
the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge was taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation , but the governments still dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed upon a course other than that proposed in the le@@ t@@ ter .
le@@ t@@ ters from any of the members of political groups in this Parliament are always taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation , and I would like you to be as@@ su@@ red of that .
I have two ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions which are al@@ most per@@ s@@ on@@ al ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions .
firstly , I make a very clear d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion between en@@ ds and means .
I would not like to be acc@@ used of con@@ f@@ using the en@@ ds with the means .
I am per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ing between en@@ ds and means and I know very well that en@@ ds are the important th@@ ing and that ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing the en@@ ds de@@ pen@@ ds very much on the means em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed .
different means , and our as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of them , change over time .
there are o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons when the information available su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ s that particular means may be u@@ se@@ ful or may have c@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ d to be u@@ se@@ ful , and in con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing these cases we have to take account of the information available at the p@@ rec@@ ise time when decisions are taken .
I would therefore like to make it clear that that I am not con@@ f@@ using en@@ ds with means .
I have n@@ e@@ v@@ er done so and I would hope n@@ e@@ v@@ er to do so .
I would like to say something to those who acc@@ use me of having as@@ k@@ ed this Parliament for its com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity . in no way am I as@@ king Parliament for its com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity , not now , not ever .
you re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the will of the people of the European Union and you are responsible for your own actions .
what I have , and what I believe I must share with you , are the m@@ om@@ ents when we have agreed years or m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago .
that does not mean I am using Parliament or making it com@@ pl@@ ic@@ it .
if I say it once or if I say it a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and ti@@ m@@ es , I fully accept my res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , I always have and I always will , that is my in@@ t@@ en@@ tion , without the need to make an@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y com@@ pl@@ ic@@ it .
what I need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility .
I am acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting min@@ e and you must accept y@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
and we cannot d@@ en@@ y that the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions adopted by this Parliament g@@ a@@ ve me food for th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t .
your res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions were important to me when I c@@ ha@@ i@@ red the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of the European Union and also to the H@@ e@@ ad@@ s of State and Government of the European Union .
that is not making an@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y com@@ pl@@ ic@@ it .
that is sh@@ ar@@ ing responsibility like the responsible E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans all of us are here .
we must be able to share and to accept our c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tive responsibility .
I have nothing el@@ se to say .
I would like to thank you and also to in@@ for@@ m you that I shall be com@@ ing back here on 3@@ 1 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary for a debate on the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st , but I shall re@@ main at your dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ al during the pl@@ en@@ ary se@@ s@@ sion to continue dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing this very important issue since it is one in which we have a l@@ o@@ t at st@@ a@@ k@@ e , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y our c@@ re@@ di@@ bility and also our ability to continue to make progress in the area of European Union crisis management .
in this respect , ladies and gentlemen , p@@ le@@ a@@ se be as@@ su@@ red that you can c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on me , at least on my good will . that you can c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on my k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge is not so certain .
Mr President , I also want to start by sa@@ ying thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament for their st@@ a@@ te@@ ments , because they have under@@ l@@ in@@ ed the need to take s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly the fe@@ ar@@ s and an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es in respect of all those who su@@ f@@ f@@ er from s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om@@ s and il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses as well as the need to g@@ a@@ th@@ er all available information and to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine also the long @-@ term health effects .
the Commission , I as@@ sure you , will do all in its power and com@@ p@@ et@@ ence to establish a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c basis in relation to this issue and we will also , of course , co@@ op@@ er@@ ate fully with other national and international bo@@ di@@ es working in this field : NATO , U@@ N@@ E@@ P , I@@ A@@ E@@ A and the W@@ or@@ l@@ d H@@ e@@ al@@ th O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation .
the Commission &apos;s efforts will be in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into our w@@ i@@ d@@ er programme of support in the Balkans with respect to health and the environment , because we must look at the acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted effects .
we also welcome the opportunity to report back to the European Parliament on the progress of our efforts to establish a s@@ ol@@ i@@ d s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c basis on the effects of depleted uranium .
we would like to come back to report to you and of course we are always w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to an@@ s@@ w@@ er any qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons that you might have .
Mr President , I just want to take the opportunity of as@@ king Commissioner W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m and others to speak in their res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es here in the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er - in Mrs W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m &apos; s case , Swedish .
thank you very much , Mrs E@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ s@@ s@@ on .
the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights sa@@ y@@ s that the European Union is a uni@@ on of free countries , and everyone is free to speak in w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er l@@ an@@ gu@@ age he or she c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ ses .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I have just been l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the te@@ x@@ t of the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution .
I should like to point out that the n@@ a@@ me in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated as si@@ g@@ n@@ ing for the L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al Group , the L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l , is most welcome to j@@ o@@ in our Group .
I should like to place on the rec@@ or@@ d how p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d we are to have a new m@@ em@@ b@@ er today who si@@ g@@ n@@ s on our behalf .
well , by the time of the vote we shall have e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed which groups L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l does and does not b@@ el@@ on@@ g to .
I should like to in@@ for@@ m the House that I have received se@@ v@@ en mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions under R@@ u@@ le 3@@ 7 ( 2 ) of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e as well as one j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution s@@ p@@ on@@ s@@ o@@ red by si@@ x groups .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place at 1@@ 2 no@@ on t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
Mr President , on a point of order .
perhaps we could just se@@ t@@ t@@ le that point of order now .
L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l is , and re@@ ma@@ in@@ s , f@@ ir@@ m@@ ly a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Group .
Mr V@@ an O@@ r@@ d@@ en , I cannot allow you to make st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on behalf of L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l un@@ less you have w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ is@@ ation from h@@ i@@ m .
Mr President , since we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the j@@ o@@ in@@ t resolution on the B@@ al@@ k@@ an s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e , I would just like to point out that my own n@@ a@@ me and that of my group have been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded er@@ r@@ on@@ e@@ ou@@ s@@ ly on this j@@ o@@ in@@ t resolution .
Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z , I ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly said a j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution s@@ p@@ on@@ s@@ o@@ red by si@@ x groups , not se@@ v@@ en .
I am th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with the s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ities of your group on this point , which is why I s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fied it quite ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly .
ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 2 / 2000 ) by Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n , on behalf of the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , on the proposal for a Council R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ O@@ M ( 2000 ) 1@@ 1@@ 9 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 2@@ 7@@ 2 / 2000 - 2000 / 0@@ 0@@ 8@@ 1 ( C@@ N@@ S ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; on the c@@ re@@ ation of a R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
Mr President , this proposal is about money for an in@@ st@@ ant , non @-@ military res@@ p@@ on@@ se by the Union to c@@ r@@ is@@ es .
it is first p@@ il@@ la@@ r - for those who understand Union j@@ ar@@ g@@ on - and is d@@ ri@@ v@@ en by the Commission .
it is not a military , ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force , which is , of course , second p@@ il@@ la@@ r , and d@@ ri@@ v@@ en by the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters .
however , I have been in@@ v@@ ited , l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed and as@@ k@@ ed how I am going to de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y &apos;s s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , t@@ an@@ ks and pl@@ an@@ es .
I have been as@@ k@@ ed whether we are going to use n@@ a@@ va@@ l b@@ a@@ se@@ s in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us and to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence of C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
I want to make it ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly clear that this is nothing to do with the military ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force : this is a financial f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity for the Commission to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to c@@ r@@ is@@ es very ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly .
although the Commission will de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y the money as f@@ a@@ st as is necessary , Parliament re@@ ta@@ in@@ s control as one h@@ al@@ f of the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
we shall vote the money and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has s@@ p@@ ent the money .
we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the Commission to s@@ pen@@ d the money on res@@ p@@ on@@ ding to c@@ r@@ is@@ es by b@@ u@@ ying m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es , h@@ ir@@ ing d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s or n@@ ur@@ ses , ch@@ ar@@ ter@@ ing a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y the m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es , n@@ ur@@ ses or p@@ ol@@ ic@@ em@@ en - w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red - to the crisis , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er it is - not n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y within Europe .
in the past the Union has been ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised for being s@@ l@@ o@@ w in res@@ p@@ on@@ ding to c@@ r@@ is@@ es .
we have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to s@@ en@@ d an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate res@@ p@@ on@@ se when it was most ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly re@@ qu@@ i@@ red , and this proposal is part of Commissioner P@@ att@@ en &apos;s p@@ ra@@ is@@ e@@ wor@@ th@@ y efforts to improve the Union &apos;s aid programme , which is in a b@@ it of a m@@ e@@ s@@ s , to say the least .
I hope very much that Parliament will support it , and I will come back to that .
we would be very in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed to know whether , when the Commissioner res@@ p@@ on@@ ds to this debate , he would be able to ou@@ t@@ line the t@@ y@@ p@@ es of s@@ it@@ u@@ ations that he en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ es this may be used for - although , of course , we have some i@@ d@@ e@@ as ourselves .
I have been as@@ k@@ ed by a number of c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es who have re@@ a@@ d the report why , if it is such a good idea , there are so many amendments in it .
the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al Commission proposal was d@@ ated A@@ p@@ ri@@ l last year , but after that nothing ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed .
it was b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed , it ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s , by the French Presidency , with no ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of what was ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing .
so I tabled a question at Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion T@@ im@@ e as@@ king for an ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation and m@@ i@@ ra@@ c@@ ul@@ ou@@ s@@ ly - but ma@@ y@@ be there was no con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion - the French Presidency and the Commission g@@ o@@ t together to n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate to re@@ mo@@ ve the b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge .
they c@@ a@@ me up with an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve te@@ x@@ t but , I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say , the Council has n@@ e@@ v@@ er had the c@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ s@@ y to in@@ for@@ m Parliament of the new ver@@ sion of the te@@ x@@ t .
so the many amendments in my report are an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to a@@ m@@ en@@ d the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al proposal and for us to com@@ ment on the new com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise te@@ x@@ t which we ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed to ob@@ ta@@ in , even though it was n@@ e@@ v@@ er given to us o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ally .
Parliament has only one re@@ ad@@ ing on this , which is another re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion which was not cor@@ rec@@ ted at the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it of the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ f@@ ic@@ it .
it should , of course , be c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on , but it is not .
however , we were able to th@@ re@@ at@@ en to use our s@@ in@@ g@@ le re@@ ad@@ ing to w@@ i@@ th@@ h@@ ol@@ d it - like the f@@ a@@ m@@ ous is@@ o@@ g@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ s@@ e case some years ago - and if we w@@ i@@ th@@ h@@ ol@@ d an opinion , nothing further can ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
so we have an effective v@@ e@@ to .
but , ha@@ p@@ p@@ il@@ y , the committee in Parliament has l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed at this proposal in great de@@ ta@@ i@@ l and is in favour of it .
h@@ ence the many amendments proposed by the committee .
finally - I am not going to go into the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the amendments - I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to say that the committee adopted the amendments al@@ most un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , with the s@@ in@@ g@@ le ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ v@@ es .
they will no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t ex@@ pla@@ in why that was so .
that was the par@@ ty which I f@@ el@@ t ob@@ li@@ ged to ab@@ an@@ d@@ on because it had become to@@ t@@ ally n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve about Europe .
I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ ted support .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s w@@ el@@ comes the proposed ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
we support this Community m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m , which is de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to make resources available for ur@@ g@@ ent non @-@ com@@ b@@ at ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities re@@ la@@ ted to crisis management and conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
it is right and f@@ it@@ t@@ ing that the European Union should help to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve or re@@ st@@ or@@ e public order and to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate dialogue , con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation , m@@ ed@@ i@@ ation and the pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion of human rights ab@@ u@@ se@@ s .
all of this , however , can only be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed or become ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ va@@ ble if the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity really is able to res@@ p@@ on@@ d ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly .
that is why we em@@ p@@ ha@@ ti@@ c@@ ally support the Commission &apos;s proposal that implementation be based on the committee system , including the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of an ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y committee , with the em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the wor@@ d &apos; ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y &apos; .
now over the years , as you know , the Commission - with P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y b@@ ac@@ king , I ha@@ st@@ en to ad@@ d - has been pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing a strategy of gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally trans@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities from the a@@ m@@ b@@ it of the common f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n and security policy , in other words from the second p@@ il@@ la@@ r of the European uni@@ fication process , to that of the Community , the first p@@ il@@ la@@ r .
this t@@ r@@ end is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed by the current proposal for the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
so far , so good .
but the funds for this pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e must be al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated under H@@ e@@ ad@@ ing 4 of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
and all Members of this House have been made aware by at least the last two b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses just how ti@@ g@@ h@@ t our fin@@ an@@ c@@ es are in the f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n @-@ policy b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
every year , this al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation has been the subject of our b@@ it@@ te@@ re@@ st b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y w@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ ling with the Council .
we have no need of a c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al b@@ all to pre@@ d@@ ic@@ t a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r situation this year .
for that reason we have as@@ k@@ ed the le@@ a@@ d committee to do two things : firstly , to call on the Commission and Council to ou@@ t@@ line their in@@ t@@ en@@ tions and particularly to ex@@ pla@@ in how they in@@ t@@ end to di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e up res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities between themselves in this field and how they in@@ t@@ end to fin@@ ance the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities , and , secondly , to ad@@ d a rec@@ it@@ al to the proposed te@@ x@@ t st@@ ating quite clearly that ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions must be fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed within H@@ e@@ ad@@ ing 4 .
should that be im@@ possible , pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on must be made for a re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
in addition , we want an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to con@@ su@@ l@@ t Parliament on each action to be fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed under the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
the rapporteur and the le@@ a@@ d committee have com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with these b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y w@@ is@@ h@@ es .
for this we are very gra@@ te@@ ful to them .
Mr President , the European Commission bo@@ a@@ st@@ s a whole ra@@ f@@ t of com@@ p@@ et@@ ences which are important in terms of a civil contribution to k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing those s@@ it@@ u@@ ations under control which th@@ re@@ at@@ en to get out of hand .
those com@@ p@@ et@@ ences can be de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in the st@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ ation p@@ ha@@ se following a v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent conflict , to pre@@ v@@ ent the situation from h@@ it@@ t@@ ing crisis point again .
in addition to the u@@ su@@ al aid per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l , these com@@ p@@ et@@ ences also in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve m@@ on@@ it@@ or@@ s , the de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment of government o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als , tra@@ in@@ ers and p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e .
they trans@@ late into projects and aid policy s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to bring st@@ ability to a certain region .
we very much welcome the d@@ im@@ en@@ sion of political and or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al co@@ h@@ er@@ ence in all these civil in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments in the form of a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
in this way , the EU &apos; s responsibility for the international legal order can be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed much more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , it g@@ i@@ v@@ es the Commission and the com@@ p@@ et@@ ent Commissioner a ch@@ ance to bring forward their own initiatives and proposals in this field .
in our opinion , the in@@ ter@@ pla@@ y between the rapporteur and the Commission has led to an excellent resolution .
particular efforts have been made to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing or ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing su@@ per@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ous st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res which d@@ el@@ a@@ y the decision @-@ making process .
the rapporteur is right to point out the need for funding this f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity and the need for a well @-@ tra@@ in@@ ed uni@@ t for financial management and implementation .
my group pre@@ f@@ ers the Commission te@@ x@@ t to the rapporteur &apos; s amendments on a number of s@@ co@@ res .
for in@@ st@@ ance , I find the l@@ is@@ t of ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es and g@@ o@@ als in A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1 ( 1 ) , which is what the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity will s@@ er@@ ve to achieve , very u@@ se@@ ful .
the report m@@ en@@ tions the clear in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of the European Parliament in the policy .
given the f@@ ra@@ g@@ m@@ en@@ ted commitment of the Member States , also in the future , the report is right to call for a system of information ex@@ change .
who k@@ no@@ ws whether more far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation and gu@@ i@@ d@@ ance will be possible in the time to come .
we le@@ ar@@ n from our k@@ no@@ c@@ k @-@ b@@ ac@@ ks , al@@ be@@ it with some d@@ el@@ a@@ y .
B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a @-@ H@@ er@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ in@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o are important ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es where a great deal w@@ ent w@@ r@@ on@@ g and , s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly but su@@ re@@ ly , we le@@ ar@@ n@@ t from our mis@@ ta@@ k@@ es .
the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity is , as far as this is concerned , an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous st@@ e@@ p forward .
we hope , of course , that it will need to be de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed as little as possible , but that is w@@ is@@ h@@ ful th@@ in@@ king .
we know that in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , it is u@@ se@@ ful to have this op@@ tion up your s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , as a com@@ pl@@ ement to the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly mo@@ b@@ il@@ ised military uni@@ t which f@@ al@@ l@@ s within the re@@ m@@ it of Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a .
we think that in future , the European Union &apos; s civil in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments will matter most in the s@@ p@@ here of ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing law and order , and this is , of course , also what we want .
for we too , like everyone el@@ se , would like to c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e civil in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments over military in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , but we need not p@@ res@@ s this point too much in this ar@@ en@@ a , given the large de@@ g@@ re@@ e of h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ ation w@@ h@@ en@@ ever the need ar@@ is@@ es to de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y military in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments .
Mr President , I would like to start by con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ ting Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n , who gu@@ i@@ d@@ ed us so ex@@ per@@ tly through this com@@ p@@ le@@ x pre@@ par@@ ation of the report in the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence , and has done so again .
by way of example and e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence , I can con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that only one amendment was tabled for the pl@@ en@@ ary with regard to his report .
our group will , in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , support that amendment .
the proposal to in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity by means of which financial resources can be f@@ re@@ ed up qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es the un@@ qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied support of my group .
it is our ex@@ p@@ res@@ s pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence to de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y civil in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments first in the e@@ v@@ ent of a th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ing conflict situation .
this is the second con@@ c@@ re@@ te st@@ e@@ p in that con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , after for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ting the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment of a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly mo@@ b@@ il@@ ised p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force .
we are w@@ a@@ it@@ ing with b@@ ated b@@ re@@ at@@ h for a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed proposal for a to@@ ta@@ l pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge with so @-@ called &quot; he@@ ad@@ line g@@ o@@ als &quot; in this area .
we would like to see a b@@ al@@ ance st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k between the EU efforts in the fi@@ el@@ ds of civil and military crisis management .
the EU must be able to res@@ p@@ on@@ d qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly in em@@ er@@ g@@ ency s@@ it@@ u@@ ations with a w@@ i@@ d@@ e and well @-@ att@@ un@@ ed r@@ an@@ ge of in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments at its dis@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ al .
this is why si@@ m@@ p@@ le procedures are being proposed for the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
com@@ it@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y can be a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ed by re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing within the Community framework .
however , in th@@ e@@ or@@ y this l@@ im@@ its the number of countries where the in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment can be de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed , but we do not f@@ o@@ re@@ see any p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al problems .
where is the European Union not ac@@ tive ?
in cases where the Commission makes a for@@ ma@@ l proposal - which is under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ able - to de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity so as to guarantee the implementation of EU programmes , we would like to see the term &apos; EU policy &apos; ad@@ ded .
this will w@@ i@@ d@@ en the sc@@ op@@ e .
in order not to h@@ in@@ d@@ er e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , we have su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed not defin@@ ing the financial b@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ar@@ ies be@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ hand , or including ti@@ m@@ e@@ f@@ ra@@ m@@ es in the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity must be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble by nature .
we would ask the Commission , especially in the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing , to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out many and f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments , and to report on these to our Parliament .
in this context , we are also very k@@ e@@ en to find out how the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity will re@@ la@@ te to the E@@ C@@ H@@ O programme .
this is a new in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment , and we can le@@ ar@@ n from its g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing pa@@ in@@ s .
finally , I should like to ask whether the Commissioner would be pre@@ pa@@ red to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s possible sc@@ en@@ ar@@ i@@ o@@ s for commitment at some point in the future , for we are now th@@ e@@ or@@ is@@ ing about in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , but we must also t@@ al@@ k about the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations at some stage , and for this pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e , a sc@@ en@@ ar@@ i@@ o discussion would , I believe , be very de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble .
Mr President , when things go w@@ r@@ on@@ g in a certain region , the world has come to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t ever more from Europe , and ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly so .
we have the means , the or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al set @-@ up and in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to help in em@@ er@@ g@@ ency s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , and from that point of view , A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a can ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t pre@@ c@@ i@@ ous little from A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a under B@@ u@@ s@@ h .
that is why I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e the military uni@@ t and to su@@ p@@ pl@@ ement E@@ C@@ H@@ O .
this new m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m will certainly m@@ e@@ e@@ t a need , so much so that d@@ em@@ and could s@@ o@@ on ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed su@@ p@@ p@@ ly .
in my opinion , the resources available for this year are an in@@ su@@ l@@ t to the serious commitment of the R@@ R@@ M .
even if the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t is d@@ ou@@ b@@ led or t@@ re@@ b@@ led in la@@ ter years , it re@@ ma@@ in@@ s a j@@ o@@ k@@ e com@@ pa@@ red to the many initiatives which can qu@@ al@@ i@@ fy for R@@ R@@ M action .
it is about f@@ a@@ st decision @-@ making , ac@@ ting and funding .
the im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve l@@ is@@ t of op@@ er@@ ations from the o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise excellent N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n report comes , therefore , as a b@@ it of a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s many important ta@@ s@@ ks of a not en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly p@@ res@@ sing nature , such as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing education , monitoring el@@ ec@@ tions or c@@ le@@ ar@@ ing min@@ es .
could the Commissioner c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy what , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to h@@ i@@ m , the sc@@ op@@ e of ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation will need to be , also in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of l@@ im@@ ited financial resources ?
the R@@ R@@ M initiative , a first p@@ il@@ la@@ r con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion under the re@@ m@@ it of the Commission , ap@@ p@@ e@@ als to me .
it is of u@@ t@@ most importance for our Parliament to be to@@ t@@ ally involved .
will we be in@@ for@@ m@@ ed about proposed action in good time ?
we often he@@ a@@ r about issues of com@@ p@@ et@@ ence and ri@@ v@@ al@@ r@@ y between Mr P@@ att@@ en and Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a ; a d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of ta@@ s@@ ks between the governments and the Commission in terms of military and civil a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s is very much an op@@ tion on pa@@ per , but could well le@@ a@@ d to major problems in re@@ al@@ ity .
can the Commissioner give us any re@@ as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce in this respect ?
European p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , military and c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an action must be co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y . this is another ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion which the world has of us , and ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly so .
Mr President , ever since A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am the Union has been pr@@ ou@@ d@@ ly pro@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ing its role as a f@@ ir@@ e b@@ ri@@ g@@ ad@@ e for c@@ r@@ is@@ es in Europe .
the only problem is that it does not even p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ s b@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ts with which to draw w@@ a@@ ter .
with the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity , the Union has now ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red some b@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ts at least , and I do welcome that .
however , I should have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to see this f@@ ir@@ e b@@ ri@@ g@@ ad@@ e e@@ qu@@ i@@ p itself with h@@ o@@ ses too , but Members of this House are a@@ m@@ on@@ g those who have t@@ ol@@ d us that , while this f@@ un@@ d does not m@@ e@@ e@@ t all our needs , f@@ ir@@ e h@@ o@@ ses are simply ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve com@@ m@@ od@@ ities .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity is a st@@ e@@ p forward , but I must r@@ e @-@ em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that it is still a l@@ op@@ si@@ d@@ ed m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m , because it only funds action after the e@@ v@@ ent .
far greater importance su@@ re@@ ly at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es to action before the e@@ v@@ ent , to pre@@ v@@ en@@ tive measures .
p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e for@@ c@@ es al@@ one cannot pre@@ v@@ ent c@@ r@@ is@@ es , which is why we also ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t funding to be pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for the European c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an peace cor@@ p@@ s that Parliament called for in its resolution of 1999 , and we ask D@@ r S@@ ol@@ an@@ a to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e these things more per@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n on his report and for the e@@ a@@ se with which the committee has taken on bo@@ ar@@ d all s@@ or@@ ts of su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
we consider the Commission &apos; s initiative to be an important one .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , I must point out that , although in our Group , the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ al Group of the European United L@@ e@@ f@@ t / N@@ or@@ di@@ c G@@ re@@ en L@@ e@@ f@@ t , there is , under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ ab@@ ly , no s@@ in@@ g@@ le point of view on this issue , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of us are in favour of this ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force .
we believe that it is important , that it must be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed as a European Community policy , and that greater em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s must be pla@@ c@@ ed on conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion as part of Europe &apos; s contribution to peace .
we would therefore have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to have seen greater funding al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated , and better co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between the various ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able programmes to improve their e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , as well as greater c@@ o @-@ responsibility when it comes to the e@@ v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ al - and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es , unfortunately , necessary - military in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , which would perhaps not become necessary if the e@@ ar@@ li@@ er st@@ ag@@ es were carried out pro@@ per@@ ly .
Mr President , the discussion on the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity is st@@ ar@@ ting to d@@ ra@@ g .
Member States are still not agreed on the n@@ u@@ ts and b@@ ol@@ ts of this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
ap@@ par@@ ently , it will also be some time before agreement is re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed , and that while the financial im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations for the Member States are min@@ i@@ ma@@ l .
there is no need for them to increase their con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to the Union &apos; s external policy , they only need to g@@ r@@ an@@ t ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the sh@@ i@@ f@@ ting of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing resources .
la@@ b@@ or@@ i@@ ous n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations have once again s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous g@@ o@@ als regarding one of the Union &apos; s external policies e@@ va@@ por@@ ate in practice because of the f@@ ir@@ m p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons held by the national Member States .
re@@ mo@@ v@@ ing the g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion of programmes c@@ re@@ ated by the Union is not a l@@ ic@@ ence for the European Union to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e an@@ y@@ where in the world at will .
I therefore ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d the s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ s which have been ad@@ ded to the report of the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y with regard to this proposal .
this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally f@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ se@@ s on actions within the context of European programmes .
this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m can provide help where the implementation of those programmes is at r@@ is@@ k due to crisis s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
however , I do not share the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the report on a different sc@@ or@@ e .
indeed , un@@ like the rapporteur , I wish to re@@ ta@@ in the crisis committee from the Commission proposal .
in this way , we will pre@@ v@@ ent a situation from ar@@ is@@ ing where initiatives m@@ e@@ e@@ t with in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent b@@ ac@@ king within Member States .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we will l@@ end the Union &apos; s and Member States &apos; initiatives the necessary co@@ h@@ er@@ ence .
not in@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant , in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of all the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m which the Union &apos; s external action has had to put up with over the years .
I also have my res@@ er@@ va@@ tions about the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons made in the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment with regard to the amendment of the legal basis of this regulation .
A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 3@@ 0@@ 8 is the only ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le on which this proposal can be based .
mo@@ re@@ over , I w@@ on@@ d@@ er whether the addition of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 7@@ 9 will b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed of this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
it ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to me that c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on for Parliament will d@@ el@@ a@@ y matters un@@ n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y .
what we do need to be able to do is to call the Commission to account a@@ f@@ ter@@ w@@ ar@@ ds on the use of this m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
Mr President , the proposal for a regulation c@@ re@@ ating a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity is one of those which are f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded on th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly la@@ u@@ d@@ able in@@ t@@ en@@ tions but which are li@@ able to f@@ a@@ i@@ l as a result of red ta@@ p@@ e and t@@ u@@ r@@ f w@@ ar@@ s .
the European Union has pla@@ y@@ ed a rather un@@ con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing role h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to in the re@@ al@@ m of ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action and conflict resolution .
the reason for this does not se@@ e@@ m to li@@ e so much in a sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of man@@ power or financial commitment as in a f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to man@@ age , plan and co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate initiatives and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
be that as it may , the dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation of in@@ t@@ ent to become more ac@@ tive in the resolution of con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts and in crisis management must be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted as an important st@@ e@@ p in the right di@@ rec@@ tion .
the EU has s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es done mar@@ v@@ el@@ l@@ ous things to improve the situation in crisis @-@ t@@ or@@ n areas , especially with financial resources .
but money is no su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te for political will and political in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence .
if the EU w@@ is@@ h@@ es to pla@@ y a more pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent role in future , it must have the political will to in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve itself more ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in the implementation of appropriate measures .
I am only the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of a small country , but I can as@@ sure you that A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a , with its long tra@@ d@@ ition of n@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ ity and non @-@ al@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment , has a@@ ma@@ s@@ sed a particular w@@ e@@ al@@ th of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in the d@@ om@@ a@@ in@@ s of political m@@ ed@@ i@@ ation and crisis management , which makes parties to a conflict more w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to accept it as a m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ to@@ r .
perhaps this is one of the very areas in which the EU should be making greater use of the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence of its s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ er countries .
crisis management and m@@ ed@@ i@@ ation at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts are not so much about h@@ u@@ ge financial resources and large b@@ l@@ o@@ ated organisations as about the t@@ r@@ u@@ st that w@@ ar@@ r@@ ing parties are pre@@ pa@@ red to place in an o@@ f@@ f@@ er of in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
and this is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y where the EU has been f@@ a@@ il@@ ing .
we have an i@@ ma@@ ge problem in the e@@ y@@ es of the parties to the n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in the world today .
that cannot be sur@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ted with new ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive un@@ its and financial pl@@ ans al@@ one .
what is really la@@ c@@ king is a c@@ re@@ di@@ ble de@@ si@@ r@@ e to as@@ su@@ me greater g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al responsibility in the re@@ al@@ m@@ s of m@@ ed@@ i@@ ation and crisis management .
Mr President , I hope I have the Commissioner &apos;s attention , as he is in con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion with Mr B@@ ro@@ k at the moment .
throughout this Parliament we have been c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for the Commission to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent financial management and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures so that it can d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er external assistance and implement its programmes such as min@@ e action ur@@ g@@ ently , in ti@@ m@@ es of crisis or when li@@ v@@ es are at st@@ a@@ k@@ e .
it se@@ em@@ s to us that this was the under@@ l@@ ying mo@@ tive be@@ h@@ in@@ d Mr P@@ att@@ en &apos;s proposal for the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
I hope this is the case and I would ask for a re@@ as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce on this point from the Commissioner .
it is a p@@ ity that the term &quot; R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity &quot; has been used for what after all should be a pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l matter , a financial management in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment .
it is e@@ a@@ si@@ ly con@@ f@@ u@@ sed with &quot; R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ or@@ ce &quot; ; it has been con@@ f@@ u@@ sed in the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a and even in Parliament &apos;s own se@@ s@@ sion n@@ e@@ ws this w@@ e@@ e@@ k .
perhaps in the interest of c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity and to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d con@@ f@@ u@@ sion , the Commission could change the t@@ it@@ le to something like &quot; U@@ r@@ g@@ ent F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ ing F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity . &quot;
we support the principle as I have d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed it , but one or two un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate el@@ em@@ ents se@@ e@@ m to have c@@ re@@ p@@ t in .
firstly , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity in the context of C@@ F@@ S@@ P and the Commission &apos;s own first p@@ il@@ la@@ r external actions , it has been put into the context of the common security and de@@ f@@ ence policy .
now we have ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed our concerns about the EU m@@ ed@@ d@@ ling in military matters on many o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons and our res@@ er@@ va@@ tions have not been e@@ a@@ se@@ d by de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments at Nice .
this is a se@@ par@@ ate issue .
the Commission &apos;s financial f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity should not be m@@ i@@ x@@ ed up with these de@@ f@@ ence issues .
secondly , there is a th@@ re@@ a@@ d of political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness r@@ un@@ n@@ ing through the proposal .
I am b@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ led for in@@ st@@ ance by the idea that the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against g@@ en@@ d@@ er dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation would f@@ all into the crisis management c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y , t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ ing the use of the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , for us more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n , the rapporteur , has taken the opportunity to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce an amendment in pu@@ r@@ su@@ it of one of his p@@ e@@ t su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a European public security force , in other words a European g@@ en@@ d@@ ar@@ m@@ er@@ i@@ e or ar@@ m@@ ed p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e .
this is the main reason why we cannot accept this report .
we do not want a European ar@@ my and we certainly to not want a European p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force .
we do want the Commission to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out its external assistance with greater e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and we welcome measures to that effect .
Mr President , the European Parliament has always u@@ p@@ held the need to increase the European Union &apos; s non @-@ military in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion c@@ a@@ pa@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
we therefore welcome the Council &apos; s proposal and support Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n &apos; s report , which pu@@ ts forward proposals that improve the te@@ x@@ t .
these are clearly issues which come under the first p@@ il@@ la@@ r .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , we all know that , in the context of the second p@@ il@@ la@@ r , the military m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m of a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force , de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ b@@ er@@ g @-@ t@@ y@@ p@@ e ta@@ s@@ ks , is being c@@ re@@ ated .
it is en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ ed that these ta@@ s@@ ks will be carried out in third countries where the non @-@ military ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m will also op@@ er@@ ate .
but how , and in what cases ?
what kind of procedures will this re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y ?
what kind of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation ?
I therefore think it would have been b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al for the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment to have ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed this as@@ p@@ ec@@ t as well .
as a Member of this Parliament , I wish to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the b@@ re@@ a@@ king down of some of the b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers that se@@ par@@ ate fi@@ el@@ ds of com@@ p@@ et@@ ence from one another so that greater cooperation within the European Union is ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
Mr President , my par@@ ty fully rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ es the need for the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries to make available resources for international c@@ r@@ is@@ es and for our res@@ p@@ on@@ se to be ra@@ p@@ i@@ d and effective .
in this context , the Commission &apos;s proposal l@@ o@@ o@@ ks att@@ ra@@ c@@ tive in that it pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s for a@@ f@@ for@@ ding a res@@ p@@ on@@ se to crisis s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
however , we believe that for our efforts to be both ra@@ p@@ i@@ d and effective , they should be pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed , f@@ un@@ d@@ ed and ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted on a t@@ r@@ u@@ ly international sc@@ al@@ e , u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ing the resources and the c@@ a@@ pa@@ b@@ il@@ ities of the whole free world , including the technical g@@ en@@ i@@ us and the good will of the United States .
the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s for en@@ sur@@ ing this already ex@@ is@@ t in the form of the United N@@ ations and its various ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es .
although im@@ per@@ f@@ ec@@ t and always c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of reform , these ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es have pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed good s@@ er@@ v@@ ice and have re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ed much su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing .
for the future , the way to ensure that res@@ p@@ on@@ ses are ma@@ x@@ im@@ ised is to continue working through these ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es , en@@ sur@@ ing that resources are used w@@ is@@ el@@ y and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
as far as the Commission &apos;s proposal is concerned , this is simply re@@ in@@ v@@ ent@@ ing the w@@ h@@ e@@ e@@ l , pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the political a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons of the European Union before the needs of su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing people .
people in c@@ r@@ is@@ es need a European ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity as much as a f@@ ish needs a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le .
we should ab@@ an@@ d@@ on these g@@ r@@ an@@ di@@ o@@ s@@ e pl@@ ans and in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d support and de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es which have a better tra@@ c@@ k rec@@ or@@ d that the EU will ever have .
Mr President , in dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n M@@ in@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ y that I have just seen today for a g@@ o@@ al @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ted action plan for conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion , because as I have said before , we in the European Union should be s@@ en@@ ding a p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y for peace to areas of conflict and not just ar@@ m@@ i@@ es .
the European Union is the best example in the h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we t@@ en@@ d to for@@ get .
look at the last c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y : the first h@@ al@@ f of it was mar@@ k@@ ed by the wor@@ st conflict the world had ever seen : two world w@@ ar@@ s and m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of people de@@ a@@ d and k@@ il@@ led .
yet who could have f@@ o@@ re@@ seen that in the second h@@ al@@ f of that c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y those same people would come together in the European Union .
as I know from my own ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es at the he@@ ar@@ t of European Union will res@@ ol@@ ve conflict w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er they are ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in the world .
therefore do you not think it is a very positive and s@@ en@@ si@@ ble su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion for the European Union to have a de@@ par@@ t@@ ment that does p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y that ?
in other words , the Commission should have a de@@ par@@ t@@ ment of peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation and a Commissioner for peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation to go to areas of conflict in ad@@ v@@ ance and apply the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of conflict resolution , particularly those pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es at the he@@ ar@@ t of European Union itself .
Mr President , I am very s@@ or@@ r@@ y to have he@@ ar@@ d in the debate M@@ E@@ P@@ s from my own region in the U@@ K from different parties say that they will be op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing this report .
I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to support the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity and I do so as a Member of Parliament &apos;s D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment Committee .
in the w@@ e@@ e@@ k that 6@@ 00 people la@@ y de@@ a@@ d after the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , this European Union must be able to mo@@ ve more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly just as we f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to do in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the impact of h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch in that same country back in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
I ask Commissioner P@@ att@@ en in c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ing the debate , first to as@@ sure us that the f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity will be u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ed in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to c@@ r@@ is@@ es world @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e in support of the EU &apos;s development g@@ o@@ als and not just in Europe &apos;s own b@@ ac@@ k@@ y@@ ar@@ d .
second , could he te@@ l@@ l us how he could make such a pr@@ om@@ ise when year after year the Commission pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses funding in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions in C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe and in the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a at the ex@@ pen@@ se of b@@ u@@ d@@ get l@@ in@@ es b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ ing the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries .
third , will he under@@ take to bring forward a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p between the ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity and the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of E@@ C@@ H@@ O and indeed ex@@ pla@@ in why he has not at one and the same time b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t forward proposals to s@@ p@@ e@@ ed up our h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance as part of the reform programme which he k@@ no@@ ws we support .
finally , can he te@@ l@@ l us is he s@@ ha@@ res our b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f that development is the best form of conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and to com@@ m@@ it h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f to en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ing the EU &apos;s development programme to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d the need for crisis in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion in future years .

B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 5@@ 6@@ 0 / 2000 by Mr B@@ ro@@ k , on behalf of the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , to the Council , on the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s R@@ e@@ public of Korea ,
B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 8@@ 2@@ 5 / 2000 by Mr B@@ ro@@ k , on behalf of the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , to the Commission , on the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s R@@ e@@ public of Korea .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to say a few words on the question tabled by the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , especially on the basis of the fin@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed by Mr S@@ an@@ ter and other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es of ou@@ r@@ s on their v@@ is@@ it to North Korea .
I believe that we in the European Union have a more important role to pla@@ y there than we have pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly done and that our policy cannot st@@ o@@ p at support for the K@@ E@@ D@@ O programme .
it is certainly re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble that , with e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t Member States having now e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations , we have not been able to adopt a con@@ c@@ er@@ ted approach in our de@@ al@@ in@@ g@@ s with North Korea .
last year was an ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ ally in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing one in the K@@ o@@ re@@ an pen@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a , especially on account of the ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between North and S@@ ou@@ th Korea and the re@@ un@@ it@@ ing of f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies that was made possible by this th@@ a@@ w in North @-@ S@@ ou@@ th relations .
we must be aware that this area still has the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al to be a major t@@ r@@ ou@@ ble s@@ p@@ o@@ t , but there is n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s a real political opportunity now to achieve a la@@ st@@ ing peace se@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ ement .
that is why it is essential that the European Union , as an international pla@@ y@@ er in a m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ ol@@ a@@ r political world , should become ac@@ tive in this d@@ om@@ a@@ in .
it is a matter of su@@ p@@ por@@ ting a policy which can pa@@ ve the way for democracy and human rights in North Korea and which , on that basis , can pla@@ y a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant part in the development of ever greater under@@ st@@ an@@ ding between the two par@@ ts of Korea , an under@@ st@@ an@@ ding which , following the meeting between the two P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , has s@@ par@@ k@@ ed o@@ f@@ f the first public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes about national re@@ uni@@ fication for many dec@@ ad@@ es .
such a policy must also be com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with a means of ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the food situation and the health system in North Korea and must en@@ able us to in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate appropriate measures of aid into a political strategy so as to bring about an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in the general situation and perhaps also to in@@ it@@ i@@ ate the development on which the long @-@ term peace of the region de@@ pen@@ ds , for the peace of that region , of course , is of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al importance too .
as an ar@@ m@@ s su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ er , North Korea is an important pla@@ y@@ er on the world stage , and its development of m@@ od@@ er@@ n weapons of ma@@ s@@ s d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion and d@@ el@@ i@@ very systems makes it a country which could un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly p@@ o@@ s@@ e a serious th@@ re@@ at to other par@@ ts of the A@@ si@@ an con@@ t@@ in@@ ent and to other con@@ t@@ in@@ ents .
Madam President , I believe that we must therefore se@@ e@@ k im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in these d@@ om@@ a@@ in@@ s , so as to c@@ ur@@ b the pr@@ ol@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ ation of ar@@ ma@@ ments and th@@ us con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al st@@ ability .
I hope that you will support this motion for a resolution and that the Council and the Commission can agree on a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated approach with Parliament which will en@@ able us to make our contribution in that part of the world , not least in our own interests .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , during the meeting held in P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g between 2@@ 5 and 2@@ 7 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er of last year within the framework of the political dialogue , the European t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed the most important par@@ ts of the European Union &apos; s st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es towards the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea - st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es which had been ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the Council at its m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s on 9 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and 20 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er .
allow me just b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly to m@@ en@@ tion the three most important of these st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es .
first of all , the European Union &apos; s support for work on ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing la@@ st@@ ing peace between the two K@@ o@@ re@@ an States .
secondly , the importance of the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea &apos; s ad@@ op@@ ting a responsible att@@ it@@ u@@ de when it comes to the non @-@ pr@@ ol@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ ation of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r weapons and b@@ al@@ l@@ is@@ ti@@ c mis@@ si@@ l@@ es , as well as pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing a st@@ o@@ p to ex@@ por@@ ts of mis@@ si@@ l@@ es .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , respect for the UN &apos; s C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on Human Rights .
when it comes to e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea , the Council agreed on 20 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er of last year that the in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed parties must con@@ su@@ l@@ t between themselves and in@@ for@@ m the Council of the con@@ t@@ ent of their dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g .
the Council has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly ur@@ g@@ ed the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea to com@@ p@@ ly fully with its com@@ m@@ it@@ ments under the N@@ on @-@ P@@ r@@ ol@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ ation Treaty and c@@ e@@ a@@ se to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , te@@ st or ex@@ por@@ t any mis@@ si@@ l@@ es or mis@@ si@@ le te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
the European Union has also called upon the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea to si@@ g@@ n and ra@@ ti@@ fy the C@@ om@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve N@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r T@@ est B@@ an Treaty .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the European Union has in@@ for@@ m@@ ed the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea that it ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ts con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures to be taken on these issues .
in all con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea , the European Union has em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed its great concern about the serious v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights in the country , about the number of political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , about the ab@@ s@@ ence of national legislation and about the K@@ o@@ re@@ an authorities &apos; re@@ f@@ u@@ sa@@ l to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate with international m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s in de@@ f@@ ence of human rights .
d@@ em@@ an@@ ds have been made for im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents on these issues .
we shall continue to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the importance of these issues .
the European Union w@@ el@@ comes the decision by the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public to re@@ su@@ me its re@@ por@@ ting under the UN C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on C@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l and P@@ ol@@ it@@ ical Rights during the year 2000 and h@@ op@@ es that the country will now , on the basis of its own report , be able to en@@ ter into a u@@ se@@ ful and con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee
on the issue of measures to be taken , the Council has called upon the Commission to be@@ g@@ in de@@ al@@ ing with the issue of technical measures of support which may be taken within those se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s to which priority has been given .
the Council and the Commission will , as s@@ o@@ on as possible , be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing what measures are possible in order to open the European market to North K@@ o@@ re@@ an products .
F@@ e@@ a@@ si@@ bility st@@ u@@ di@@ es will be con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted in those areas re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as having priority .
the European Union will make efforts to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the political con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tions with the R@@ e@@ public of Korea , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e efforts to effect a ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between the two K@@ o@@ re@@ an States are fully su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by the European Union .
it is also a question of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing areas in which j@@ o@@ in@@ t measures might be taken , for example on the issue of technical aid and economic cooperation with the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea .
Madam President , I very much welcome the opportunity of sa@@ ying a few words on this extremely important subject .
recent e@@ v@@ ents on the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a are of great interest and concern to all of us in Europe and the contribution that we make in h@@ el@@ p@@ ing to promote re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation on the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a , in h@@ el@@ p@@ ing to bring , as it were , the North K@@ o@@ re@@ an government and society in out of the c@@ ol@@ d .
those efforts re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t the ex@@ t@@ ent to which Europe has a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al role to pla@@ y and they ma@@ t@@ ch , in a s@@ en@@ se , the role that J@@ ap@@ an has been pla@@ ying the Balkans - h@@ el@@ p@@ ing to support st@@ ability there .
we si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly have res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in other con@@ t@@ in@@ ents .
a European Union approach towards recent de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a was agreed at the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs C@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ il@@ s of 9 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and 20 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er last year .
this approach a@@ im@@ s , as I have said , to support the in@@ ter @-@ K@@ o@@ re@@ an re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation process in order to bring about peace and st@@ ability on the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a .
taking this approach as the basis for Commission action , the Commission will ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in and is con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing its assistance to North Korea .
over@@ all , in the last few years , that assistance has to@@ t@@ al@@ l@@ ed - including the contribution to the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation - about EUR 2@@ 7@@ 5@@ m .
however , any in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ s should be m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to si@@ g@@ n@@ s of progress of the D@@ P@@ R@@ K in areas of pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al concern to us and , I know , to Members of this House .
respect , for example , for human rights ; non @-@ pr@@ ol@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ ation issues ; access for the population to external aid ; better op@@ er@@ ating conditions for N@@ G@@ O@@ s - a point I was able to make to the D@@ P@@ R@@ K F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister in B@@ an@@ g@@ k@@ o@@ k last su@@ m@@ m@@ er - and the op@@ en@@ ing up of the D@@ P@@ R@@ K &apos;s ec@@ on@@ om@@ y and the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l reform that will be a necessary part of that .
this approach has been ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed to the North K@@ o@@ re@@ an authorities at the recent S@@ en@@ i@@ or O@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als T@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a meeting in P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g at the end of N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er .
I understand that my services are k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing Parliament fully in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of this issue .
Parliament has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n an ac@@ tive interest in this subject for some time .
the h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an and food assistance d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red to the D@@ P@@ R@@ K - ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d EUR 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ m since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 3 - will continue .
a new food security programme for 2000 , to@@ t@@ al@@ l@@ ing EUR 2@@ 0@@ m , has just been adopted by the Commission .
I should point out that we have mo@@ v@@ ed from re@@ gu@@ la@@ r food aid to st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l food assistance and , in particular , the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of in@@ pu@@ ts and technical assistance to en@@ h@@ an@@ ce agricultural production .
the implementation of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an projects ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed in the year 2000 will ex@@ t@@ en@@ d well into the su@@ m@@ m@@ er of this year .
h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid - ma@@ in@@ ly m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es , w@@ a@@ ter , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation and w@@ in@@ ter c@@ l@@ o@@ th@@ es - is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed to continue on a more s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive basis , but at a level a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to real h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an needs .
we also have the sc@@ op@@ e to ma@@ t@@ ch , with ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al assistance , any further progress made by the D@@ P@@ R@@ K authorities , no@@ ta@@ b@@ ly in terms of access to the most v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions and the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of working conditions for non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l organisations .
in addition , the Commission is now con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing possible measures in the fi@@ el@@ ds of technical assistance and trade , which could be gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded if North Korea makes progress in the areas I have mentioned .
as a first st@@ e@@ p , these measures in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a general increase in the D@@ P@@ R@@ K te@@ x@@ ti@@ le qu@@ o@@ t@@ a by 6@@ 0 % , 5@@ 0 % in the case of a few pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies .
a fact @-@ fin@@ ding ex@@ per@@ t mis@@ sion will be s@@ ent sh@@ or@@ tly to as@@ se@@ s@@ s needs and i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy areas in which p@@ il@@ o@@ t technical assistance projects could be pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed .
but they certainly in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de an area which , I know , has been of interest to Mr F@@ or@@ d - that is the whole question of the energy in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es in North Korea which will be so important to the country &apos;s economic future .
as to the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations between the European Community and the D@@ P@@ R@@ K , the Commission is con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing the appropriate ti@@ m@@ ing of such a st@@ e@@ p in c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation with Member States .
finally , clearly the N@@ o@@ be@@ l p@@ ri@@ z@@ e @-@ w@@ in@@ n@@ er , President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e @-@ J@@ un@@ g , has been t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally v@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ ary in the efforts that he has made to promote re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation on the pen@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a .
e@@ qu@@ ally clearly , President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e @-@ J@@ un@@ g has been very re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c about what can be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in the sh@@ or@@ t term .
I do not think he makes ex@@ tra@@ va@@ g@@ ant c@@ la@@ im@@ s about the pa@@ ce and development .
what is important is to k@@ e@@ e@@ p our e@@ y@@ es on the h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on and to k@@ e@@ e@@ p working towards it .
we should take our in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion from President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e @-@ J@@ un@@ g , who is one of the great st@@ a@@ te@@ s@@ men of our age .
I hope that with his en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement the European Union will continue to pla@@ y its part in en@@ sur@@ ing that the K@@ o@@ re@@ an P@@ en@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a , the region and , indeed , the world , en@@ j@@ o@@ y peace and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
the consequences if we were to continue to is@@ ol@@ ate the D@@ P@@ R@@ K , if the D@@ P@@ R@@ K was to continue to be pre@@ pa@@ red to be is@@ ol@@ ated , are too g@@ ri@@ m to con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late .
Madam President , the resolution on North Korea , on which Parliament is about to vote , has a political si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of the first w@@ a@@ ter .
not only will the European Parliament itself establish its position on the n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n h@@ al@@ f of the K@@ o@@ re@@ an pen@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a , but it will also have defin@@ ed the new di@@ rec@@ tion of this position for all the European institutions .
in my c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity as p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the a@@ d h@@ o@@ c d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e v@@ is@@ it to North Korea in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ red the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting of this resolution , I should like to share three key con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations with you .
the first is the ad@@ v@@ ent of a new er@@ a in b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l relations between the two K@@ o@@ re@@ as , ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised by the policy of ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement , or S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , of President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e J@@ un@@ g , who made an important in@@ it@@ i@@ al g@@ e@@ st@@ ur@@ e with his h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic v@@ is@@ it in J@@ un@@ e 2000 to P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g .
Europe has a d@@ u@@ ty to support the efforts of the K@@ o@@ re@@ an people as a whole and the K@@ o@@ re@@ an political le@@ ad@@ ers with a view to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing st@@ ability and la@@ st@@ ing peace in Korea .
this is the context in which our policy on Korea must be v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed and the sc@@ op@@ e of our policy actions must be defin@@ ed .
secondly , Korea is the last n@@ ation in the world that is still di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by a w@@ all .
following the example of G@@ er@@ many and Y@@ em@@ en , Korea can now be@@ g@@ in to see the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of cooperation with a view to over@@ com@@ ing this internal frontier .
Europe , which the two K@@ o@@ re@@ an st@@ a@@ tes have as@@ k@@ ed to as@@ s@@ is@@ t them in defin@@ ing new economic and political relations within Korea , must accept the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge and point the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans towards the p@@ at@@ h to in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion after a long and difficult time as a di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed n@@ ation .
the European example of the gra@@ d@@ u@@ al c@@ re@@ ation of area without internal f@@ r@@ on@@ ti@@ ers is being called upon to s@@ er@@ ve as an example in this in@@ st@@ ance .
once again we have a political responsibility to provide every con@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ va@@ ble aid to a Korea which is s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly over@@ com@@ ing its h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e .
finally , I would like to te@@ l@@ l you that , more s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds North Korea , con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ta@@ tion and is@@ ol@@ ation must be con@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to the past once and for all .
the North K@@ o@@ re@@ an le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p se@@ em@@ s w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to be open and to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e dialogue with S@@ ou@@ th Korea , the United States , Europe and J@@ ap@@ an , and although , in the fin@@ al an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , they must be j@@ u@@ d@@ ged on their actions , I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that a European policy of dialogue , st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red and c@@ r@@ it@@ ical dialogue , will make a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant contribution to ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea that will b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e world .
Madam President , can I say we have made en@@ or@@ m@@ ous progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the D@@ P@@ R@@ K .
we have now had three in@@ ter@@ par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s and the resolution c@@ al@@ l@@ s for the K@@ o@@ re@@ ans to come here again to continue the dialogue .
we have seen the European Commission mo@@ ve from not t@@ al@@ king to the North K@@ o@@ re@@ ans to having an E@@ C@@ H@@ O re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive in P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g and we have now mo@@ v@@ ed from fi@@ ve Member States with di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations to , I understand , th@@ ir@@ te@@ en in the process of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with the D@@ P@@ R@@ K .
I would like very much to see the European Community also establish di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with the D@@ P@@ R@@ K .
we give money to the K@@ E@@ D@@ O pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t as Mr P@@ att@@ en has said , we give h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an and food aid and are h@@ op@@ ing to give other st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l assistance , a to@@ ta@@ l of EUR 2@@ 7@@ 5 m .
it is c@@ ra@@ z@@ y to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue .
we need a dialogue on human rights , we need a dialogue on w@@ e@@ ap@@ on s@@ al@@ es , we need a dialogue on economic development .
the re@@ al@@ ity is that with the c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se of the S@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ t em@@ p@@ ir@@ e , the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to make the trans@@ ition from the S@@ ta@@ k@@ h@@ an@@ o@@ v@@ ite he@@ a@@ v@@ y in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es of the past to the new li@@ g@@ h@@ t in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es and a s@@ er@@ ies of natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers , the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y is in com@@ p@@ le@@ te crisis .
ob@@ s@@ er@@ ver@@ s are e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ting that the re@@ su@@ l@@ ting food crisis has led to the pre@@ ma@@ ture de@@ a@@ th@@ s of 3 million North K@@ o@@ re@@ ans , one in e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of the population .
today their only ex@@ por@@ ts are ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als and military h@@ ar@@ d@@ w@@ are .
if we can find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , we can help the people of the D@@ P@@ R@@ K to help themselves with food aid and assistance in re@@ st@@ ar@@ ting and re@@ b@@ u@@ il@@ ding ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , min@@ ing and non @-@ n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r energy projects .
and if we in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve ourselves in re@@ mo@@ v@@ ing the im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to ex@@ por@@ t military ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al then we may force the in@@ com@@ ing B@@ u@@ s@@ h ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion to re@@ consider its ap@@ par@@ ent b@@ l@@ in@@ d commitment to national mis@@ si@@ le de@@ f@@ ence with the th@@ re@@ at to world peace and st@@ ability that p@@ o@@ ses .
I would like to congratulate President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e @-@ J@@ un@@ g of the R@@ e@@ public of Korea on his commitment to the su@@ n@@ sh@@ ine policy which will allow the n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ is@@ ation of in@@ ter @-@ K@@ o@@ re@@ an relations and welcome K@@ i@@ m J@@ on@@ g I@@ l &apos;s positive res@@ p@@ on@@ se .
dialogue is the way forward .
Europe should pu@@ r@@ su@@ e this not only because it is currently the policy of the R@@ e@@ public of Korea but because it is the right way to go .
our ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge is that we are not J@@ ap@@ an or the United States and we can ac@@ t as h@@ on@@ est b@@ ro@@ k@@ ers in this most d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous area of the world .
Mr President , it would ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r that the h@@ op@@ es raised by the J@@ un@@ e S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it between the two K@@ im@@ s from North and S@@ ou@@ th Korea are not going to be f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed . the op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is f@@ ad@@ ing .
North Korea is fin@@ ding it difficult to make good those few , l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y s@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ ic com@@ m@@ it@@ ments it made in the military field , it is d@@ el@@ a@@ ying the re@@ uni@@ fication of f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies who were se@@ par@@ ated by the war and have re@@ ma@@ in@@ ed so for 5@@ 0 years and it is s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing no si@@ g@@ n of in@@ t@@ en@@ ding to make the re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n v@@ is@@ it of K@@ i@@ m J@@ on@@ g I@@ l to S@@ e@@ ou@@ l , pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed for s@@ pr@@ ing this year , a p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al re@@ al@@ ity , and it is not yet k@@ no@@ w@@ n when or whether this will take place .
President C@@ l@@ in@@ t@@ on &apos;s decision not to go to North Korea , even though he w@@ an@@ ted to in order to fin@@ ish his presidency with a h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic v@@ is@@ it , could now mean a long pa@@ use in Korea &apos;s process of op@@ en@@ ing up to the ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e world .
in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of this , I he@@ a@@ r t@@ on@@ es of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and I see European countries qu@@ e@@ u@@ ing up - Mr B@@ ro@@ k t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed on the issue just now - and f@@ al@@ l@@ ing over themselves in the r@@ u@@ s@@ h to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the S@@ t@@ al@@ in@@ is@@ t P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g re@@ g@@ im@@ e , t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing a b@@ l@@ in@@ d e@@ y@@ e to what g@@ o@@ es on in the country , to the tra@@ g@@ i@@ c v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights .
therefore , I say : y@@ es , certainly , let us encourage ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between the two K@@ o@@ re@@ as ; of course we must provide assistance for the North K@@ o@@ re@@ ans to sa@@ ve them from st@@ ar@@ v@@ ing to death - Mr F@@ or@@ d mentioned this just now - but , at the same time , we must la@@ y down st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent conditions to ensure that the aid re@@ ac@@ h@@ es the pla@@ c@@ es where it is g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed and does not s@@ er@@ ve to support a par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d , un@@ pre@@ d@@ ic@@ ta@@ ble re@@ g@@ im@@ e which is w@@ on@@ t to res@@ or@@ t to the th@@ re@@ at of mis@@ si@@ l@@ es and n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r ar@@ m@@ s to ensure its sur@@ v@@ i@@ va@@ l .
Madam President , I should like to thank the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members for the v@@ al@@ u@@ able in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions that have been made in this discussion on the important issue of the European Union &apos; s re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea .
allow me just to make a few b@@ ri@@ e@@ f con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ding re@@ mar@@ ks .
it is gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that an agreement has now been made within the European Union to make a better at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate the issue of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with the D@@ P@@ R@@ K .
a number of EU Member States , including my own country , have had di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea the whole time . others have rec@@ ently dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to establish relations , while a further group is w@@ a@@ it@@ ing to take a decision on e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing relations .
I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally believe that a di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c p@@ res@@ ence is of great importance .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago , I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f had the opportunity to s@@ er@@ ve in P@@ y@@ on@@ g@@ y@@ an@@ g and know what it means to be con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted di@@ rec@@ tly with the re@@ al@@ ity of that country .
I would also re@@ mind you of the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment made by S@@ ou@@ th Korea &apos; s President K@@ i@@ m D@@ a@@ e Y@@ ou@@ n@@ g on his v@@ is@@ it to S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing the N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ e@@ ac@@ e P@@ ri@@ z@@ e in O@@ s@@ l@@ o .
he made a public ap@@ p@@ e@@ al at that time for a more important role for the European Union where the situation on the K@@ o@@ re@@ an pen@@ in@@ su@@ l@@ a is concerned .
I believe we must take his ap@@ p@@ e@@ al s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
we should be pre@@ pa@@ red also to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of ap@@ p@@ e@@ al when the time is right .
it is important for us to agree within the European Union about what we are to do when we adopt a position on such measures .
we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to have an agreed view on to what ex@@ t@@ ent there are re@@ as@@ on@@ able opportunities of making progress in what we are doing , and it is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly also important for conditions in the D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of Korea to be such that it makes s@@ en@@ se to do something .
thank you , Minister .
I must in@@ for@@ m you that I have received a motion for a resolution under R@@ u@@ le 4@@ 2 ( 5 ) of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
I pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ing the s@@ it@@ ting .
we shall re@@ su@@ me at no@@ on for the v@@ o@@ ting .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed at 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 4@@ 5 a@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 1@@ 2 no@@ on )
vote
Mr President , our group , as you know , did not vote for the S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t report in committee .
we would support it here , however , if A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 5 and 6 were adopted .
we have dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed this with the other groups .
in the case of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 , I am in@@ for@@ m@@ ed that other groups would be able to support the amendment if two l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ti@@ c al@@ te@@ ra@@ tions were made .
the first is the re@@ pla@@ c@@ ement of the wor@@ d &apos; re@@ view &apos; by the wor@@ d &apos; ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation &apos; as the E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h trans@@ la@@ tion of the G@@ er@@ m@@ an Ü@@ b@@ er@@ pr@@ ü@@ f@@ un@@ g ; this is only a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ti@@ c ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment .
the second , however , would be an or@@ al amendment .
we ask that the wor@@ d R@@ ec@@ h@@ t@@ s@@ si@@ ch@@ er@@ he@@ it in the G@@ er@@ m@@ an ver@@ sion of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 be re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by the wor@@ d K@@ l@@ ar@@ he@@ it and that the E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h term &apos; legal c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y &apos; be acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by the wor@@ d &apos; c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication &apos; .
may I ask you to no@@ te this or@@ al amendment and to put the ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ed ver@@ sion of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 to the vote .
Mr President , I am pre@@ pa@@ red to support those amendments that have just been proposed concerning A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 , because the proposal including these ch@@ an@@ g@@ es is si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly better than the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al ver@@ sion .
I would therefore encourage M@@ E@@ P@@ s to ap@@ pro@@ ve the or@@ al amendments which Mr L@@ i@@ e@@ s@@ e tabled from the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party .

Mr President , it has been agreed with the rapporteur , Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en , that when it comes to A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 2 of P@@ ar@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 6 , we should regard this amendment as an addition to the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h .
this means , therefore , that if A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 2 is ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed , the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h will also have to be put to the vote .

I am in to@@ ta@@ l agreement with the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive and its objectives in terms of pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting the en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ e@@ red ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding natural heritage of the countries of the European Union .
this heritage and its b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical and g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity are the pl@@ an@@ e@@ t &apos; s most pre@@ c@@ i@@ ous as@@ se@@ ts and we must indeed ensure that they are pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted , re@@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed and h@@ an@@ ded down to future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations .
even so , I voted against the S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t report for two c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al reasons .
firstly , it is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to b@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ ma@@ i@@ l European ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to our countries by making them con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al , in ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 1 , upon com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive as it st@@ an@@ ds .
if it were simply a matter of en@@ sur@@ ing that European funds are not used to fin@@ ance projects d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ ying these ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding ec@@ o@@ s@@ y@@ st@@ em@@ s , then I should have en@@ d@@ or@@ sed the resolution and voted in favour of it , but it is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble and un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted to make a European Union policy con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al upon com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with another and that social conditions should be subject , for example , to environmental conditions .
my second reason is that the resolution does not c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of &quot; dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ance &quot; and the legal discussion , which is so d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly va@@ gu@@ e that legal b@@ att@@ l@@ es could be re@@ v@@ i@@ v@@ ed , which might le@@ a@@ d to b@@ ans on tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al h@@ un@@ ts where these are a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ised under the B@@ ir@@ ds D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive and the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ary law in the st@@ a@@ tes .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because the European Union d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ s this a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ gu@@ ity that some countries ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence problems in is@@ su@@ ing their &quot; N@@ a@@ ture 2000 &quot; l@@ is@@ t@@ s and in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive c@@ al@@ m@@ ly , without res@@ is@@ t@@ ance on the part of the farmers in those countries , even though everyone ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ es the no@@ ble nature of the objectives of the directive .
C@@ un@@ h@@ a report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 6@@ 7 / 2000 )
Mr President , last su@@ m@@ m@@ er I w@@ ent on h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y to G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u , and , as is my w@@ on@@ t , I ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed a few words with one of the local el@@ d@@ er@@ ly pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers , or rather with a f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ m@@ an from G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u would have de@@ ar@@ ly l@@ o@@ v@@ ed to have become a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er .
having been t@@ ol@@ d that I am the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party , he com@@ pla@@ in@@ ed to me : &quot; I go out to se@@ a to f@@ ish , I work w@@ h@@ en@@ ever it is possible and I would like to work many d@@ a@@ y@@ s so that I can have a pen@@ sion as well .
however , unfortunately , because our se@@ a is f@@ is@@ h@@ ed by European Union fishing bo@@ at@@ s , I cannot find enough work to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to a pen@@ sion , and I do not see an@@ y@@ th@@ ing of the European Union fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to the Government of G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u for the Government does not give me an@@ y@@ th@@ ing at all . &quot;
I therefore voted for the report , but on con@@ d@@ ition that things improve in future .
this report and its amendments deal with financial support to G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a @-@ B@@ is@@ sa@@ u in the fisheries sector .
despite our many res@@ er@@ va@@ tions , we voted in favour of them out of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with the people of that country , especially its f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men .
firstly , because the objective of the fisheries ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents between the European Union and third countries are , as is ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly st@@ a@@ ted in some other reports , in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to s@@ par@@ e European Union fisheries resources and , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , to increase c@@ at@@ ch@@ es from the w@@ a@@ ters of other countries .
next , because we do not know ex@@ ac@@ tly how this aid will be used and what its p@@ rec@@ ise ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te d@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ ation will be .
unfortunately , however , too much of this aid is often nothing more than a de f@@ ac@@ to re@@ b@@ ate g@@ r@@ an@@ ted to the European com@@ p@@ an@@ ies in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing in these countries .
mo@@ re@@ over , such aid is often also mis@@ ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ated by the local ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion .
despite all that , at the end of the day , this money , which is su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the local people , will , even so , be better em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed over there than the money given to major em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ers over here who are sh@@ ed@@ ding j@@ o@@ b@@ s .

sa@@ d@@ ly , Mr President , the people of Bangladesh are so b@@ ad@@ ly o@@ f@@ f that they do not even know the m@@ e@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d &quot; pen@@ sion . &quot;
so I said to m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f : &quot; when the V@@ an d@@ en B@@ o@@ s d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment is put to the vote , re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er to vote for the motion , F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o , but also re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to m@@ on@@ it@@ or the t@@ r@@ an@@ sa@@ c@@ tion and ensure that the aid given to the people of Bangladesh through this agreement also s@@ er@@ v@@ es to provide a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er or two with a State pen@@ sion . &quot;
the Committee on D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment and C@@ o@@ op@@ er@@ ation w@@ el@@ comes the fact that the ra@@ te of g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of Bangladesh &apos; s ex@@ por@@ t industry is th@@ r@@ ice that of the country &apos; s d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic production .
these ex@@ por@@ ts , however , are al@@ most ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y the work of the major com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , mo@@ st@@ ly W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n , which have set up f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies in this country .
while there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that these f@@ ir@@ m@@ s are g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing r@@ ic@@ h by ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ing the under@@ pa@@ i@@ d workers of this country , including children , this is not about to en@@ able Bangladesh to em@@ er@@ ge from its under@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed state or to en@@ able its working population to e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ e p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
the report c@@ al@@ l@@ s for an increase in &quot; the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the p@@ ri@@ va@@ te sector &quot; on world mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
this is a clear in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation of who it h@@ op@@ es to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from the el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of the &quot; infrastructure bo@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ ks &quot; , especially &quot; transport and energy infrastructure &quot; , as well as making &quot; the financial system e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent &quot; , or en@@ sur@@ ing &quot; a trans@@ par@@ ent and ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ ble in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al environment &quot; , a e@@ u@@ p@@ h@@ em@@ is@@ m for taking action to pen@@ al@@ ise an@@ y@@ one who , in the w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion , u@@ p@@ se@@ ts the W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ or@@ s .
in these c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , the proposal to re@@ le@@ a@@ se European funds is ch@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ ly ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted at su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the sh@@ or@@ t@@ f@@ al@@ l@@ s of the B@@ an@@ g@@ la@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ i State and at having the European institutions be@@ a@@ r the costs of the development of infrastructure that the large cor@@ por@@ ations need in order to en@@ able them to d@@ er@@ i@@ ve most prof@@ it from one of the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es in the world .
Mr President , I certainly voted against A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 9 about c@@ re@@ ating a European ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity .
I n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s voted in favour of the report as a whole because I think it good that the European Parliament should once again make it clear that the EU ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to give priority to non @-@ military crisis management measures .
that is an important ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion that cannot be re@@ p@@ e@@ ated often enough .
against that b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d , I no@@ te that the j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fication , in any case , re@@ f@@ ers to the European Parliament &apos; s un@@ an@@ im@@ ous re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to establish a civil peace cor@@ p@@ s .
I think it is good for that to be re@@ p@@ e@@ ated .
that too cannot be re@@ p@@ e@@ ated often enough .
unfortunately , the countries h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency - F@@ in@@ land , P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and F@@ r@@ an@@ ce - ch@@ o@@ s@@ e not to pa@@ y any attention to the European Parliament &apos; s un@@ an@@ im@@ ous re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation .
against that b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d , I think that the Swedish Presidency has a b@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant opportunity to take the initiative .
I have on a number of o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons had o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion to su@@ g@@ g@@ est this di@@ rec@@ tly to F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister L@@ in@@ d@@ h and P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on .
unfortunately , however , it would ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r that the Swedish Government has not pro@@ per@@ ly under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d what is m@@ e@@ ant by a civil peace cor@@ p@@ s but b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that other measures under way are the same as a civil peace cor@@ p@@ s .
it is un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate that it does not want to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the report pro@@ per@@ ly and that it does not respect the European Parliament &apos;s point of view by at least doing something .
I hope that this is a mis@@ under@@ st@@ an@@ ding between m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f and the Swedish Government .
in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of our having dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed this many ti@@ m@@ es , mis@@ under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s may of course ar@@ ise .
I therefore wish to take the opportunity to ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge the Swedish Government once again .
now that Sweden has the Presidency of the Council , it should , if it is serious about the EU &apos; s not b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing a military su@@ per@@ power but a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r for peace , im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly ensure that an initiative is taken in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the European Parliament &apos; s re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for a civil peace cor@@ p@@ s .
Mr President , what is the R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m ?
I as@@ k@@ ed m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f this question when , upon my ar@@ ri@@ va@@ l in h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al to have my f@@ o@@ o@@ t put in pla@@ st@@ er , I sa@@ w some d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s k@@ no@@ c@@ king a small ha@@ m@@ m@@ er against the k@@ n@@ e@@ e of a pa@@ ti@@ ent , which im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly j@@ er@@ k@@ ed u@@ p@@ w@@ ar@@ ds .
but then , as I ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing &apos;s d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , I re@@ al@@ is@@ ed that the R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m is a major financial initiative which will make it possible for Europe to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ tly and im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly in order to take peace to pla@@ c@@ es where peace is under th@@ re@@ at .
this is a com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ able un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king , and I therefore voted for the report , but I fe@@ a@@ r that it may be too a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous for us to implement since we do not yet have a g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y un@@ ited Europe .
- ( D@@ A ) W@@ e have voted in favour of the report because the in@@ t@@ en@@ tions be@@ h@@ in@@ d non @-@ military crisis management are s@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
at the same time , however , we would em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that it is in practice im@@ possible to se@@ par@@ ate de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble civil in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion from un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble military in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
mo@@ re@@ over , we call upon initiatives to be carried out through international organisations such as the UN , the Council of Europe or the O@@ S@@ C@@ E .
.
( F@@ R ) G@@ i@@ v@@ en that ra@@ p@@ i@@ d p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion is , like war , the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s by other means , and in view of the fact that we have no more con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in European Union policy than we do in that of Member States , we are op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to any form of military or p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion by the European Union , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er it may be .
the report g@@ i@@ v@@ es the Balkans as an example , but an &quot; in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent &quot; European p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion force would be no better than that pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed under the a@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ es of the United N@@ ations , or the United States , in other words .
at the most , it would support the position in the region held by the major European in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al groups that are c@@ a@@ st@@ ing co@@ v@@ et@@ ous g@@ l@@ an@@ c@@ es at the market for the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of what the NATO b@@ om@@ b@@ ers d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
indeed , the ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed wish that &quot; the R@@ R@@ F will have no g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical l@@ im@@ it@@ ation &quot; f@@ o@@ res@@ ha@@ d@@ o@@ ws ac@@ ts of p@@ i@@ ra@@ c@@ y to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it the for@@ m@@ er c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a or el@@ se@@ where , like those that F@@ r@@ an@@ ce has com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in the past to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t d@@ ic@@ ta@@ t@@ or@@ s from the op@@ position of their p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es , or like those that G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in is com@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ing at this very moment in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one .
we therefore voted against the c@@ re@@ ation of the R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity , just as we shall vote against any b@@ u@@ d@@ get al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ations to support it .
we must welcome the fact that the Council proposal f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws on di@@ rec@@ tly from the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the C@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ e , H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i and F@@ e@@ ir@@ a European C@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ il@@ s which ur@@ g@@ ed the Union to &quot; improve and make more effective use of resources in c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an crisis management . &quot;
the European Union has va@@ st ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence and the resources necessary to set up , at very sh@@ or@@ t no@@ ti@@ ce , op@@ er@@ ations such as the monitoring of el@@ ec@@ tions , b@@ order control , p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force training and ou@@ t@@ f@@ it@@ t@@ ing .
this p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al must be ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited to the full , especially as the Union has not been c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of re@@ ac@@ ting qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly enough and the in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments for funding op@@ er@@ ations of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e were not f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble enough .
the European Commission does not provide for any &quot; g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical l@@ im@@ it@@ ation &quot; to the R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity ( R@@ R@@ F ) .
it does , however , st@@ i@@ pu@@ late that the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions must have a &quot; sh@@ or@@ t life s@@ p@@ an &quot; .
if e@@ v@@ ents call for more long @-@ term in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , then the resources currently available , such as the th@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c programmes , should be used .
under the M@@ E@@ D@@ A P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me , by way of example , the R@@ R@@ F will be used in particular for the training of im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion s@@ er@@ v@@ ice o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als and cooperation in com@@ b@@ ating ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m .
.
of course , the b@@ ra@@ in@@ s be@@ h@@ in@@ d the te@@ x@@ t do not con@@ c@@ e@@ al their in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to su@@ p@@ pl@@ ement the proposed measures with the European P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity F@@ or@@ ce ( ar@@ m@@ ed ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ) which can be de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in &quot; law and order op@@ er@@ ations . &quot;
t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally enough , the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs ou@@ t@@ does the Commission with its amendments ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ing the EUR 1@@ 2 million c@@ e@@ il@@ ing on each in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , the C@@ r@@ is@@ is Committee and the n@@ ine @-@ m@@ on@@ th l@@ im@@ it on each in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
the M@@ E@@ P@@ s of the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e will n@@ e@@ v@@ er c@@ e@@ a@@ se to con@@ d@@ em@@ n this EU policy , which a@@ im@@ s to make third countries p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally and ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic@@ ally de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent and su@@ p@@ p@@ res@@ s the gra@@ s@@ s @-@ ro@@ o@@ t@@ s movement .
not only are we op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to any form of im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t ra@@ p@@ i@@ d or even s@@ l@@ o@@ w re@@ action f@@ ac@@ il@@ ity , we shall do e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing within our power to un@@ ite all the people in these countries against any im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t pl@@ ans to su@@ b@@ j@@ u@@ g@@ ate them and to c@@ la@@ i@@ m the place which they d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve in a new , f@@ a@@ i@@ r , international order .
in dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing to c@@ re@@ ate the cor@@ e of a European ar@@ my , the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it has op@@ en@@ ed a new c@@ ha@@ p@@ ter in the h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y of the European Union .
for t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years , it has been at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to w@@ in p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r b@@ ac@@ king by c@@ la@@ im@@ ing to be b@@ u@@ il@@ ding a social Europe .
f@@ ac@@ ed with f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e , following the B@@ al@@ k@@ an conflict , it has had a change of he@@ ar@@ t .
it now op@@ en@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its that its objective is the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a European su@@ per@@ power that will de@@ f@@ end European interests &quot; all over the world &quot; .
the im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t nature of this is pla@@ in to see .
it will do so in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with the United States within NATO .
in future , by co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating its di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c and military for@@ c@@ es , the EU will be t@@ r@@ ying to op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e what its Member States have done in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ ally throughout the last c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
this is to be carried out in the n@@ a@@ me of &quot; ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing &quot; or &quot; im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing &quot; peace , and &quot; h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an op@@ er@@ ations &quot; .
both within and ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e NATO , which is d@@ om@@ in@@ ated by the United States , the EU is at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to &apos; s@@ el@@ l &apos; us on its s@@ ch@@ em@@ e in the n@@ a@@ me of Europe &apos; s &quot; in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence &quot; v@@ is @-@ à @-@ v@@ is the United States . we do not need this E@@ ur@@ o @-@ m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ m .
we are just as ra@@ d@@ ic@@ ally op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to this European ar@@ my as we were to the NATO ar@@ my , as the first effect will be a d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c increase in the military b@@ u@@ d@@ get , which will in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly go hand in hand with he@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ en@@ ed m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ ti@@ c pro@@ pa@@ g@@ an@@ d@@ a .
s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch will be si@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ ed o@@ f@@ f into the military sector .
it will trans@@ f@@ er an in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d share of the state b@@ u@@ d@@ get to b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses in that sector , with the g@@ o@@ al of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a European military industry ( E@@ A@@ D@@ S , D@@ as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t , B@@ A@@ E ) c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing the better of the United States .
the workers have nothing to g@@ a@@ in and e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing to l@@ o@@ s@@ e in the EU &apos; s &quot; new &quot; im@@ per@@ i@@ al de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ s .
.
( it ) T@@ here is clearly no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that it would be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly appropriate to c@@ re@@ ate a R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity and , mo@@ re@@ over , the three Community institutions have already ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed positive v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
however , over and above our common g@@ o@@ al , we feel that certain el@@ em@@ ents of the Council &apos;s proposal d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve c@@ a@@ re@@ ful con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
the first is e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally th@@ e@@ o@@ re@@ ti@@ c@@ al : the objectives of the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m in question do not ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be very clear , a@@ part from the ta@@ s@@ ks of su@@ pr@@ an@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al p@@ ol@@ ic@@ ing .
the rapporteur g@@ o@@ es so far as to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a European P@@ ol@@ ice F@@ or@@ ce .
and if this were the case we could consider the proposal , but it would have to have a different legal basis and , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , a different Community in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al system from that defin@@ ed by the recent In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it at Nice .
in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , in our opinion , the ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of the R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m is to make Community policies and programmes effective more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in that e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s more con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently .
mo@@ re@@ over , the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al im@@ p@@ res@@ sion c@@ a@@ me from the d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ tion of the conditions for t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ ing the F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity , which , being very general , still does not give a p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al idea of them , when it would have been enough , without pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ice to the n@@ or@@ ma@@ l in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion conditions la@@ i@@ d down by Community re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t those conditions which , on the basis of their ur@@ g@@ ency , t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er the R@@ e@@ action M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
then , it ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s st@@ r@@ an@@ ge that the governments of the States within which the M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m may be t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ red are not a@@ m@@ on@@ g the parties no@@ ti@@ fied of the t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er@@ ing of the M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
mo@@ re@@ over , it se@@ em@@ s od@@ d that they are not no@@ ti@@ fied , since they have been ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted by policies and programmes which , in the case in point , need to be sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ded .
finally , ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions could be raised to the increase in the v@@ ol@@ u@@ me of information s@@ ent to the European Parliament , even through the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure al@@ one , but , since we hope that the l@@ is@@ t of to@@ p@@ ic@@ s subject to c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on will be ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded , we feel that , in specific cases of g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical or political importance , the Commission must not h@@ ol@@ d back from in@@ for@@ m@@ ing Parliament .
in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of these con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations , we support the ch@@ an@@ g@@ es proposed by the rapporteur and we have therefore voted for the motion .
.
for the past e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ te@@ en m@@ on@@ th@@ s , B@@ r@@ it@@ ish C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ v@@ es have been c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for the Commission to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent financial management and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures so that it can d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er external assistance and implement programmes , such as min@@ e action , ur@@ g@@ ently in time of crisis or when li@@ v@@ es are at st@@ a@@ k@@ e .
they support proposals with these objectives in mind and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a R@@ ap@@ i@@ d R@@ e@@ action F@@ ac@@ il@@ ity ( or M@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m ) , in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of its con@@ f@@ using t@@ it@@ le and some un@@ n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally @-@ cor@@ rec@@ t el@@ em@@ ents .
their f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion is to the amendments which se@@ e@@ k to use this proposal as a v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le for e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a &quot; European P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity F@@ or@@ ce . &quot;
this con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t , for some s@@ or@@ t of European g@@ en@@ d@@ ar@@ m@@ er@@ i@@ e , has far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion .
we were pre@@ pa@@ red to support the Commission proposal if it did not con@@ ta@@ in these amendments ( 9 or 3@@ 9 ) but ab@@ st@@ a@@ in if they were in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded .
O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 8 / 2000 )
Mr President , as re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party , how could I not speak on this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , which la@@ y@@ s down how the pen@@ si@@ ons and health c@@ are of frontier and other workers , who work in different regions from those in which they li@@ ve and work at other ti@@ m@@ es of their li@@ v@@ es , should be re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted .
a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er from the b@@ order between I@@ t@@ al@@ y and S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , which is par@@ ty to these ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , as@@ k@@ ed me whether it was t@@ r@@ u@@ e that the pen@@ si@@ ons of people who work in other States of the European Union had been raised .
&quot; if only they had ! &quot; I re@@ p@@ li@@ ed .
&quot; I would be very ha@@ p@@ p@@ y , and so would you , for you would be able to find much more , much better work in the other European States .
in any case , I will ra@@ ise the issue when I give my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote on the O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en report , which de@@ als with this subject . &quot;
- ( D@@ A ) T@@ he L@@ e@@ f@@ t par@@ ty at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es importance to re@@ mo@@ v@@ ing ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es to the free movement of la@@ b@@ our .
we have therefore su@@ p@@ por@@ ted this own @-@ initiative report which pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses greater efforts to com@@ b@@ at the problems c@@ re@@ ated by di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in social and f@@ is@@ c@@ al systems .
however , we are not in favour of pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a directive ob@@ li@@ g@@ ing the Member States to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the impact of new legislation on frontier workers .
- ( D@@ A ) T@@ he D@@ an@@ ish S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts have today voted in favour of Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en &apos; s report on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union .
we have done so because this report h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts the many serious problems f@@ ac@@ ed by frontier workers .
a large pro@@ por@@ tion of these problems can be s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed if the Council d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes a c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity for action .
in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity v@@ o@@ ting in this area at the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence in Nice , we want to use our vote today to s@@ en@@ d a p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful si@@ g@@ n@@ al to the Council and call upon them to com@@ p@@ le@@ te a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ going re@@ view and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion No 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 .
we believe that the rules for co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation must be si@@ m@@ p@@ le and e@@ as@@ y to ad@@ min@@ is@@ ter . we cannot therefore support a new directive which ad@@ ds new procedures to R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion No 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 .
in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the debate , we have em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed that we cannot support the re@@ mar@@ ks in the report concerning the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of social security ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents through ta@@ x@@ ation .
in addition , we want to st@@ res@@ s that we do not consider , either , that health b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its such as m@@ ed@@ ical t@@ re@@ at@@ ment can be com@@ pa@@ red with general services , and that responsibility for this area must continue s@@ ol@@ el@@ y to be the responsibility of the Member States .
for the most part , this report con@@ fin@@ es itself to general con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations without pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing forward any p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al decisions .
even when it does put forward a positive m@@ e@@ a@@ sure such as &quot; proposals to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d access by de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent family members of frontier workers , re@@ ti@@ red frontier workers and de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent members of their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies to health c@@ are pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons and b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its &quot; , the Council is as@@ k@@ ed only &quot; with all possible ex@@ p@@ ed@@ ition to adopt a position &quot; .
while we support this request , we ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ed from the vote on the report .
all the workers of the European Union ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from the same social protection , with each of the com@@ p@@ on@@ ent areas ( social security , re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pen@@ si@@ ons , family b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its ) st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es of the country where they are most f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble to workers .
in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , in order to improve the situation of frontier workers , they and their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies should be able to c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e , in each of these areas , between their country of re@@ si@@ d@@ ence and their country of employment , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the situation most f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble to them .
.
( de ) F@@ in@@ ding p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to the problems of the 4@@ 20 000 c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order com@@ m@@ u@@ ters also means making people aware and ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ ti@@ ve of the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market and the freedom of movement it gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es .
this is why I w@@ ar@@ m@@ ly welcome the fact that Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en &apos;s report ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses a number of these problems and their or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ s as well as pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing measures which will m@@ it@@ i@@ g@@ ate the effects of these dis@@ par@@ ities between the systems of ta@@ x@@ ation and social w@@ el@@ f@@ are for those who are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by them .
the dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es between national legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons and the principle of free movement are pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y due to the fact that R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 is ou@@ t@@ d@@ ated and , because of the many ch@@ an@@ g@@ es that have o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red in the per@@ i@@ o@@ d since its ad@@ op@@ tion , can no longer o@@ f@@ f@@ er em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es the legal c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y they re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e .
the di@@ rec@@ t con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of this in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation is that frontier workers are often at a dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge in terms of w@@ el@@ f@@ are b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its , un@@ employment , pen@@ sion pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on and health c@@ are .
in the last @-@ n@@ a@@ m@@ ed area , I particularly welcome the initiative of pla@@ y@@ ers in the health sector to o@@ f@@ f@@ er &apos; ex@@ por@@ ta@@ ble &apos; services which take account of the specific c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order com@@ m@@ u@@ ters .
just as n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous legal un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ti@@ es have ar@@ is@@ en in the d@@ om@@ a@@ in@@ s of health and social w@@ el@@ f@@ are , a si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r situation has o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red in the re@@ al@@ m of tax legislation , and the various b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ta@@ x@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents have not su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing these un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ti@@ es .
this c@@ re@@ a@@ tes areas of in@@ e@@ quality , both between c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order com@@ m@@ u@@ ters and between local authorities , and these can only be el@@ im@@ in@@ ated in the f@@ o@@ re@@ se@@ e@@ able future through co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of all our tax systems on a European sc@@ al@@ e .
for this reason , we cannot but support Mrs O@@ om@@ en @-@ R@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ t@@ en &apos;s proposal that a directive be adopted which com@@ m@@ its the Member States to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine all le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive b@@ il@@ l@@ s concerning tax and social w@@ el@@ f@@ are for their effects on c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order com@@ m@@ u@@ ters and to c@@ re@@ ate com@@ pen@@ sa@@ t@@ or@@ y m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s .
despite n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous op@@ in@@ i@@ ons that have been d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red by the European Parliament in favour of the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of social and f@@ is@@ c@@ al legislation , and despite the p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion by the Commission of con@@ c@@ re@@ te proposals for the u@@ p@@ d@@ ating and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fication of R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 , the M@@ in@@ is@@ ters of the Member States have been b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ king this necessary reform process in the Council , th@@ e@@ re@@ by pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market from b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing a re@@ al@@ ity for people in Europe .
- ( D@@ E ) T@@ he report on the situation of frontier workers with which the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs has p@@ res@@ en@@ ted us un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly st@@ em@@ s from the la@@ u@@ d@@ able in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of en@@ sur@@ ing that frontier workers are not subject to dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation in terms of pa@@ y , working conditions and social security and of res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the problems that still per@@ s@@ is@@ t in these areas .
that is what we all want .
however , it is an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation to su@@ g@@ g@@ est , as the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment of this report su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ s , that the internal market , of which the free movement of workers is a cor@@ n@@ er@@ st@@ one , is an ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te f@@ ar@@ ce in the d@@ a@@ il@@ y li@@ v@@ es of these people .
that is just as much di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed from re@@ al@@ ity as various as@@ s@@ er@@ tions in the resolution ; some of the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds it makes are t@@ an@@ ta@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to k@@ ic@@ king at open d@@ o@@ or@@ s , at least in relation to the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of the 8@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 frontier workers in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
it is simply un@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ e that family members are ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded from pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons and b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its in the country of employment .
of course there are di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between p@@ ri@@ va@@ te s@@ ch@@ em@@ es and the public w@@ el@@ f@@ are systems , but such di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences apply e@@ qu@@ ally to those who are not frontier workers .
of course there are di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing systems of pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on for the el@@ d@@ er@@ ly .
these not only di@@ f@@ f@@ er from one Member State to another but even di@@ f@@ f@@ er within Member States .
my pen@@ sion ent@@ it@@ l@@ ement would be greater if I had been em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in the public sector .
that , however , is not a problem that s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally concerns frontier workers .
of course there are di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between Member States in terms of the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of pen@@ sion s@@ ch@@ em@@ es , con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions and pen@@ si@@ on@@ able ag@@ es .
the frontier workers who are em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g re@@ j@@ o@@ ice in these di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences , because our pen@@ si@@ ons are far more g@@ en@@ er@@ ous than those in B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce and G@@ er@@ many , where our frontier workers li@@ ve .
although some el@@ em@@ ents of the social security system are tax @-@ f@@ un@@ d@@ ed in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , this does not result in in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities , because frontier workers are also ent@@ it@@ led to the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its , such as those under the c@@ are @-@ in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , a right which even ap@@ p@@ li@@ es in B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m and F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
the resolution b@@ em@@ o@@ ans the fact that there is no longer a clear d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion in Member States between social assistance and social security .
this is not t@@ r@@ u@@ e either .
social assistance is not really a problem for frontier workers at all , because they are em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es with no need of social assistance .
n@@ or do I understand what per@@ i@@ od@@ s of se@@ con@@ d@@ ment have to do with frontier workers .
there is , of course , a directive co@@ ver@@ ing em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es se@@ con@@ ded by their em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ er , but that directive cannot be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to frontier workers .
and as far as the j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments of the European Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice in the K@@ o@@ h@@ l and D@@ ec@@ k@@ er cases are concerned , it is clear that all citizens of the Union , and h@@ ence frontier workers too , can b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from health services in other Member States .
here too , the report is t@@ r@@ ying to force an open d@@ o@@ or .
I f@@ el@@ t it was important to make this clear , because it is not the first time that Parliament has made such h@@ al@@ f @-@ b@@ a@@ k@@ ed d@@ em@@ an@@ ds in one of its reports .
back in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , when we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the L@@ an@@ c@@ k@@ er report , I em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed that it was ab@@ sur@@ d to c@@ la@@ i@@ m that there was any in@@ h@@ er@@ ent dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation against frontier workers .
at that time the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s had made the r@@ i@@ d@@ ic@@ ul@@ ous proposal that a com@@ pen@@ sa@@ t@@ or@@ y f@@ un@@ d be c@@ re@@ ated for l@@ o@@ s@@ s of in@@ come su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by frontier workers .
it is important to frontier workers that there should be no ta@@ m@@ per@@ ing with the principle that in@@ come ta@@ x@@ es and w@@ el@@ f@@ are con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions are pa@@ y@@ able in the country of employment .
this is the pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite if frontier workers are to en@@ j@@ o@@ y all the social b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its that are g@@ r@@ an@@ ted in the country of employment to workers who re@@ si@@ d@@ e there and to their de@@ pen@@ d@@ an@@ ts .
that is how it is in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , and that is how it is su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to be e@@ ver@@ y@@ where - no more and no less .
motion for a resolution on environment directives ( B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 3@@ 8 / 2001 )
although the directives on con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of natural ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s , the el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of P@@ C@@ B@@ s and P@@ C@@ T@@ s , and the protection of w@@ a@@ ters from n@@ it@@ ra@@ te p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion are only in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in the Member States , this does not mean by any means that these are p@@ o@@ or directives which must be ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed , as some people in this House would se@@ e@@ k to have us believe .
these directives fully li@@ ve up to the a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons of the citizens of Europe , who are d@@ em@@ an@@ ding that greater attention be pa@@ i@@ d to environmental matters and are se@@ e@@ king ar@@ b@@ it@@ ra@@ tion from the European authorities .
the great n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts and p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons received by the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons regarding environmental in@@ f@@ ra@@ c@@ tions and v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of these directives te@@ st@@ i@@ fy to these ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
the fact is , if the directives are only par@@ ti@@ ally im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted , it is because the Member States had not w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ed the consequences when ad@@ op@@ ting them .
they had not taken on bo@@ ar@@ d the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations of the financial costs or the amendments , which could be f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l , that these directives would re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e in their policies .
this is t@@ r@@ u@@ e both of the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive and the N@@ it@@ ra@@ tes D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive since they both re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e the re@@ view of agricultural and regional pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing policies which may cause p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion or d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of natural en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ments .
the implementation of the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive is in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to provide long @-@ term protection for a European n@@ et@@ work of b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding natural ha@@ b@@ it@@ at@@ s and to ex@@ em@@ p@@ t them from future re@@ development in order to pre@@ v@@ ent con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in land use or d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to those en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ments .
these objectives have , ad@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ d@@ ly , been very b@@ ad@@ ly p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in the Member States , c@@ a@@ using o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on@@ ally very b@@ it@@ te@@ r con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts between the o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and u@@ s@@ ers of these areas .
yet there was no sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge of positive results in those in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es where pro@@ per co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation was ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , since the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive does indeed make it possible to support heritage @-@ f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly management m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s by making a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion available .
this H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive is t@@ r@@ u@@ ly in@@ no@@ va@@ tive in terms of regional pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing and nature con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion in that it re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ es the management and the use of ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding natural s@@ it@@ es in order to make the best use of land .
to this end , the European Union must make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to support the implementation of this directive .
the European Union ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly must not y@@ i@@ el@@ d to the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al interests which would n@@ e@@ g@@ ate the very s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of the directive .
the Commission , as G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an of the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es , must firstly adopt a f@@ ir@@ m st@@ ance with regard to the Member States in order to ensure that they implement these directives and , secondly , to st@@ and f@@ ir@@ m against at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to a@@ m@@ en@@ d these directives even before they have been able to d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te their full re@@ le@@ v@@ ance , particularly in the areas of de@@ al@@ ing with n@@ it@@ ra@@ te p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion in w@@ a@@ ter and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting and ra@@ is@@ ing the prof@@ il@@ e of ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding natural s@@ it@@ es .
for the above reasons , the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s su@@ p@@ por@@ ts all the reports p@@ res@@ en@@ ted , particularly the S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t report , which will con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the implementation of the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive .
the reason why we ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ed , then , is that we do not feel that the last @-@ min@@ u@@ te at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to change the nature of the report , se@@ e@@ king to w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ en the H@@ ab@@ it@@ at@@ s D@@ i@@ rec@@ tive and to ur@@ ge that it be a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed , are in line with res@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the directives on which we are v@@ o@@ ting .
P@@ ar@@ ish report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 7 / 2000 )
F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o ( P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E ) .
( it ) Mr President , I would be most gra@@ te@@ ful if you would res@@ er@@ ve just a s@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t of your attention , which I am sure is in no sh@@ or@@ t su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , for the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of my vote for the P@@ ar@@ ish report on young farmers .
I would st@@ res@@ s the importance of m@@ il@@ k pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by young farmers and of su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t at this difficult time for the farming world .
I re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er a f@@ il@@ m from the 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 0@@ s , di@@ rec@@ ted by the f@@ a@@ m@@ ous F@@ ed@@ er@@ ic@@ o F@@ el@@ l@@ in@@ i with A@@ n@@ it@@ a A@@ k@@ b@@ er@@ g in the le@@ ad@@ ing r@@ ol@@ l .
there was a p@@ o@@ st@@ er of her ur@@ g@@ ing all the pa@@ s@@ s@@ ers @-@ by to d@@ r@@ in@@ k m@@ il@@ k .
she was extremely su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful and the i@@ d@@ e@@ al ac@@ t@@ res@@ s to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e the I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ ans to d@@ r@@ in@@ k m@@ il@@ k .
well then , I would like si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r ap@@ p@@ e@@ als to be made to the European citizens now as well , so that farmers can s@@ el@@ l their m@@ il@@ k , which is , I re@@ g@@ re@@ t to say , under th@@ re@@ at from &quot; ma@@ d m@@ il@@ k . &quot;
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the subject of the P@@ ar@@ ish report is the future of young farmers in the European Union .
once again we he@@ a@@ r c@@ al@@ l@@ s for new su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es , for so @-@ called in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion aid .
I voted against the report .
the report p@@ res@@ ents the situation as if all were well with the farming world .
but nothing is well with it .
B@@ S@@ E has c@@ a@@ st d@@ ou@@ b@@ t on the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e agricultural system .
we s@@ pen@@ d al@@ most D@@ E@@ M 1@@ 00 b@@ il@@ li@@ on of our p@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ y c@@ as@@ h on ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture every year .
that , indeed , re@@ p@@ res@@ ents h@@ al@@ f of the European b@@ u@@ d@@ get .
we are st@@ ar@@ ting to ask ourselves what we get in re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n for this money - s@@ w@@ ine f@@ ever , h@@ or@@ m@@ one @-@ t@@ re@@ ated c@@ al@@ v@@ es , di@@ o@@ x@@ in @-@ in@@ f@@ e@@ st@@ ed h@@ en@@ s and now the B@@ S@@ E e@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ em@@ ic .
I believe we are s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing dis@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ ed by this food c@@ ha@@ in we pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce and perhaps dis@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ ed with ourselves too .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of gra@@ s@@ ses and c@@ e@@ re@@ als , we are fe@@ ed@@ ing c@@ att@@ le with cor@@ p@@ ses of d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic c@@ at@@ s , c@@ ag@@ ed ra@@ ts and other an@@ im@@ als , and I believe this is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y the point that must now be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in this discussion .
the use of w@@ a@@ st@@ e products and ex@@ c@@ re@@ ment in food production is the l@@ o@@ g@@ ical con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of a s@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s agricultural policy , which un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly has to be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to an end right here and now .
we must dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s first pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , so that these su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ation pa@@ y@@ ou@@ ts , the in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments of a com@@ m@@ and ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , can be con@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to the h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y bo@@ o@@ ks .
that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y what we have to te@@ l@@ l the young farmers .
we must t@@ al@@ k about that with young farmers , about the fact that they will have to be able to sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve in the market without su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ation .
this is certainly not the th@@ r@@ u@@ st of the report , which is why it must be re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted .
.
( E@@ l ) T@@ he report by the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment is a mo@@ ve in the right di@@ rec@@ tion .
more funds are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to set young farmers up and re@@ ver@@ se the ex@@ od@@ us towards the to@@ w@@ n@@ s .
young farmers may be the key to re@@ v@@ i@@ v@@ ing ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed areas , small is@@ l@@ an@@ ds and tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities from which the life force is d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing .
what we need is to use new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es , such as the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t , to c@@ re@@ ate a new p@@ le@@ as@@ ant , cultural , te@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ ally ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed environment with a human d@@ im@@ en@@ sion for them to work in .
one important point not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in the A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve , or@@ g@@ an@@ ic , family h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s , given that over @-@ in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve farming le@@ ad@@ s no@@ where ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t to ma@@ d co@@ ws .
- ( S@@ V ) W@@ e Swedish S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts welcome many of the measures proposed by the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment in order to improve the situation for young farmers .
we n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s believe that the EU &apos; s agricultural su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ y ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly and are therefore op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds for an increase in the agricultural su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ y , p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h@@ s 7 , 1@@ 1 and 1@@ 4 of Mr P@@ ar@@ ish &apos; s report .
we are in favour of as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing young farmers without financial resources to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able ex@@ pen@@ ses involved in se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ sing f@@ ar@@ m@@ s and e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
we therefore voted in favour of this report in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of our res@@ er@@ va@@ tions , for there is no guarantee that the b@@ ul@@ k , if not all of this aid will not go to the children of w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y f@@ ar@@ m o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and that , once again , those least well o@@ f@@ f will be le@@ f@@ t by the w@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
at this e@@ ar@@ ly stage , we would d@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ ce the mis@@ ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ation of these funds to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it the children of w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y f@@ ar@@ m o@@ w@@ n@@ ers .
.
I believe that the report from our Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment is most b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and should be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed .
as a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of a rural con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ency , I am ac@@ u@@ te@@ ly aware of the concerns ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed by farmers over the very future of farming in I@@ re@@ land .
it se@@ em@@ s in@@ c@@ re@@ di@@ ble but it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e , that in I@@ re@@ land , where ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture has long been one of the economic b@@ a@@ se@@ s of the country , farmers are now be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to w@@ on@@ d@@ er whether their s@@ ons or d@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ters will be able to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on the family tra@@ d@@ ition .
Mr P@@ ar@@ ish &apos; s report is very ti@@ m@@ el@@ y , and the st@@ u@@ d@@ y on &quot; T@@ he F@@ u@@ ture of Y@@ ou@@ n@@ g F@@ ar@@ m@@ ers in the European Union &quot; by in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ ts which was com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed at his request at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of last year pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a much @-@ n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed f@@ o@@ c@@ us on the whole issue .
young farmers are an essential part of the farming future . they per@@ form a very important role in the social life of v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es and rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities , pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing a whole r@@ an@@ ge of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities and par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating in local as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations .
farmers help to promote a he@@ al@@ th@@ y and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e by ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the l@@ an@@ d@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
in I@@ re@@ land the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment P@@ l@@ an for 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of measures which will as@@ s@@ is@@ t young farmers em@@ b@@ ar@@ king on their farming c@@ a@@ re@@ er .
these in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a new en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ed S@@ ch@@ em@@ e of In@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion A@@ i@@ d to encourage the taking @-@ over of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s by y@@ ou@@ n@@ g@@ er farmers and as@@ s@@ is@@ t young farmers as they first set up in farming .
some £ 3@@ 0 million has been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for this s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , which I hope will sh@@ or@@ tly be ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the Commission .
in addition , a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve r@@ an@@ ge of tax in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es are in place , a@@ im@@ ed at re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p trans@@ f@@ er .
these in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de S@@ to@@ c@@ k R@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f , S@@ ta@@ m@@ p D@@ u@@ ty , C@@ ap@@ it@@ al A@@ c@@ qu@@ is@@ ition and P@@ ro@@ b@@ ate T@@ a@@ x .
C@@ ou@@ pl@@ ed with the E@@ ar@@ ly R@@ e@@ ti@@ re@@ ment S@@ ch@@ em@@ e , it is clear that the su@@ p@@ por@@ ts available to young farmers se@@ t@@ t@@ ing out on a c@@ a@@ re@@ er in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture will be of con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it , and these measures should as@@ s@@ is@@ t in the e@@ ar@@ li@@ er and more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent trans@@ f@@ er of land to y@@ ou@@ n@@ g@@ er farmers .
many young farmers taking over a h@@ ol@@ ding have to make necessary on @-@ f@@ ar@@ m in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments in order to op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e production e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and to ensure the economic su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability of their h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s .
in this regard some G@@ B@@ P 2@@ 3@@ 0 million have been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for on @-@ f@@ ar@@ m in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment under the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment P@@ l@@ an .
in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment s@@ ch@@ em@@ es will co@@ v@@ er F@@ ar@@ m W@@ a@@ st@@ e M@@ an@@ ag@@ ement , I@@ m@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in D@@ a@@ ir@@ y H@@ y@@ g@@ i@@ en@@ e S@@ t@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds and H@@ ou@@ s@@ ing and H@@ an@@ d@@ ling F@@ ac@@ il@@ ities for A@@ l@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
these S@@ ch@@ em@@ es will be open to an in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d number of part @-@ time and full @-@ time farmers , including young tra@@ in@@ ed farmers , and will con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to se@@ c@@ ur@@ ing the v@@ i@@ ability of many farmers .
they will f@@ o@@ c@@ us in particular on young farmers .
it should also be no@@ ted that the nature of these s@@ ch@@ em@@ es s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s a clear commitment to the protection of the environment , an issue which will fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly in the future development of both I@@ r@@ ish and European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , it is im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that we , at European level , ad@@ d@@ res@@ s ourselves towards en@@ sur@@ ing a future for European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
the C@@ om@@ m@@ on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y has been a European su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s st@@ or@@ y , and we want to k@@ e@@ e@@ p it that way .
the future li@@ es with our young farmers and with agricultural p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es which are su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able and pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the environment .
we must l@@ end our full support to these objectives .
.
( P@@ T ) T@@ he situation and the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of young farmers de@@ pen@@ d a great deal on the situation and pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture in the EU itself .
as we all know , ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and the rural world are in dec@@ line , a dec@@ line in which the common agricultural policy has pla@@ y@@ ed a large part , pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing , as it does , land con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion , in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fication of production , the gra@@ d@@ u@@ al ver@@ ti@@ c@@ al@@ is@@ ation of agricultural pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , all of which con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ fication and rural de@@ population , as pro@@ v@@ ed by a f@@ all in the number of those em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed and in the number of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s of ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 2@@ 2 % and 20 % , res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 .
young farmers re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the new li@@ fe@@ b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d of f@@ ar@@ m@@ s and are c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing the future of ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture in the various regions of the EU .
the f@@ all of ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 2@@ 8 % , in the last dec@@ ad@@ e , in f@@ ar@@ m@@ s w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e o@@ w@@ n@@ ers are under 3@@ 5 years of age pro@@ v@@ es the current n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts .
special measures for Community support for young farmers are therefore c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , although the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l problem li@@ es in the need for a se@@ a change in the C@@ A@@ P .
the P@@ ar@@ ish report , with which I b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly agree , despite its lack of co@@ h@@ er@@ ence , does not f@@ o@@ c@@ us on the necessary ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to policy .
it to@@ y@@ s with the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing framework .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , three amendments which I tabled and which I believe to be important have been adopted . these are :
the need to com@@ m@@ it ourselves to high @-@ quality , su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able agricultural production , which y@@ i@@ el@@ ds products which are sa@@ f@@ e and have a high ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e , through support for b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , support for natural b@@ re@@ ed@@ s and the con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ation of de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ations of or@@ i@@ g@@ in and the c@@ re@@ ation of support m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s for regional products of special quality ;
im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations for rural development and st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l funds to support and c@@ re@@ ate b@@ road public s@@ er@@ v@@ ice n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks , c@@ re@@ ate in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and give a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t to local mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts in the rural world ;
the need to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y and in@@ te@@ gra@@ te legislation a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting young farmers .
the fact that we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing a report on the situation and pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of young farmers in the European Union as@@ su@@ m@@ es very special si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the B@@ S@@ E crisis .
what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed since the well and t@@ r@@ u@@ ly h@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ ical d@@ ra@@ ma@@ t@@ is@@ ation of the crisis in most of our Member States will su@@ re@@ ly do nothing to mo@@ ti@@ va@@ te young people to re@@ main in farming , let al@@ one encourage them to see their future in rural areas , where , as the report so ad@@ m@@ i@@ ra@@ b@@ ly st@@ a@@ tes , they have a very important role to per@@ form in the social life of v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es and rural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities , pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e and con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting to the economic , social and environmental needs of the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity ,
we have greater cause for concern about the future of farming in the European Union than ever before as a result of this ma@@ in@@ ly con@@ su@@ m@@ er @-@ led crisis of con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence , given that the number of farmers under the age of 3@@ 5 has been s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing the sh@@ ar@@ p@@ est dec@@ line for some time and now st@@ an@@ ds at 2@@ 8 % and that the per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of farmers in the population of al@@ most every Member State is f@@ al@@ l@@ ing .
our report con@@ ta@@ in@@ s all the most important and cor@@ rec@@ t di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses as well as all the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds which have to be f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed if su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of young people are to continue to see their future in farming .
this is a l@@ is@@ t of d@@ em@@ an@@ ds to which not only the European Commission but also the Council and all the Member States must p@@ le@@ d@@ ge themselves if they want to pre@@ v@@ ent the de@@ population , d@@ e@@ s@@ ol@@ ation and dec@@ line of rural areas in the European Union and the ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ ying ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ation of our social and cultural problems .
in the EU we need su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able , high @-@ quality agricultural production .
we must de@@ f@@ end and sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d the de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ations of or@@ i@@ g@@ in of our quality pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce , such as our w@@ in@@ es , in the w@@ i@@ d@@ er world , including the W@@ or@@ l@@ d T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation , because our future in the European Union and that of our ex@@ por@@ t trade de@@ pen@@ ds on to@@ p @-@ quality products , for which there is a pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous and dis@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ ing con@@ su@@ m@@ er market within and be@@ y@@ on@@ d the f@@ r@@ on@@ ti@@ ers of the Union .
there is a t@@ en@@ d@@ ency to put the b@@ la@@ me for the present problems , and especially for the B@@ S@@ E crisis , on the agricultural com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , which is ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly c@@ he@@ a@@ p food .
because I was a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the C@@ on@@ su@@ m@@ ers &apos; C@@ on@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tive Council of the European Commission for many years , I should also like to re@@ f@@ er here to the responsibility of con@@ su@@ m@@ er organisations , which , he@@ ed@@ less of pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers &apos; in@@ comes , have been p@@ res@@ sing in@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ tly for l@@ o@@ w@@ er con@@ su@@ m@@ er pr@@ ic@@ es for food .
again and again in the se@@ v@@ en@@ ti@@ es and e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ti@@ es , and more rec@@ ently too , they s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e out against the pa@@ y@@ ment of appropriate pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ er pr@@ ic@@ es in the framework of the common organisation of the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts in agricultural products .
so they too are par@@ tly responsible for the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ation of farming , for the fact that co@@ ws have been t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed into c@@ ar@@ n@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ res and that the right of farmers to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve pro@@ per re@@ w@@ ar@@ d for their efforts has been dis@@ re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded .
this has to be em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed in the present debate .
I am an en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ st@@ ic pro@@ p@@ on@@ ent of this report , because it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s and clearly en@@ un@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ tes all the things that are right and important for the p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion of family @-@ o@@ w@@ n@@ ed f@@ ar@@ m@@ s in Europe , without which there can be no support for or@@ g@@ an@@ ic farming with its high @-@ quality regional s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ ities , which con@@ su@@ m@@ ers must le@@ ar@@ n to ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate and for which they must be pre@@ pa@@ red to pa@@ y a f@@ a@@ i@@ r pr@@ ice .
it has been no@@ ted that the situation of young farmers is a serious problem in the European Union and they do not have any real pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts despite the support pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the Union and the Member States .
this is why I consider this report to be so important and why I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that we have voted in favour of it .
the economic situation is un@@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es extremely serious , particularly for young people .
there is a real lack of pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for young farmers , as well as a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant dec@@ re@@ a@@ se in the n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of farmers in general , with an increase in the age of those re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing .
what can the European Union do ?
the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t , having been as@@ k@@ ed to give its opinion on this subject , did not wish to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on aspects which f@@ el@@ l within the re@@ m@@ its of other com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es .
we therefore ch@@ o@@ s@@ e to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the issues as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with education , training and information policies and the social and cultural life of young farmers .
we no@@ te that young farmers ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence problems re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from education and training that is often p@@ o@@ or@@ ly su@@ ited to their needs .
even A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ ts these f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally important aspects .
the European Union must encourage , through its S@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ tes and L@@ e@@ on@@ ar@@ do P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ es , measures to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then education and training f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities for young farmers in order to ra@@ ise their s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s to the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red level .
it training must be set up .
In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t access must become a re@@ al@@ ity , and young farmers must be able to become ac@@ qu@@ a@@ in@@ ted with in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted production and mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting management systems so as to man@@ age their h@@ ol@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
de@@ population may be com@@ b@@ ated , in particular by ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing public services in rural areas ( sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , p@@ o@@ s@@ t o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es , transport services ) , and social f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities may be ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed by p@@ o@@ ol@@ ing the resources of se@@ ver@@ al com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ es , for example , or by res@@ or@@ ting to the use of mo@@ b@@ il@@ e services .
if the right conditions for re@@ v@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ ing farming are f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed , then young ur@@ b@@ an d@@ w@@ el@@ l@@ ers en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ st@@ ic about nature and k@@ e@@ en to improve their quality of life will be able to se@@ t@@ t@@ le in the country and rural y@@ ou@@ th will no longer ab@@ an@@ d@@ on the f@@ ar@@ m@@ s pa@@ s@@ sed on to them by their par@@ ents .
- ( S@@ V ) T@@ he Swedish C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts have voted against the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t report since we find it in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of the fact that the subject as such - the situation of young farmers - is of p@@ res@@ sing importance .
we especially ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t to par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 1@@ 0 in which the un@@ re@@ as@@ on@@ able proposal is made that the &apos; EU should consider making it man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y for the Member States to provide min@@ im@@ u@@ m levels of in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tion aid to young farmers &apos; .
in our view , this is em@@ p@@ ha@@ ti@@ c@@ ally not a su@@ pr@@ an@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al issue .
V@@ a@@ re@@ l@@ a S@@ u@@ an@@ z@@ es @-@ C@@ ar@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 6@@ 5 / 2000 )
Mr President , the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party , which I re@@ p@@ res@@ ent at the European Parliament , con@@ si@@ d@@ ers that the Commission , Parliament and the Council should change a major part of the fisheries policy and c@@ al@@ l@@ s upon them to do so . the se@@ c@@ tion in question is the part which re@@ f@@ ers to the now e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed practice of fishing the w@@ a@@ ters of other countries and then re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ing our con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ence by pa@@ ying a su@@ m of money to the governments w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e w@@ a@@ ters we have f@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
I have always been t@@ ol@@ d to give to those who have not .
however , I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that we E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans are not g@@ i@@ v@@ ing an@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y an@@ y@@ th@@ ing but are going to f@@ ish the w@@ a@@ ters of others in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d .
I am quite aware of the problems of f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , which we do have to res@@ ol@@ ve , but we must res@@ ol@@ ve them in some other way , not to the d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ ent of the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e only li@@ v@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ d is fishing .
G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 3 / 2000 )
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by sa@@ ying , on behalf of my group , that we are very st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly in favour of con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union , because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for se@@ c@@ ur@@ ing gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es for the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of social and economic development in a l@@ o@@ t of co@@ a@@ st@@ al regions of the European Union , which would have no other b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it and could not get employment or other de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t from their own natural resources , for example fishing and a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture .
however , that said and g@@ i@@ v@@ ing c@@ re@@ d@@ it where c@@ re@@ d@@ it is due , we must also rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that there are a l@@ o@@ t of de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es within the common fisheries policy .
in particular , the to@@ ta@@ l ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion to having a re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ed policy within the common fisheries policy is in@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ t .
this House has re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted that proposal again today .
re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation does not mean r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation or mo@@ v@@ ing a@@ way from a Community mo@@ de@@ l ; it means g@@ i@@ v@@ ing com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities which are b@@ or@@ d@@ er@@ ing each other and are fishing si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies the opportunity to come together to man@@ age those s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies .
on to@@ p of that , we must also put greater em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on a uni@@ form in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tion system ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s all European Union w@@ a@@ ters and give more p@@ o@@ w@@ ers to the Community in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ s to ensure that all re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions are being pro@@ per@@ ly en@@ for@@ c@@ ed .
finally , I must say that there is a need for con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion .
we have seen a h@@ u@@ ge de@@ p@@ le@@ tion in the fishing st@@ o@@ c@@ ks within the European Union w@@ a@@ ters .
the way to res@@ ol@@ ve con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons is not by mo@@ v@@ ing to different f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing them into a qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system , but by en@@ sur@@ ing that we have certain no @-@ go areas where we can allow fishing st@@ o@@ c@@ ks to r@@ e @-@ ma@@ ture .
this example has already been pro@@ v@@ en in certain areas by v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents in I@@ r@@ ish w@@ a@@ ters and by ma@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ance of these non @-@ fishing areas - so @-@ called set @-@ a@@ si@@ de areas , to give the an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ y with the common agricultural policy - for a certain per@@ i@@ o@@ d of time .
that is the one way of gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing that we can k@@ e@@ e@@ p a food s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce going , provide employment and pro@@ te@@ c@@ t environmental con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations within our fishing w@@ a@@ ters .
that is why we su@@ p@@ por@@ ted the G@@ al@@ la@@ g@@ h@@ er report .
Mr President , I voted for this report on the common fisheries policy , but I call upon the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to m@@ on@@ it@@ or more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y one of the f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s re@@ f@@ er@@ red to in par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 20 of the report , which is dis@@ re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y how and whether the si@@ z@@ e of the pen@@ si@@ ons and situation of the pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers in the fisheries sector and , in particular , in the small @-@ sc@@ al@@ e fishing sector , are m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d .
we have a responsibility to pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers to concern ourselves , as well as with all the other important aspects of fisheries , with how the national States pro@@ te@@ c@@ t re@@ ti@@ red f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , as they are the last to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent protection in the area of pen@@ si@@ ons .
.
( E@@ l ) M@@ y group voted in favour of the resolution .
however , I must h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t one particular issue . acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to current Community legislation , G@@ re@@ e@@ k f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men have ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve fishing rights within a z@@ one of 6 n@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ c@@ al m@@ il@@ es , as op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to the 1@@ 2 n@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ c@@ al m@@ il@@ es which apply to the other Member States of the EU , especially the Mediterranean countries .
this means that G@@ re@@ e@@ k f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men are not being t@@ re@@ ated e@@ qu@@ ally and are at a dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge com@@ pa@@ red with the other countries under the common fisheries policy .
given that , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment in A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 5 , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 1 of A@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ x I@@ X to the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on the L@@ a@@ w of the S@@ e@@ a , the Community has s@@ ol@@ e responsibility for con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ing and man@@ ag@@ ing mar@@ ine f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks and , by ex@@ t@@ en@@ sion , the com@@ p@@ et@@ ence to adopt the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant rules and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , the Commission should make use of these p@@ o@@ w@@ ers and give G@@ re@@ e@@ k f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve fishing rights within a z@@ one of 1@@ 2 n@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ c@@ al m@@ il@@ es .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , the European Parliament called in resolution Á@@ 4 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 1@@ 8 / 9@@ 9 ( C @-@ 1@@ 5@@ 3 / 1 @-@ 6 @-@ 9@@ 9 ) for the Commission to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ex@@ t@@ en@@ ding the ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve fishing z@@ one to 2@@ 4 n@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ c@@ al m@@ il@@ es in order to guarantee a su@@ it@@ able dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ation policy and protection for the interests of co@@ a@@ st@@ al areas .
the Commission should adopt this resolution by the European Parliament .
the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y reports on which we are re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er our opinion co@@ v@@ er various aspects of the common fisheries policy , including the management and con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of fisheries resources , st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l policy , the European Union &apos; s external relations on fishing , market organisation , monitoring and con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s .
the Commission has ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed the following priorities : im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the co@@ h@@ er@@ ence between the various objectives of the C@@ F@@ P , especially between the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion of resources , economic e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and employment in fishing @-@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent regions ; greater con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation of the economic si@@ d@@ e of fishing ; im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of environmental and fishing policy ; im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , particularly in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments ; se@@ e@@ king a more trans@@ par@@ ent decision making process and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the external aspects of the C@@ F@@ P .
we can , of course , support all these points in principle .
I think it necessary , however , to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the following points which the Commission does not se@@ e@@ m to have em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ed su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
while it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that the T@@ A@@ C@@ s must be de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ch@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ ly on an objective s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c basis , dialogue with workers in the sector must certainly be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed at in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al level and must be st@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ed up .
the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men must be involved at the e@@ ar@@ li@@ est st@@ ag@@ es p@@ ri@@ or to the s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s &apos; d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ations in order to increase con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence and to en@@ able decisions to be taken which are well @-@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded and more re@@ ad@@ il@@ y acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
such con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion will be even more essential when the time comes to draw up m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ an@@ n@@ u@@ al gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es .
in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tion and pen@@ al@@ ty systems must ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly be h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised between the various fishing areas , in order to pre@@ v@@ ent d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tions between Member States .
the system of in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions carried out by Community countries on third country f@@ le@@ et@@ s op@@ er@@ ating in Community w@@ a@@ ters must be in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fied .
finally , while ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the T@@ A@@ C and qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system at the he@@ ar@@ t of the C@@ F@@ P , we wish to re@@ state the v@@ al@@ u@@ e we at@@ ta@@ ch to res@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the principle of re@@ la@@ tive st@@ ability and our op@@ position to the p@@ ri@@ va@@ t@@ is@@ ation of quotas .
P@@ o@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 3@@ 2 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for this report for I - and the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party - consider that , before taking important decisions , the European Parliament - and not only Parliament but all the government bo@@ di@@ es - should con@@ su@@ l@@ t the groups , p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es and citizens concerned .
the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment st@@ a@@ tes that the Commission con@@ su@@ l@@ ted a large number of bo@@ di@@ es before taking a decision on the common fisheries policy : re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the com@@ p@@ an@@ ies which li@@ ve o@@ f@@ f fishing and re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the fishing bo@@ at e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment com@@ p@@ an@@ ies .
it has con@@ su@@ l@@ ted them all , per@@ for@@ m@@ ing a s@@ or@@ t of con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
that is all well and good , but has it also con@@ su@@ l@@ ted the f@@ ish , Mr President ?
in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 , B@@ l@@ u@@ e Europe , with its common fisheries policy , will be ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed .

firstly , resources are fin@@ ite .
st@@ o@@ c@@ ks such as ha@@ k@@ e , co@@ d , s@@ ar@@ d@@ ine and t@@ u@@ n@@ a , are en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ e@@ red or at r@@ is@@ k .
there is w@@ a@@ st@@ age .
every year , wor@@ l@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e , over 1@@ 5 % of f@@ ish c@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t are th@@ ro@@ w@@ n back into the se@@ a , particularly in the EU , on the pre@@ te@@ x@@ t of ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing pr@@ ic@@ es or in order to respect re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as countries such as N@@ or@@ way make the most of f@@ ish that f@@ all ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the per@@ m@@ it@@ ted l@@ im@@ its .
they make up 20 million t@@ on@@ n@@ es of the to@@ ta@@ l g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al c@@ at@@ ch of 1@@ 2@@ 2 million t@@ on@@ n@@ es .
international and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management , from the UN F@@ o@@ o@@ d and A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation , and the G@@ en@@ er@@ al F@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ ies Council for the Mediterranean , to the North W@@ est A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ ti@@ c fisheries institutions , in which the E@@ C par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ tes .
Europe has also pa@@ s@@ sed 2@@ 5 b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with countries including A@@ n@@ g@@ ol@@ a , the S@@ e@@ y@@ ch@@ el@@ l@@ es and M@@ ad@@ ag@@ as@@ c@@ a@@ r and is at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to come to an agreement with M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , no mean process and one that is currently in di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation , and the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated problem of c@@ he@@ a@@ p im@@ por@@ ts , is now a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting the market .
e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally , the C@@ F@@ P , which often con@@ ta@@ in@@ s too many ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ e re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , must re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ e con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y objectives , i@@ .@@ e@@ . con@@ s@@ er@@ ve f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle , while pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting co@@ a@@ st@@ al com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities and ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies which s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es de@@ pen@@ d on the fishing industry for employment , as in the case of the M@@ an@@ ch@@ e region .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , we need a clear C@@ F@@ P that is f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble enough to take into account specific regional ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s , from the North S@@ e@@ a to the Mediterranean and even , as the I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ ans hope , those of the A@@ d@@ ri@@ a@@ ti@@ c or other su@@ b @-@ regional &quot; se@@ as &quot; .
in particular , we must re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ e the major op@@ en@@ ing up of the European market , im@@ por@@ ting 6@@ 0 % of con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion , with the need to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t our f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , who see the J@@ ap@@ an@@ e@@ s@@ e , A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an and K@@ o@@ re@@ an mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ing .
in order to h@@ an@@ d@@ le such di@@ ver@@ se problems , the European Commission has used an effective m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d that in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion of fisheries and environmental organisations as well as pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers .

j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution on depleted uranium
Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise resolution which we have just pa@@ s@@ sed .
a st@@ r@@ on@@ g and un@@ ited v@@ o@@ ice c@@ al@@ l@@ ing u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ally for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of depleted uranium weapons is a positive st@@ e@@ p forward , even if it does not go as far as we would have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed .
the G@@ re@@ en@@ s and E@@ F@@ A were c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for a com@@ p@@ le@@ te b@@ an on the production , ex@@ por@@ t and use of depleted uranium weapons and we believe that we have a legal as well as a m@@ or@@ al basis for doing so .
the UN C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion of O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 b@@ an@@ n@@ ed the use of certain in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate weapons ; the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 resolution of the S@@ u@@ b @-@ Commission on Human Rights also ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed depleted uranium weapons because of their non @-@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter .
the use of these weapons has already , therefore , been con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed in international law .
we would also have been more re@@ as@@ su@@ red if the resolution had in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded our concerns about the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y which is being used to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the r@@ is@@ ks of depleted uranium .
a g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing number of s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s are now ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ ing the con@@ v@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ al m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , which is based on d@@ o@@ ses of external ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive ra@@ y@@ s rather than in@@ ter@@ n@@ ally in@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed or in@@ h@@ al@@ ed par@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es .
re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that de@@ a@@ th@@ s from le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from the C@@ h@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ sion have been one h@@ un@@ d@@ red ti@@ m@@ es more than pre@@ d@@ ic@@ ted by the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant ra@@ di@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical protection bo@@ ar@@ ds , which have based their pre@@ d@@ ic@@ tions on external ra@@ y@@ s .
the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of this er@@ ro@@ r con@@ c@@ e@@ als the fact that even very l@@ o@@ w d@@ o@@ ses of ra@@ di@@ ation , like that from depleted uranium , can in fact have de@@ va@@ st@@ ating health im@@ pa@@ c@@ ts .
it is therefore essential that we get this m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y right or el@@ se all the te@@ st@@ s and s@@ c@@ re@@ en@@ ing in the world will be simply wor@@ th@@ less .
finally , I would like to re@@ f@@ er to the report on the f@@ r@@ on@@ t pa@@ ge of last w@@ e@@ e@@ k &apos;s European V@@ o@@ ice , which pro@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ s that the new EU ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force is ap@@ par@@ ently pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to use depleted uranium weapons .
now re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er this is a h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an force , which is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to use a w@@ e@@ ap@@ on that will le@@ a@@ ve an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous le@@ g@@ ac@@ y of c@@ an@@ c@@ ers a@@ m@@ on@@ g the very c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans it is su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to be there to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t .
this is nothing sh@@ or@@ t of s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ ous and must be over@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed .
Mr President , I su@@ p@@ por@@ ted the j@@ o@@ in@@ t resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to re@@ ta@@ in the re@@ f@@ er@@ ence and the call for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on these weapons .
I would have pre@@ f@@ er@@ red a st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ er resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that .
what I do want to say , however , is that I de@@ pl@@ or@@ e the att@@ it@@ u@@ de dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed by Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a here this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
at the same time as dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ing he was in favour of transparency and op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s in relation to this issue , he ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that he only be@@ g@@ an to take action on it when it b@@ ec@@ a@@ me a public issue about a w@@ e@@ e@@ k ago , despite his role as S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al of NATO during the Balkans W@@ a@@ r .
he also f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to m@@ en@@ tion or to give a view on the question whether there ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on these weapons .
I de@@ pl@@ or@@ e also his at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to make this Parliament com@@ pl@@ ic@@ it in the decision by NATO to use these weapons .
the use of these weapons was dis@@ pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ ate to the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge that was being f@@ ac@@ ed by NATO , particularly in the war against S@@ er@@ b@@ i@@ a , and was therefore un@@ necessary and was a c@@ al@@ l@@ ous dis@@ regard of the effects on the population at large .
it was a c@@ al@@ l@@ ous dis@@ regard of the effect it would have on the NATO t@@ ro@@ op@@ s , and indeed it was a c@@ al@@ l@@ ous dis@@ regard of the after @-@ effects on aid workers and p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing for@@ c@@ es , both military and p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e , in the a@@ f@@ ter@@ ma@@ th of that war .
I would ur@@ ge , as others have ur@@ g@@ ed , that the new ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force should not have available to it these t@@ y@@ p@@ es of weapons .
indeed I will be c@@ al@@ l@@ ing on my own government in I@@ re@@ land to re@@ f@@ u@@ se to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in this ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ action force un@@ less there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used .
.
( E@@ l ) Ô@@ he only pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e which the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution on the &quot; B@@ al@@ k@@ an s@@ y@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ om@@ e &quot; s@@ er@@ v@@ es is to co@@ v@@ er up the c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al policy of NATO and the European Union which , on the pre@@ te@@ x@@ t of de@@ f@@ en@@ ding human rights , in@@ va@@ ded Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a , c@@ a@@ using in@@ c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ble per@@ s@@ on@@ al in@@ j@@ ur@@ y and ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge .
and to ensure that the b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s were even more d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive , they had no qu@@ al@@ m@@ s about using weapons with depleted uranium sh@@ el@@ l@@ s , despite the fact that they were well aware of their de@@ ad@@ ly long @-@ term impact from the war against I@@ ra@@ q .
t@@ y@@ p@@ ic@@ ally , the proposed amendment from the group of the le@@ f@@ t c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for a b@@ an on the production , te@@ st@@ ing , use and s@@ al@@ e of depleted uranium weapons was o@@ st@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ ou@@ s@@ ly re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted by the con@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the members of the European Parliament , att@@ ra@@ c@@ ting a m@@ er@@ e 2@@ 3 % of the v@@ o@@ tes .
of course , the European Parliament ac@@ ted t@@ r@@ u@@ e to form , as the war c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al , the for@@ m@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al of NATO and the current H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the EU , J@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ er S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , c@@ y@@ n@@ ic@@ ally p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out in his in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion , because it was the European Parliament itself which in@@ s@@ is@@ ted on military in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion in the Balkans , both in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o .
we would , of course , be d@@ el@@ u@@ d@@ ing ourselves if we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted war c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als to acc@@ use themselves .
that j@@ o@@ b b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to the people .
the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly called both for a b@@ an on the use of depleted uranium and for the o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ ying for@@ c@@ es to le@@ a@@ ve the Balkans im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly and for NATO and the EU to be@@ a@@ r the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of t@@ re@@ ating and com@@ pen@@ sa@@ ting v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s and c@@ le@@ an@@ ing up the environment .
the M@@ E@@ P@@ s of the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e voted against the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution and call on the people to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise and de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p their own un@@ ited res@@ is@@ t@@ ance to , and la@@ un@@ ch their own c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter @-@ at@@ ta@@ c@@ k on , the b@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ ic new order .
- ( D@@ A ) T@@ he j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution con@@ ta@@ in@@ s many s@@ en@@ si@@ ble i@@ d@@ e@@ as but does not do j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to the very difficult situation in which NATO has pla@@ c@@ ed the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population in the Balkans , the s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers who were st@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ed there and their de@@ pen@@ d@@ ents .
ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 20 Balkans v@@ e@@ ter@@ ans have di@@ ed from le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a , and the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e is g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing .
A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers in K@@ F@@ O@@ R were w@@ ar@@ n@@ ed against b@@ re@@ a@@ th@@ ing in depleted uranium .
they were w@@ ar@@ n@@ ed against t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ing an@@ y@@ th@@ ing which might be su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ted of having been in con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with depleted uranium ; they were called upon to le@@ a@@ ve areas su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ted of having been p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ted by d@@ u@@ st from depleted uranium weapons ; and they were ur@@ g@@ ed to w@@ as@@ h their uni@@ for@@ m@@ s often .
we do not think that the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an ar@@ my pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es w@@ ar@@ n@@ in@@ g@@ s of this kind without good reason .
there have also been a number of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing that b@@ re@@ a@@ th@@ ing in depleted uranium is extremely d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous to health .
the consequences for the civil population in those areas ex@@ p@@ o@@ sed to military action by NATO have by no means been th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ated .
however , only the future will dec@@ i@@ d@@ e the matter .
we therefore believe it is quite in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate m@@ e@@ re@@ ly to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out another in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ation into the consequences of using depleted uranium weapons .
we believe the matter has now been quite c@@ a@@ re@@ fully ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed .
in our view , the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle must , in any case , also co@@ v@@ er those who report for international as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ments , as well as the civil population in war z@@ on@@ es .
these weapons should be co@@ v@@ e@@ red by the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of the G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion concerning ch@@ em@@ ical and n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r weapons .
all production ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , and all st@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ il@@ es d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
we d@@ em@@ and an end to the use of depleted uranium weapons now .
the fact that , for at least 1@@ 0 years , the ar@@ m@@ i@@ es of the most p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful countries have k@@ no@@ w@@ n about the h@@ ar@@ m@@ ful effects of depleted uranium weapons , including the effects on those using them , pro@@ v@@ es that ar@@ my le@@ ad@@ ers have as much con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t for their own s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers as they have for the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population and the en@@ em@@ y for@@ c@@ es .
we have good cause to be ou@@ tra@@ ged at the effects that using such weapons has had upon NATO s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers . we have even more reason to be ou@@ tra@@ ged at the effects on the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population , the people who were k@@ il@@ led by depleted uranium weapons in just the same way as those k@@ il@@ led by con@@ v@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ al b@@ om@@ b@@ s .
yet , what should we make of the h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ical sur@@ pr@@ ise s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n by the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of all these political parties that to@@ o@@ k part in the decision to b@@ om@@ b S@@ er@@ b@@ i@@ a and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of w@@ h@@ o@@ m did so after su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r ?
they g@@ a@@ ve ar@@ my le@@ ad@@ ers a free hand and , today , f@@ ac@@ ed with the public &apos; s re@@ action , they are pre@@ t@@ en@@ ding to be concerned about the consequences of their decision while t@@ r@@ ying to sh@@ ir@@ k their own res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
we voted in favour of the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t amendment from the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ al Group of the European United L@@ e@@ f@@ t which re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed a &quot; b@@ an on the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture , te@@ st@@ ing , use and s@@ al@@ e of depleted uranium m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ons &quot; , even though we acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted that this would not t@@ u@@ r@@ n an un@@ just war into a &quot; c@@ le@@ an war &quot; .
we voted against the com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise resolution to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter our pro@@ te@@ st against the use of depleted uranium weapons , against w@@ ar@@ f@@ are itself w@@ h@@ en@@ ever it is used , but also against the h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ is@@ y of the parties su@@ p@@ por@@ ting such w@@ ar@@ s .
the general public is particularly concerned about the l@@ in@@ k between the depleted uranium used in weapons and public health .
at the moment of impact , these weapons un@@ le@@ as@@ h ch@@ em@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tions , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e effects upon s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans and the environment are still not k@@ no@@ w@@ n .
mo@@ re@@ over , uranium , even the depleted v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y which is 20 % less ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive than natural uranium , is still a form of n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r w@@ a@@ st@@ e and d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous to use .
there may be a l@@ in@@ k between the cases of le@@ u@@ k@@ a@@ em@@ i@@ a f@@ ou@@ n@@ d in s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers who have s@@ er@@ v@@ ed in the Balkans and the use of such weapons by NATO .
even though con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve pro@@ of has not yet been b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t forward , and even if there is no con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s a@@ m@@ on@@ g s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s , what we have today is more than m@@ er@@ e su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion , as is s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n by the results of various en@@ qu@@ i@@ ri@@ es .
this concern is therefore well g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ded and should not be t@@ re@@ ated li@@ g@@ h@@ tly .
until we ob@@ ta@@ in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve pro@@ of , we should apply the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle and im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of such weapons .
this is the very least on which we can dec@@ i@@ d@@ e today , before a to@@ ta@@ l b@@ an is im@@ p@@ o@@ sed , should the st@@ u@@ di@@ es con@@ f@@ ir@@ m the d@@ an@@ g@@ er .
NATO should be to@@ t@@ ally open about the use of these weapons and about the con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t of its op@@ er@@ ations in general , and the European Commission should itself be@@ g@@ in an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
we o@@ we it to all the people who are currently su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing or li@@ v@@ ing under this th@@ re@@ at to d@@ em@@ and t@@ r@@ u@@ th and transparency .
at a time when international law is t@@ en@@ ding towards the ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly on h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds in de@@ f@@ ence of human rights , the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population cannot be put at r@@ is@@ k by the ar@@ m@@ ed for@@ c@@ es su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t it .
the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment se@@ ts out our j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied concerns regarding this important issue , which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts the health of s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers involved in op@@ er@@ ations in difficult areas .
the local p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions involved n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally have a v@@ e@@ st@@ ed interest in this , especially in relation to the necessary c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a for the social , economic and environmental re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted areas .
in its en@@ ti@@ re@@ ty , therefore , the resolution is f@@ a@@ i@@ r and I fully support it .
however , as it st@@ an@@ ds , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 6 g@@ o@@ es too far , as it st@@ an@@ ds , in c@@ al@@ l@@ ing upon NATO m@@ em@@ b@@ er st@@ a@@ tes to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m , as the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary principle is in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t which ur@@ g@@ es NATO to consider other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of weapons until the results of the en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y on depleted uranium are pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
since I am un@@ able to support par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 6 , I have therefore dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to ab@@ st@@ a@@ in from v@@ o@@ ting on the whole te@@ x@@ t .
.
( P@@ T ) W@@ e are v@@ o@@ ting against the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution that has been tabled because we cannot accept that we are still t@@ r@@ ying to d@@ en@@ y the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the serious effects on the health of people in areas a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by the use of weapons con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing depleted uranium .
since the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the n@@ u@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ r age , which st@@ ar@@ ted at the time of the S@@ ec@@ on@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d W@@ a@@ r , we have been aware of the r@@ is@@ ks and the p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ tions when de@@ al@@ ing with uranium and other ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es because this is a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly to@@ x@@ ic el@@ ement ( both ch@@ em@@ ic@@ ally and ra@@ di@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally ) , when in@@ h@@ al@@ ed or in@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed and is also a th@@ re@@ at in g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c terms .
the use of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition by the U@@ S and other NATO countries during the G@@ ul@@ f war , in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a and in K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o has already c@@ a@@ u@@ sed the death of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing and death for the in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of areas that were b@@ om@@ b@@ ed and the environmental p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion in a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted areas , with m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m@@ - and long @-@ term consequences , which will a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t not only the present g@@ en@@ er@@ ation but also future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations , which is pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ ited by the G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
this makes it quite clear that there is no such th@@ ing as a &quot; c@@ le@@ an war &quot; .
therefore , given the sc@@ al@@ e of the c@@ r@@ im@@ e that has been com@@ m@@ it@@ ted against whole c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions , it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al that we in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate , t@@ r@@ y and con@@ v@@ ic@@ t the le@@ ad@@ ers responsible for this c@@ r@@ im@@ e against h@@ u@@ man@@ ity , and im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly b@@ an the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture , te@@ st@@ ing , use and s@@ al@@ e of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of w@@ e@@ ap@@ on con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing depleted uranium , not simply ap@@ pro@@ ve a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m .
.
the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation of L@@ ab@@ our M@@ E@@ P@@ s w@@ el@@ comes the action taken by NATO m@@ em@@ b@@ er st@@ a@@ tes to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of de@@ a@@ th@@ s and il@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by t@@ ro@@ op@@ s who s@@ er@@ v@@ ed in the Balkans .
we believe that con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation of the use of depleted uranium should be based on s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c fact .
we no@@ te that as yet there is no e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence to l@@ in@@ k depleted uranium and il@@ l health su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red either by t@@ ro@@ op@@ s or c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ ans .
for that reason , we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of depleted uranium weapons .
did the dis@@ co@@ very of the d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous nature of depleted uranium weapons really come as a sur@@ pr@@ ise ?
we all know that these weapons , used by NATO during the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r ( 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 ) , and the con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts in B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a ( 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 @-@ 5 ) and K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o ( 1999 ) had serious consequences , firstly , for the c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an population that was b@@ om@@ b@@ ed , for their environment , and for the s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers there , whether NATO , I@@ ra@@ q@@ i , B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ an , S@@ er@@ b@@ i@@ an or K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ an for@@ c@@ es .
for a long time , the military and political authorities simply p@@ ou@@ red sc@@ or@@ n on an@@ y@@ one who ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed concern about this matter .
A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an and then French s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers had to get or@@ g@@ an@@ ised before the s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al was e@@ v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ally u@@ n@@ e@@ ar@@ th@@ ed , following the su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ i@@ ous death of an I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an .
there is no such th@@ ing as a &apos; c@@ le@@ an &apos; war .
the un@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en con@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ sion of for@@ c@@ es for@@ m@@ er@@ ly involved in com@@ b@@ at should allow us to get right to the bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m of the res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities of the government and ar@@ my le@@ ad@@ ers , pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a , the for@@ m@@ er S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al of NATO .
we must d@@ em@@ and a b@@ an on the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ ture , te@@ st@@ ing , use and s@@ al@@ e of depleted uranium weapons .
we are in favour of si@@ g@@ n@@ ing an international t@@ re@@ at@@ y and , in the sh@@ or@@ t term , we d@@ em@@ and a programme for the m@@ ed@@ ical ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation of s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers who have taken part in op@@ er@@ ations in the Balkans , members of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an organisations who have wor@@ k@@ ed in the field and the people li@@ v@@ ing in the areas in question .
.
I voted for the m@@ or@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on weapons using depleted uranium .
I@@ de@@ ally I would have pre@@ f@@ er@@ red a to@@ ta@@ l b@@ an in view of the very high pro@@ b@@ ability that they cause in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to health .
I further de@@ pl@@ or@@ e them on account of their un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble impact on the human and natural environment more w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y .
I particularly wish to re@@ g@@ is@@ ter prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d concern about the environmental d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge that is al@@ most certainly being c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by te@@ st f@@ ir@@ ing at the D@@ un@@ d@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an R@@ an@@ ge on the S@@ ol@@ way F@@ ir@@ th .
these w@@ a@@ ters already su@@ f@@ f@@ er un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble levels of ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion from S@@ el@@ la@@ field .
Mr President , after all the d@@ is@@ t@@ res@@ sing in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents which o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red during the b@@ om@@ b@@ ing of Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and the dis@@ c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ u@@ res about the use of depleted uranium a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition , the to@@ p priority today is to b@@ an this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition , which has d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous consequences both the second it is fi@@ red and for a long time a@@ f@@ ter@@ w@@ ar@@ ds , and which is un@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ating , i@@ .@@ e@@ . which makes no d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion between those who are at r@@ is@@ k of su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing its effects .
we also need , e@@ qu@@ ally ur@@ g@@ ently , to for@@ m@@ u@@ late a large @-@ sc@@ al@@ e assistance , pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion policy for the whole of Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by the use of this a@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ition , in order to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t public health and the environment , c@@ le@@ an up the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d and the w@@ a@@ ters and sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d the un@@ im@@ p@@ ed@@ ed development of the country and the region in general .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution under discussion does not com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly co@@ v@@ er the first objective , but it does have the m@@ er@@ it of c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of these weapons .
as for the second objective , a few general , ab@@ st@@ ra@@ c@@ t re@@ f@@ er@@ ences are made to ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing assistance programmes which , however you look at it , are of l@@ im@@ ited sc@@ op@@ e , while there ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to be no si@@ g@@ n of any in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to en@@ g@@ age in new , e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion at the level of real needs , as c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es re@@ qu@@ i@@ res .
for the re@@ st , the motion for a resolution ex@@ t@@ en@@ ds - with a few b@@ ri@@ e@@ f re@@ f@@ er@@ ences - to very serious matters , such as the an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of and the need for re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch into depleted uranium , but makes no m@@ en@@ tion w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever of the con@@ st@@ ant efforts being made to con@@ f@@ u@@ se and con@@ c@@ e@@ al the f@@ ac@@ ts , in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch which we all know about and even o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al te@@ x@@ ts is@@ su@@ ed by NATO countries on the d@@ an@@ g@@ er of depleted uranium and the pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive measures which they themselves im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e on their for@@ c@@ es .
it is for these reasons that I am un@@ able to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution .
I shall re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n a b@@ l@@ an@@ k b@@ al@@ l@@ o@@ t pa@@ per because the call for a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on the use of depleted uranium may be a positive st@@ e@@ p in the right di@@ rec@@ tion , not that this means that war , in@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally il@@ legal b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s and other si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r , f@@ r@@ u@@ it@@ less in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tions will st@@ o@@ p .
in all e@@ v@@ ents , con@@ st@@ ant efforts must be made and a ma@@ s@@ s movement throughout Europe and the whole world must en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our to bring about a defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve b@@ an on all these weapons , th@@ e@@ re@@ by de@@ al@@ ing a b@@ l@@ o@@ w to the high @-@ h@@ an@@ d@@ ed@@ ness and ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance of the m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ ti@@ c per@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s and the world .
finally , I wish to state that I am n@@ on@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s@@ sed by the political s@@ le@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of hand during our debate : just as we were acc@@ used in the past of s@@ er@@ v@@ ing NATO and the b@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ s by c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ ing M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c &apos;s policy , now Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a acc@@ u@@ se@@ s us , in our c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of the use of depleted uranium , of for@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing the human rights of M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c &apos;s v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
in both cases , an@@ y@@ one with a lack of ar@@ gu@@ ments on the matter at issue will for@@ get the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ m and f@@ li@@ r@@ t with the ir@@ ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al , which is the p@@ rec@@ ur@@ s@@ or to any t@@ y@@ p@@ e of to@@ t@@ al@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an@@ is@@ m or S@@ t@@ al@@ in@@ is@@ m .
resolution on Korea
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of N@@ ations Group voted in favour of the resolution on C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Korea .
it g@@ o@@ es without sa@@ ying that we th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly de@@ pl@@ or@@ e the de@@ ed@@ s com@@ m@@ it@@ ted by the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t d@@ ic@@ ta@@ t@@ or@@ sh@@ i@@ p in North Korea since 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 0 .
the sc@@ or@@ n for human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity that has been dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed is nothing more than the result of the un@@ b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ led ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ m on which C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ m in particular and re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary i@@ d@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y in general are based .
this group ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses the hope that North Korea will in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future re@@ su@@ me a policy of g@@ en@@ u@@ ine freedom that is an in@@ dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ ble con@@ d@@ ition for peace .
in this respect , we are d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that both North and S@@ ou@@ th Korea have been on better terms for some time now .
this d@@ ri@@ ve to find peace is a s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of great hope for th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies that have been se@@ par@@ ated for h@@ al@@ f a c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
we must do all we can to encourage this change .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , we can but con@@ d@@ em@@ n the w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness , in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated in the resolution , to en@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ st the ta@@ s@@ k of man@@ ag@@ ing relations with C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Korea to the European Union rather than to Member States .
need we re@@ mind you that di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y is one of the re@@ g@@ al p@@ o@@ w@@ ers of every s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n state ?
each state is free to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with any other .
each n@@ ation should be able to re@@ ta@@ in the freedom to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t the f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy of its c@@ h@@ o@@ ice , the one most su@@ ited to its political and economic interests .
however , I s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the Community institutions , s@@ w@@ ol@@ l@@ en as they are with fin@@ e @-@ s@@ ou@@ n@@ ding but h@@ al@@ f @-@ b@@ a@@ k@@ ed pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , are ma@@ ture enough to deal with the re@@ al@@ ity .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es v@@ o@@ ting time .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded at 1@@ .@@ 3@@ 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 3 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
Council priorities for the meeting of the United N@@ ations Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a
the next it@@ e@@ m is the Council and Commission st@@ a@@ te@@ ments on the Council priorities for the meeting of the United N@@ ations Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the European Commission , I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that , at an e@@ ar@@ ly stage in the Swedish Presidency , the opportunity has already been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed to debate this important issue concerning the pre@@ par@@ ations for the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing meeting with the UN Human Rights Commission .
in the course of the debate , I shall , of course , follow c@@ a@@ re@@ fully the points of view put forward and in@@ ter@@ pre@@ t the mo@@ o@@ d of the A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly before the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed discussion to establish the EU &apos; s position .
the presidency &apos; s objective in the r@@ u@@ n @-@ up to this year &apos; s se@@ s@@ sion is to un@@ ite the EU be@@ h@@ in@@ d agreed p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons , to encourage the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries to back the EU &apos; s st@@ a@@ te@@ ments and res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions and , as far as at all possible , to m@@ u@@ st@@ er general support for the proposals - especially , this year , regarding the s@@ it@@ u@@ ations in I@@ r@@ an and C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
for under@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ able reasons , it is still un@@ clear quite how the Human Rights Commission &apos; s special se@@ s@@ sion on the situation in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st , held last a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n , is to be f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed up .
what is , however , clear is that the issue may be ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to become one of the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant issues during this year &apos; s se@@ s@@ sion and that the EU will be one of the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l pla@@ y@@ ers .
in M@@ ar@@ ch of last year , the Council re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed an as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the EU &apos; s human rights dialogue with C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to be adopted at the Council &apos; s meeting at the end of J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
these will defin@@ e the objectives of the dialogue and s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy the for@@ m@@ s to be taken both by the dialogue itself and by the re@@ gu@@ la@@ r as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments of the ou@@ t@@ come of the dialogue .
it is still un@@ clear whether a resolution on C@@ h@@ in@@ a is to be adopted in this year &apos; s se@@ s@@ sion .
the EU is in c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the United States , which was last year &apos; s pro@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ r .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to another issue that has att@@ ra@@ c@@ ted attention in the Human Rights Commission , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the resolution regarding the human rights situation in C@@ u@@ b@@ a , for which the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h R@@ e@@ public and P@@ ol@@ and to@@ o@@ k responsibility last year .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions on particular th@@ em@@ es , the EU will , in the future too , take responsibility for the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions concerning the rights of the ch@@ il@@ d and the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
where women &apos; s rights are concerned , the Human Rights Commission will be dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing upon a number of res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to which the EU is st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly com@@ m@@ it@@ ted , even though they are not EU initiatives .
it is as yet un@@ certain what initiatives will be re@@ qu@@ i@@ red from the EU when it comes to the Human Rights Commission &apos; s resolution concerning the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence A@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ st R@@ ac@@ is@@ m , while the EU &apos;s participation in the pre@@ par@@ ations for this W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence will un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly be one of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es during this si@@ x @-@ m@@ on@@ th per@@ i@@ o@@ d .
the so @-@ called om@@ n@@ i@@ b@@ us resolution on the rights of the ch@@ il@@ d , pre@@ pa@@ red in cooperation with the L@@ at@@ in A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an group , has unfortunately become so ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve that it has become al@@ most im@@ possible to deal with .
it is therefore the EU &apos; s a@@ m@@ b@@ ition to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the si@@ z@@ e of the resolution to a min@@ im@@ u@@ m and , in the process , make the rights per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l .
this a@@ m@@ b@@ ition is re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ed by the de@@ si@@ r@@ e to make a u@@ se@@ ful contribution to the pre@@ par@@ ations for the UN &apos; s special se@@ s@@ sion on children in S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er 2001 .
work in op@@ position to the death pen@@ al@@ ty is a priority issue for the EU &apos; s common f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy within the area of human rights , as may par@@ tly be seen from the EU &apos; s gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es adopted in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 .
an important fe@@ a@@ ture of this work is the Human Rights Commission &apos; s resolution concerning the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
the a@@ m@@ b@@ ition , this year too , is to achieve as st@@ r@@ on@@ g support as possible for this resolution .
an important pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for the EU &apos; s ac@@ tive in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in issues a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting human rights is good access to re@@ le@@ v@@ ant information .
in this area , the EU countries &apos; and the Commission &apos; s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the world have an important role to pla@@ y when it comes to g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ing information .
c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cooperation with p@@ ri@@ va@@ te organisations is a c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l f@@ ac@@ to@@ r , as is cooperation with regional organisations .
last but not least , the EU will continue to give every support to the UN &apos; s H@@ i@@ g@@ h Commissioner for Human Rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e , Mr P@@ att@@ en , who had to le@@ a@@ ve to go to M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w for a meeting , I should like to p@@ ra@@ ise Parliament for h@@ ol@@ ding this debate today , because it a@@ f@@ for@@ ds us a v@@ al@@ u@@ able opportunity for an ex@@ change of v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing Commission on Human Rights .
it is important that the v@@ i@@ e@@ ws of Parliament are taken into account , as the European Union wor@@ ks towards e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons on the main issues which will be co@@ v@@ e@@ red in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
new p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons on the initiatives in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a will only be finally de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed after l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , which are , of course , an in@@ te@@ gra@@ l part of the process .
N@@ G@@ O@@ s and others are right to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the u@@ se@@ f@@ ul@@ ness of discussion and s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y of the p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the presidency , the Commission services and se@@ ver@@ al Member States att@@ en@@ ded a meeting of the Human Rights C@@ on@@ ta@@ c@@ t Group held in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s on 1@@ 1 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
a w@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ an@@ ge of N@@ G@@ O@@ s g@@ o@@ t an opportunity to set out their v@@ i@@ e@@ ws with regard to key country and th@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c concerns and this in@@ put will no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t pro@@ ve h@@ el@@ p@@ ful to the d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ation process .
the 5@@ 6@@ th Commission on Human Rights of last year in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly had its high and l@@ o@@ w points .
the ad@@ op@@ tion of the resolution tabled by the European Union on the death pen@@ al@@ ty was a welcome ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement .
the European Union may re@@ p@@ e@@ at this mo@@ ve this year , re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ting the fact that the issue re@@ ma@@ in@@ s of par@@ a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t concern .
the Swedish Presidency has si@@ g@@ n@@ al@@ l@@ ed more g@@ en@@ er@@ ally that the efforts made by the European Union in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the death pen@@ al@@ ty will be con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed and in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fied .
there was dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment at the ad@@ op@@ tion of a no @-@ action motion on C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
some members of the Human Rights Commission voted against , making clear that such mo@@ tions can only s@@ er@@ ve to st@@ i@@ f@@ le discussion and under@@ min@@ e the very ra@@ is@@ on d &@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ ê@@ t@@ r@@ e of the g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ing .
as I have no@@ ted , decisions regarding EU res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions for this year &apos;s 5@@ 7@@ th Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a have not been fin@@ al@@ is@@ ed , as is u@@ su@@ al for this stage of the process .
the presidency and Member States are ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing the situation in se@@ ver@@ al countries , taking into account , where appropriate , the information from the United N@@ ations &apos; special ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s and other e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence available .
I will v@@ en@@ ture b@@ ri@@ e@@ f com@@ ments on some issues of interest which , whether or not they form part of an EU initiative , will d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less be to@@ p@@ ic@@ s of discussion for those att@@ en@@ ding the 5@@ 7@@ th Commission .
f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r concerns re@@ main with respect to C@@ h@@ in@@ a , concerns which continue to be he@@ ar@@ d as part of the EU @-@ C@@ h@@ in@@ a dialogue .
positive de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in recent m@@ on@@ th@@ s in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the si@@ g@@ nature of a m@@ em@@ or@@ an@@ d@@ u@@ m of under@@ st@@ an@@ ding on human rights with the United N@@ ations H@@ i@@ g@@ h Commissioner last N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er .
it is n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s essential that dialogue le@@ ad@@ s to con@@ c@@ re@@ te change , a point re@@ it@@ er@@ ated by the European Union in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a last year .
with this in mind , the human rights dialogue with C@@ h@@ in@@ a is currently the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t of an evaluation ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise which will le@@ a@@ d to the ad@@ op@@ tion of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons by the J@@ an@@ u@@ ary G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council .
they will form the basis for c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying forward the dialogue in a con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive and m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds I@@ r@@ an , the resolution adopted at the 5@@ 5@@ th se@@ s@@ sion of the G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k w@@ el@@ com@@ ed the positive ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in that country .
however , it also no@@ ted , with concern , con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es with regard to the re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion of f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s , the use of ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tions and t@@ or@@ ture and dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation di@@ rec@@ ted against re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous min@@ or@@ ities and women .
the in@@ te@@ ri@@ m report su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly last S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er by Mr C@@ op@@ i@@ th@@ or@@ n@@ e , the special re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive , re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted the need to in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ate the progress towards im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing human rights .
access by the special re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive re@@ ma@@ in@@ s , of course , a key pre@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ pa@@ tion .
finally , as a th@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c concern , children &apos;s issues will d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed@@ ly rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve much attention this year , not least at the special se@@ s@@ sion of the United N@@ ations G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed for S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er .
with this in mind , the European Union will continue to pla@@ y an ac@@ tive role in the resolution on children &apos;s rights at G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a and , as last year , will se@@ e@@ k the u@@ se@@ ful cooperation of the L@@ at@@ in A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an and the C@@ ar@@ i@@ b@@ be@@ an group .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President @-@ in @-@ Office and the Commissioner for their re@@ mar@@ ks . in particular for what they have had to say about the death pen@@ al@@ ty and the situation in C@@ h@@ in@@ a and I@@ r@@ an .
I only re@@ g@@ re@@ t that the wor@@ d R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a was not mentioned by either g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an because it o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ s to me that the situation in R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a is wor@@ r@@ ying .
this needs to be con@@ si@@ de@@ red by the Commission in particular if we are to look towards a sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y human rights situation in Europe as a whole .
with any l@@ u@@ c@@ k the ti@@ m@@ ing will be good and Mr P@@ att@@ en will be able to ra@@ ise certain qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons with the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an President .
it is very ti@@ m@@ el@@ y that this matter should come up because it is n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly t@@ en years since the c@@ ol@@ la@@ p@@ se of the S@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ t Union .
at that time we had very high h@@ op@@ es that the whole of Europe would become a human rights @-@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble z@@ one but of course things n@@ e@@ v@@ er t@@ u@@ r@@ n out ex@@ ac@@ tly as one h@@ op@@ es .
the situation in particular in B@@ y@@ el@@ or@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a has de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ated d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally and there have been the most h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble civil w@@ ar@@ s and ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res on a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve sc@@ al@@ e in the Balkans .
we must congratulate ourselves in Europe on some progress but not enough has been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
I am particularly ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to see what has o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red in P@@ ol@@ and , H@@ un@@ g@@ ary and the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h R@@ e@@ public .
the human rights situation in those countries has im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally and in the B@@ al@@ ti@@ c States with the b@@ u@@ il@@ d @-@ up of the m@@ i@@ x@@ ed economic system .
some people do not consider that to be a human right , but I believe in fact that it is and re@@ p@@ res@@ ents another st@@ e@@ p forward that we should welcome .
it mo@@ v@@ es me very de@@ e@@ p@@ ly every su@@ m@@ m@@ er to see in the res@@ or@@ ts of the Mediterranean and el@@ se@@ where large n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ ma@@ k@@ ers from e@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n and c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l Europe including R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a h@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ ying in the way that we have done for many dec@@ ad@@ es .
it is , as a B@@ r@@ it@@ ish F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y , E@@ r@@ n@@ est B@@ e@@ v@@ in , used to say , the main pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of a f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy to allow citizens to be able to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l with a min@@ im@@ u@@ m of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ence and an@@ no@@ y@@ ance .
I believe though that I should m@@ en@@ tion two or three of the particular problems of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a .
one of them is one in which I have a re@@ g@@ is@@ te@@ red interest , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the question of M@@ ed@@ i@@ a @-@ M@@ o@@ s@@ t , and the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on system of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a .
I hope that Mr P@@ att@@ en is well b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ed on the question of the present d@@ et@@ en@@ tion of the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of M@@ ed@@ i@@ a @-@ M@@ o@@ s@@ t , Mr V@@ la@@ d@@ im@@ i@@ r G@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ s@@ k@@ y .
he is rather sur@@ pr@@ is@@ in@@ g@@ ly in his h@@ ou@@ se n@@ e@@ a@@ r M@@ al@@ ag@@ a in S@@ pa@@ in .
I find it b@@ i@@ z@@ ar@@ r@@ e that the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e are f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ing a request made by the for@@ m@@ er K@@ G@@ B in this way .
the war on dis@@ s@@ ent con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es on the part of Mr P@@ u@@ t@@ in .
he se@@ em@@ s not to have a s@@ en@@ se of h@@ u@@ m@@ our .
he does not like to see h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f por@@ tra@@ y@@ ed on the te@@ le@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on by a g@@ l@@ o@@ ve pu@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t with j@@ o@@ k@@ es being made at his ex@@ pen@@ se .
it se@@ em@@ s that it is not appropriate for the President of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a to be la@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ on@@ ed in this way and so he will not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate it .
it is a most un@@ p@@ le@@ as@@ ant fe@@ u@@ d made all the more un@@ p@@ le@@ as@@ ant by the fact that one si@@ d@@ e is en@@ j@@ o@@ ying the support of the President of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a .
this is not sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y and I hope it will be de@@ al@@ t with during Mr P@@ att@@ en &apos;s v@@ is@@ it .
very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , the other points I would m@@ en@@ tion in respect of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a are the situation in the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an ar@@ my , in particular in C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , but also in@@ ter@@ n@@ ally because the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an ar@@ my is no@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ous these d@@ a@@ y@@ s for the c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty which it ex@@ er@@ ts and in particular the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of its young con@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
I have also w@@ at@@ ch@@ ed with concern in the past year the t@@ en@@ d@@ ency of the present le@@ ad@@ ers of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a - many of w@@ h@@ o@@ m are e@@ x @-@ K@@ G@@ B because they were ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by a for@@ m@@ er c@@ ol@@ on@@ e@@ l in the K@@ G@@ B - to be a little b@@ it t@@ ri@@ g@@ g@@ er @-@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ y in the ar@@ re@@ st of so @-@ called B@@ r@@ it@@ ish , A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an and R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an s@@ p@@ ies .
this is really something that is quite un@@ necessary I would have th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t in the p@@ o@@ s@@ t c@@ ol@@ d @-@ war environment .
so , with those res@@ er@@ va@@ tions I congratulate the Commission and the President @-@ in @-@ Office and look forward to an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in human rights in the com@@ ing year .
Mr President , last year I att@@ en@@ ded the 5@@ 6@@ th UN Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a and last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , I att@@ en@@ ded the Human Rights C@@ on@@ ta@@ c@@ t Group : much more needs to be done and , if an@@ y@@ th@@ ing , the situation is wor@@ s@@ en@@ ing ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the world .
the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion and de@@ f@@ ence of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and re@@ ma@@ in@@ s one of the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the Union .
indeed , I believe the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of human rights should in@@ for@@ m e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing we do in the n@@ a@@ me of democracy because a n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve human rights situation is often c@@ a@@ u@@ sed or ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by the ab@@ s@@ ence of democracy and in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent and cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t government st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
human rights do not ex@@ is@@ t in is@@ ol@@ ation , n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er should they be con@@ si@@ de@@ red in ab@@ st@@ ra@@ c@@ t .
they are the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l rights of all people re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of who they are , where or to w@@ h@@ o@@ m they are b@@ or@@ n .
yet as we speak in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , the human rights of men , women and children are being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated .
this is why the Council and the Member States must work for the uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l ra@@ ti@@ fication of the main human rights in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments available to all countries , in particular , the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ o@@ v@@ en@@ ant on C@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l and P@@ ol@@ it@@ ical Rights , the C@@ o@@ v@@ en@@ ant on E@@ con@@ om@@ ic , S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al and C@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l rights , the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on the E@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ation of all F@@ or@@ m@@ s of D@@ is@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation against W@@ om@@ en , the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on the Rights of the C@@ h@@ il@@ d , already mentioned , the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on the E@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ation of all for@@ m@@ s of R@@ ac@@ i@@ al D@@ is@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation and the extremely important C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion against T@@ or@@ ture .
we also call for im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate measures to be taken to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t h@@ om@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ al per@@ s@@ ons from de@@ gra@@ ding and in@@ human t@@ re@@ at@@ ment to which they are still su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted : because of their se@@ x@@ u@@ al@@ ity , they still f@@ ac@@ e the death pen@@ al@@ ty in certain par@@ ts of the world .
we also call on the EU to support the UN H@@ i@@ g@@ h Commissioner for Human Rights and the other international organisations and N@@ G@@ O@@ s in the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against re@@ p@@ res@@ sion of the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent m@@ ed@@ i@@ a already re@@ f@@ er@@ red to by L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l and the re@@ p@@ res@@ sion of j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s and w@@ r@@ it@@ ers and to ur@@ ge all st@@ a@@ tes to end c@@ en@@ s@@ or@@ sh@@ i@@ p , to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the right of access to o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al information and to st@@ o@@ p the re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion on access to m@@ od@@ er@@ n information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , often a sa@@ v@@ i@@ our to people being re@@ p@@ res@@ sed .
we also call upon the Council and the UN Commission on Human Rights to give full support to the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting of the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on the P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tion of A@@ l@@ l P@@ er@@ s@@ ons from E@@ n@@ for@@ c@@ ed D@@ is@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ an@@ c@@ es .
once again , and I hope not in va@@ in , we call for the ab@@ ol@@ ition of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
countries can , will and should be n@@ a@@ m@@ ed and s@@ ha@@ m@@ ed , but in this House and together with the Council and the UN Commission , we must re@@ d@@ ou@@ ble our efforts to ensure that men , women and children are b@@ or@@ n e@@ qu@@ al and can li@@ ve as e@@ qu@@ als , en@@ j@@ o@@ ying the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s of human rights .
that is the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge that this House must c@@ ar@@ r@@ y to the UN Commission on Human Rights in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a and I hope everyone in this House will support such an in@@ t@@ en@@ tion .
Mr President , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , the European Union is an important com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity of v@@ al@@ u@@ es st@@ an@@ ding for democracy , h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an@@ is@@ m and human rights .
this is the basis not only for our internal work but also for our f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy .
in many res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts , the EU has a good policy on human rights . what , however , is mis@@ sing is a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent strategy for the way in which the work on pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing this is to be carried out .
the various institutions are not always co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated and there is a lack of follow @-@ up and an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , and this , of course , re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es our in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence .
p@@ ri@@ or to the se@@ s@@ sion in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , I and the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party hope for a st@@ r@@ on@@ g and uni@@ fied Europe which will v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ou@@ s@@ ly pu@@ r@@ su@@ e a number of issues .
it was good to he@@ a@@ r of the a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons of the Swedish Presidency here today .
it is good that the Council su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the resolution on the death pen@@ al@@ ty and on the rights of the ch@@ il@@ d and of women .
on behalf of the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party , I would also call upon the Council to support the d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up of pro@@ to@@ c@@ ol@@ s to the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion A@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ st T@@ or@@ ture , as well as to support a new international con@@ v@@ en@@ tion concerning those who have dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d .
the issue of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es must also be raised .
v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in many countries .
these must always be c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised , and when they o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in EU countries too .
in certain countries , the situation is al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , however .
I really want to ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the Council to t@@ r@@ y to bring about a resolution on C@@ h@@ in@@ a , where ou@@ tra@@ g@@ es against C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e citizens are b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing wor@@ se and wor@@ se , especially v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence against F@@ al@@ u@@ n G@@ on@@ g members , which has been st@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ed up .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council mentioned I@@ r@@ an and C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
I should also like to ad@@ d S@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ i A@@ ra@@ b@@ i@@ a , C@@ ol@@ om@@ b@@ i@@ a , In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a and A@@ f@@ g@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ ta@@ n .
in these countries , too , the situation is very al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
both the UN and the EU are important v@@ o@@ ic@@ es in the international debate .
many countries l@@ is@@ t@@ en and take no@@ te of si@@ g@@ n@@ als from &apos; B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s &apos; .
we can make use of this position to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y for human rights .
it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ency , c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge and a more th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly wor@@ k@@ ed out strategy .
I hope that the Swedish Presidency can help for@@ m@@ u@@ late such a strategy , not only p@@ ri@@ or to G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a but also for the future , which is a natural ar@@ en@@ a for the EU &apos; s f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy .
Mr President , human rights are an in@@ se@@ par@@ able part of the basis of human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and law in the Union .
they are also uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , despite certain di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s .
however , the EU will have no human rights strategy w@@ h@@ il@@ st the responsibility con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to re@@ main pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y with the Member States .
as there is no strategy , ta@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ s then become the strategy .
with human rights that means that political ex@@ p@@ ed@@ i@@ ency might d@@ ic@@ ta@@ te where and when to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e when v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations are o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing .
to some ex@@ t@@ ent that is in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able .
a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity based on respect for , and de@@ f@@ ence of , human rights , such as the EU , should , however , be able to achieve a more con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent , de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed policy on human rights than is the case at present .
it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble if the Union had a common v@@ o@@ ice in this important area .
for that reason the opportunity we now have well be@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ hand to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the Council &apos; s priorities in the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing meeting of the United N@@ ations Human Rights Commission is a welcome one .
human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations must be taken s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly at all ti@@ m@@ es and not just when a political ex@@ c@@ use is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
human rights have in@@ t@@ r@@ in@@ si@@ c v@@ al@@ u@@ e , which b@@ ec@@ om@@ es b@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ red when they are used as a to@@ o@@ l to achieve other , perhaps quite le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te objectives in themselves , in in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al cases , or when g@@ ro@@ s@@ s v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations are k@@ e@@ p@@ t qu@@ i@@ e@@ t about for p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ o @-@ com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al , or other , reasons .
this is a t@@ en@@ d@@ ency that can also be dis@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ ed in our approach to the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons on the Human Rights Commission &apos; s agenda , re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally , n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally and with regard to the issues themselves .
for example , su@@ p@@ p@@ res@@ sion of the freedom of s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h or t@@ or@@ ture with the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s going un@@ pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed , which A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national has rec@@ ently c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ed against , d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve to be l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed into more th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly .
a@@ d h@@ o@@ c action is not enough , then , but n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er must human rights m@@ e@@ re@@ ly be a r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ical s@@ w@@ e@@ et@@ en@@ er present e@@ ver@@ y@@ where , like a political &apos; N@@ u@@ tra@@ S@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ t &apos; , with no real p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al effect .
for the EU &apos; s v@@ o@@ ice to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y further and more a@@ u@@ di@@ b@@ ly it must have a con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent policy , one that is g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y its own , and must f@@ ir@@ m up its work in this area .
In@@ ter@@ in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al cooperation should therefore become more v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ous in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent .
above all , we here in Parliament should also ac@@ ti@@ va@@ te and h@@ on@@ our our r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ical com@@ m@@ it@@ ments .
that means long @-@ term , s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in human rights work when it is not di@@ rec@@ tly con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its to be g@@ a@@ in@@ ed or current e@@ v@@ ents co@@ v@@ e@@ red by the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a .
we have to make the re@@ por@@ ting and monitoring process more effective , which will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e not only good will but also a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate resources and di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness .
non @-@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l organisations and civil s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es are s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es of in@@ dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ ble help .
they can also bring a b@@ re@@ at@@ h of f@@ res@@ h a@@ i@@ r to that va@@ c@@ u@@ u@@ m in which we b@@ u@@ s@@ y about far too much with matters of only rather n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w , to@@ p@@ ical interest .
Mr President , Mr V@@ it@@ or@@ in@@ o , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , in pre@@ par@@ ing a resolution on a subject like human rights , there are in fact two p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities : we can state pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es and a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d n@@ a@@ m@@ ing specific areas ; or we can do as we have in fact done , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y n@@ a@@ me a number of specific areas and so r@@ u@@ n the r@@ is@@ k of for@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing some things .
that is par@@ tly what this s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h is about .
however , I want first of all to say that I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d indeed that something about the situation in C@@ h@@ in@@ a has been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded , and I want he@@ ar@@ ti@@ ly to support the amendments tabled .
something ou@@ g@@ h@@ t perhaps also to have been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded about the situation regarding re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous freedom for the F@@ al@@ u@@ n G@@ on@@ g se@@ c@@ t , but it was not .
there is n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s some quite sh@@ ar@@ p c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m , and I am very g@@ la@@ d about that .
I am also p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a has been mentioned .
I think this is an area to which we do not pa@@ y enough attention .
it is an area which may yet become a p@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ er k@@ e@@ g for security policy in that area , and perhaps also in our own area .
there are some areas to which I think too little priority has been given .
the Swedish Presidency sa@@ y@@ s that it will give high priority to the work done towards ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
I am extremely p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d about that , and I very much agree that this is an area to which high priority should be given .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , we need to k@@ e@@ e@@ p our e@@ y@@ es on our so @-@ called f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds .
I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States .
following the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ al el@@ ec@@ tion , the number of death s@@ ent@@ ences carried out in the United States will re@@ ac@@ h rec@@ or@@ d levels .
we are in a situation in which there are people on death ro@@ w in the United States who , we are quite con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed , have not been given f@@ a@@ i@@ r t@@ ri@@ als , n@@ or who will in fact be given f@@ a@@ i@@ r t@@ ri@@ als un@@ less ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e p@@ o@@ w@@ ers help them , for the system will not of itself pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce these .
I also think we have to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er another of our &apos; f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds &apos; , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y Turkey - an ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant country - which we do not m@@ en@@ tion at all in this resolution .
it is a problem that we still have a country so c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to us which will not ab@@ ol@@ ish the death pen@@ al@@ ty , which will not in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce general d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c rights for e@@ th@@ n@@ i@@ c min@@ or@@ ities and which has not ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red control over the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s its p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e use , either on the st@@ re@@ e@@ t or in its j@@ a@@ il@@ s .
Turkey does not com@@ p@@ ly with the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion A@@ g@@ a@@ in@@ st T@@ or@@ ture .
by e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a F@@ or@@ t@@ res@@ s Europe , we are not doing much to help those people who f@@ le@@ e from countries of that t@@ y@@ p@@ e , and allow me , in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , to say to the Swedish Presidency , &apos; R@@ em@@ em@@ b@@ er , we do not improve the situation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es by b@@ u@@ il@@ ding a F@@ or@@ t@@ res@@ s Europe ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d ourselves . &apos;
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the v@@ i@@ e@@ ws of our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w members are clear .
Mrs M@@ al@@ m@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m and Mrs F@@ ra@@ h@@ m have just s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en on the subject of C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e about C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
however , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you re@@ f@@ er to the Union &apos; s con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s position .
we know from ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence that the Union &apos; s con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s position is the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d that you have come up with in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d ad@@ op@@ ting any serious position in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
we already sa@@ w this last year , when the Union h@@ i@@ d be@@ h@@ in@@ d the United States and other countries until the last moment in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d ad@@ op@@ ting any real initiative on C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a and on the P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s R@@ e@@ public of C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
unfortunately , I fe@@ a@@ r that my own par@@ ty , the ra@@ d@@ ical par@@ ty , will again this year be one of the only parties , al@@ on@@ g with W@@ e@@ i J@@ in@@ sh@@ en@@ g and a few others , to speak up for the issue of human rights in C@@ h@@ in@@ a and T@@ i@@ b@@ e@@ t ; who will bring the issue of C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a to the for@@ e , while the Council , and the European Union which it re@@ p@@ res@@ ents , will again be ab@@ s@@ ent from the United N@@ ations .
you will be working on the matter of the death pen@@ al@@ ty , k@@ no@@ w@@ ing full well that this issue today concerns the United N@@ ations G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly and the Commission on Human Rights and , th@@ us , once again you will be h@@ i@@ d@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d fin@@ e pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es in , if I may say so , a rather h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ical m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
Mr President , in pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous de@@ b@@ a@@ tes on the human rights situation I have ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ated re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly that the European Union should take more pre@@ v@@ en@@ tive action and res@@ p@@ on@@ d more ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly to c@@ r@@ is@@ es .
it therefore sur@@ pr@@ ised me s@@ om@@ e@@ what not to he@@ a@@ r either the presidency or the Commission b@@ re@@ a@@ the a wor@@ d about the human rights situation in A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a just now in the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion .
that is why I shall make b@@ ol@@ d to start out by d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing attention to a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly to@@ p@@ ical situation , and one which is p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ ally very ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ si@@ ve on the human rights f@@ r@@ on@@ t , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the situation in C@@ on@@ g@@ o following the as@@ sa@@ s@@ s@@ in@@ ation of President K@@ ab@@ il@@ a .
despite con@@ f@@ using , and often con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ting information , it is gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally d@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ ing on us that there is a r@@ is@@ k of a power va@@ c@@ u@@ u@@ m de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing in K@@ in@@ s@@ ha@@ s@@ a .
that is why it is so important to qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y ur@@ ge the new le@@ ad@@ ers to do all they p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly can to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in c@@ al@@ m and s@@ er@@ en@@ ity in K@@ in@@ s@@ ha@@ s@@ a and to respect human rights .
at the same time , I believe all those countries that are involved in the conflict , be it di@@ rec@@ tly or in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , must be ur@@ g@@ ed in no un@@ certain terms not to in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ e in the current internal crisis .
if the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing countries do not li@@ e l@@ o@@ w then the crisis could e@@ s@@ c@@ al@@ ate further , with all the consequences this might en@@ ta@@ i@@ l .
it is important for the th@@ re@@ a@@ d of the L@@ u@@ sa@@ k@@ a peace process to be p@@ ic@@ k@@ ed up qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly though , and for the in@@ ter @-@ C@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ e@@ s@@ e dialogue to be able to start , with the cooperation of all concerned .
I say that with the R@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ an g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 in mind , when the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity had to w@@ it@@ ness the m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ er of h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people , which pr@@ om@@ p@@ ts me to pu@@ s@@ h for more as@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s from the European Union , and greater al@@ er@@ t@@ ness , also on the part of the UN , where C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a is concerned .
this b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to the agenda of the UN Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
no@@ t@@ w@@ i@@ th@@ st@@ an@@ ding the n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es and con@@ v@@ en@@ tions , the rights of women , children and other v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able groups are still being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated on a h@@ u@@ ge sc@@ al@@ e .
throughout the world , one w@@ om@@ an in three su@@ f@@ f@@ ers p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al ab@@ use .
fi@@ f@@ ty million children work in un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble conditions and two million g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s b@@ el@@ o@@ w the age of fi@@ f@@ te@@ en are for@@ c@@ ed into pro@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion every year .
I would like to ask that special attention be given to two for@@ m@@ s of human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations that have taken on al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing pro@@ por@@ tions in Europe over the last few years .
firstly , there is the p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on of pa@@ ed@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ i@@ a and ch@@ il@@ d por@@ no@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y .
w@@ h@@ il@@ st we ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise A@@ si@@ an countries because they allow ch@@ il@@ d la@@ b@@ our , or A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ an countries because of their ch@@ il@@ d s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , we are re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed here in W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe by pa@@ ed@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ i@@ a and ch@@ il@@ d por@@ n s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ als .
I would like to draw your attention to the excellent report by Mr K@@ ir@@ k@@ hope on the subject .
two new re@@ v@@ el@@ ations s@@ how how serious the situation is .
a n@@ et@@ work of people o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing p@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ s of se@@ x and ac@@ ts of c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty with children v@@ i@@ a the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t was r@@ ou@@ n@@ ded up in I@@ t@@ al@@ y rec@@ ently .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in s@@ h@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing the W@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ land c@@ l@@ u@@ b down , se@@ i@@ z@@ ing 7@@ 5@@ 0 000 de@@ gra@@ ding p@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ s of children in the process .
a second dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is that of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s .
every year , ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 3@@ 0 million or so people are s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ led into other countries , h@@ al@@ f a million of w@@ h@@ o@@ m end up in the European Union .
tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s has become a very l@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ tive international industry , often r@@ is@@ king the li@@ v@@ es of the pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers .
so many cor@@ p@@ ses of d@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ ed il@@ le@@ g@@ als get w@@ a@@ sh@@ ed up on S@@ p@@ an@@ ish be@@ ac@@ h@@ es that it has s@@ par@@ k@@ ed o@@ f@@ f a ma@@ c@@ ab@@ r@@ e debate as to who should pa@@ y for the b@@ u@@ ri@@ als .
in both cases , the d@@ e@@ s@@ per@@ ation of p@@ o@@ or people is being ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited by un@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ pu@@ l@@ ous money @-@ gra@@ b@@ b@@ ers .
in both cases there is a need for information to be pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed in the countries of or@@ i@@ g@@ in , and for co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between international p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e for@@ c@@ es , in a b@@ i@@ d to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le these ab@@ u@@ se@@ s .
Sweden has a good re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion when it comes to de@@ f@@ en@@ ding human rights in the world .
I really hope that Sweden will do its re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion full j@@ u@@ st@@ ice over the next si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s and put all its efforts into the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations that Parliament has for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted in these two important areas .
Mr President , the UN Commission on Human Rights is not just a discussion for@@ u@@ m but also an ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment for the dis@@ se@@ min@@ ation and de@@ f@@ ence of human rights .
U@@ n@@ d@@ en@@ i@@ ab@@ ly , the com@@ position of the Commission and the d@@ u@@ b@@ i@@ ous s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity between m@@ em@@ b@@ er st@@ a@@ tes who have little respect for human rights often pre@@ v@@ ent us ad@@ op@@ ting clear @-@ c@@ u@@ t , d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , or even any con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion at all .
however , the very fact that a serious b@@ re@@ ac@@ h of human rights in a United N@@ ations m@@ em@@ b@@ er state should be mentioned at G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a is really a political fact in itself .
the countries on the rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing end of the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m dec@@ r@@ y &quot; n@@ a@@ me c@@ al@@ l@@ ing &quot; and are l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ ying h@@ ar@@ d in ad@@ v@@ ance to pre@@ v@@ ent any discussion , and this is ex@@ ac@@ tly where the European Parliament , being so com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the de@@ f@@ ence of human rights , can fully pla@@ y its part .
in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant N@@ G@@ O@@ s , and particularly with A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national and the human rights le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , Parliament can ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the Council and Member States in order to in@@ s@@ is@@ t that , in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , the F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en present well @-@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded common p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons on priority issues .
for 2001 , the priority issues that I believe should be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a are , first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most , the death pen@@ al@@ ty , t@@ or@@ ture , for@@ m@@ s of dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation against women , f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to respect children &apos; s rights , freedom of the p@@ res@@ s and freedom of information .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g recent for@@ m@@ s of human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations , the in@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ ance or ex@@ tra@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ i@@ al ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion , often p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ed by t@@ or@@ ture , are particularly d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ able .
the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s are un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly always political op@@ p@@ on@@ ents of the re@@ g@@ im@@ es in power .
these v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations , against which there is no possible ap@@ p@@ e@@ al , have been rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed in the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation ( in relation to C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a ) , in S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one , In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a , C@@ ol@@ om@@ b@@ i@@ a , I@@ r@@ an and I@@ ra@@ q , in P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ ed by I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l and in Turkey , a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st other pla@@ c@@ es .
I could go on and on .
this l@@ is@@ t is long but it is not com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve .
Parliament will do itself c@@ re@@ d@@ it by d@@ em@@ an@@ ding that the governments of Europe adopt a f@@ ir@@ m position on this issue .
we have just ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the new C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights .
we must ac@@ t in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with our pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es .
the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s &apos; f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies are a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing our action .
Mr President , it is more than 5@@ 0 years since we adopted the D@@ ec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation of Human Rights , but we pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly need to ask ourselves whether the human rights situation has in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed .
that is not an e@@ as@@ y question to an@@ s@@ w@@ er , but we know more today than we once did , th@@ an@@ ks par@@ tly to the many N@@ G@@ O@@ s and j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s who con@@ st@@ an@@ tly report on human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the world , and k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge is a pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for action .
but there is , in fact , an ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to ac@@ t upon information , so that not to do an@@ y@@ th@@ ing is to let down those w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e rights are being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated , and in this area the EU has an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent responsibility .
as many s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have mentioned , the EU has quite a high prof@@ il@@ e in the area of human rights , and that is both a good and a b@@ a@@ d th@@ ing .
it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al that we are con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent and specific .
in relation to C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n European countries , we have had su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s with our policy , which can pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly best be ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised as an ir@@ on f@@ is@@ t in a v@@ el@@ v@@ e@@ t g@@ l@@ o@@ ve .
however , that is not enough , for human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations do not , of course , st@@ o@@ p at Europe &apos; s b@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
therefore , it is also gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that we have f@@ o@@ c@@ used on human rights in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the new A@@ C@@ P @-@ EU par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
however , we must be certain that we are in a position to follow through and take action if it pro@@ v@@ es that human rights are being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated .
if we have to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce s@@ an@@ c@@ tions in C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe , then everyone will be a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
the situation of the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries is quite different in this respect .
if we are ob@@ li@@ ged to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce s@@ an@@ c@@ tions , which more often than not will only a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the p@@ o@@ or sector of the population , we therefore need , where de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries are concerned , to establish a special strategy with regard to s@@ an@@ c@@ tions so that we do not only h@@ it those we really w@@ an@@ ted to help , as well as those who have su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red in the past .
this con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a very large ta@@ s@@ k for the EU as a whole and also for the European Parliament .
we must be clear which s@@ an@@ c@@ tions are to be im@@ p@@ o@@ sed .
however , it is of course c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for us to work with human rights more g@@ en@@ er@@ ally so that we can ob@@ ta@@ in some com@@ par@@ able fi@@ gu@@ res , for Parliament is in@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ed to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e as s@@ o@@ on as we he@@ a@@ r that a human right is being v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated s@@ om@@ e@@ where or other .
when we go out into the world , we must t@@ r@@ y to be very specific and see what the human rights situation is like in the countries concerned . we can or@@ g@@ an@@ ise m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s with human rights ac@@ ti@@ v@@ is@@ t@@ s and human rights organisations in the area and we can ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge for the fin@@ al report to deal with human rights issues .
I should like , in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , to say that those areas de@@ al@@ t with in the resolution are important , but that they are not , of course , the only areas d@@ em@@ an@@ ding our attention .
that is why I have t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ed upon a number of other areas today .
Mr President , I would like to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on three issues in this debate on the pre@@ par@@ ation of the an@@ n@@ u@@ al human rights con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , and the European Union &apos; s role in this .
I would like to say a few things about the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a , and in In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a , and about the ch@@ il@@ d s@@ ol@@ di@@ er p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
it is already al@@ most t@@ en years since A@@ un@@ g S@@ an S@@ u@@ u K@@ y@@ i was ch@@ o@@ s@@ en as President of B@@ ur@@ m@@ a and the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e Parliament received a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of her par@@ ty , the N@@ L@@ D .
since then , B@@ ur@@ m@@ a has been su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing under a military d@@ ic@@ ta@@ t@@ or@@ sh@@ i@@ p , s@@ co@@ res of M@@ P@@ s have been m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ red or have f@@ led , and there is t@@ al@@ k of un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted ac@@ ts of ter@@ ro@@ r being com@@ m@@ it@@ ted against political op@@ p@@ on@@ ents and min@@ or@@ ities .
I have long been a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of P@@ i@@ d@@ i @-@ B@@ ur@@ m@@ a , a group under the le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of for@@ m@@ er P@@ re@@ m@@ i@@ er B@@ on@@ de@@ v@@ i@@ k of N@@ or@@ way , and I have v@@ is@@ ited the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e c@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s of the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and .
I have a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h idea of what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing in the country .
I now he@@ a@@ r that there is a p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of t@@ al@@ ks between A@@ un@@ g S@@ an S@@ u@@ u K@@ y@@ i and the military com@@ m@@ and , and that next m@@ on@@ th , a d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation from the European Union under the le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of Sweden is going to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l to B@@ ur@@ m@@ a .
however , be@@ w@@ are of being led up the g@@ ar@@ d@@ en p@@ at@@ h .
the military re@@ g@@ im@@ e out there has made so @-@ called con@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons before , which la@@ ter pro@@ v@@ ed to be ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly wor@@ th@@ less , and this often ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed just before an EU @-@ A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , or just before the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
our ad@@ v@@ ice is p@@ le@@ a@@ se k@@ e@@ e@@ p a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly c@@ r@@ it@@ ical resolution about B@@ ur@@ m@@ a to hand in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a and do not have any qu@@ al@@ m@@ s about pu@@ sh@@ ing for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment f@@ re@@ e@@ z@@ es or s@@ an@@ c@@ tions on that f@@ r@@ on@@ t .
I em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e this point not because I am any particular f@@ an of s@@ an@@ c@@ tions , but if there is one country that does d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve them , it is B@@ ur@@ m@@ a .
then there is In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a , a country in the m@@ i@@ d@@ st of a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ t@@ is@@ ation process and where the government is having to deal with t@@ ou@@ g@@ h op@@ position .
the country is f@@ ac@@ ing en@@ or@@ m@@ ous problems in a number of regions such as A@@ c@@ e@@ h , the M@@ ol@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ as , I@@ ri@@ an J@@ a@@ y@@ a and T@@ im@@ or .
by all ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts , more than a million people have now f@@ led and t@@ en@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds have been k@@ il@@ led or w@@ ou@@ n@@ ded .
D@@ is@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers and f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t M@@ u@@ s@@ li@@ m groups are ma@@ in@@ ly the on@@ es to b@@ la@@ me for serious v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights .
the government is not doing enough about it and so a resolution in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a would be both b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al and necessary .
the idea would not be to at@@ ta@@ c@@ k the W@@ a@@ h@@ i@@ d government , but to ur@@ ge it to deal with the human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y and bring the c@@ ul@@ pr@@ its to j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , I would like to draw attention to the g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing problem , particularly in A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a , of the ch@@ il@@ d s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers , who are in@@ c@@ ited to com@@ m@@ it the most ter@@ ri@@ ble , d@@ r@@ u@@ g @-@ in@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed ac@@ ts .
we see e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of this in the S@@ u@@ d@@ an , and S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one , and the p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on is also on the increase in a number of other countries .
what we are t@@ al@@ king about here is a d@@ ou@@ ble human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation .
first , these children are ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted , and then they are b@@ ra@@ in@@ w@@ a@@ sh@@ ed , using d@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ s and other te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es , into ma@@ im@@ ing and m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ er@@ ing people .
and when I look at the re@@ g@@ im@@ e in S@@ u@@ d@@ an , I feel this w@@ ar@@ r@@ an@@ ts ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m because it ad@@ m@@ its these groups to its ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n S@@ u@@ d@@ an in order to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on a re@@ i@@ g@@ n of ter@@ ro@@ r in U@@ g@@ an@@ d@@ a .
these groups also ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s from sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s in n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n U@@ g@@ an@@ d@@ a for special services .
what this in fact means is that these children su@@ f@@ f@@ er a t@@ ri@@ p@@ le in@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need for a ro@@ b@@ u@@ st st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on these p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , as I see it , and I also call upon the European Union to ta@@ ble a resolution in this v@@ e@@ in .
Mr President , n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally I support the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of C@@ h@@ in@@ a with regard to T@@ i@@ b@@ e@@ t , of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a with regard to C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , and I en@@ d@@ or@@ se the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m v@@ o@@ ic@@ ed in relation to the human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations in the conflict between I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l and the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans , also when it comes to the re@@ pu@@ g@@ n@@ ant public l@@ y@@ n@@ ch@@ in@@ g@@ s that are carried out .
I ap@@ pro@@ ve of the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m le@@ v@@ el@@ led at I@@ r@@ an and its lack of re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous freedom , freedom for women and p@@ res@@ s freedom , but do not for@@ get B@@ ur@@ m@@ a and In@@ d@@ on@@ e@@ si@@ a and the ch@@ il@@ d s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
that was the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge I particularly w@@ an@@ ted to get ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s .
Mr President , last year , only a few v@@ o@@ tes pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted the in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing human @-@ rights ab@@ u@@ se@@ s in C@@ h@@ in@@ a on the agenda in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
I hope we can be more su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful in the com@@ ing m@@ on@@ th@@ s in w@@ in@@ n@@ ing over countries that will be re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted on the Commission on Human Rights at its 5@@ 7@@ th se@@ s@@ sion .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k@@ en@@ d , in my role as c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the T@@ i@@ b@@ e@@ t In@@ ter@@ group of the European Parliament , I att@@ en@@ ded a con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land , where par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ans from the EU Member States , the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries and the United States dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed w@@ a@@ y@@ s of in@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing their res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive countries to ra@@ ise the issue of C@@ h@@ in@@ a &apos;s g@@ ro@@ s@@ s v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights .
these ab@@ u@@ se@@ s not only a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the T@@ i@@ b@@ et@@ ans but the U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ur@@ s and M@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ s too .
free s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , freedom of as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly and freedom of movement are su@@ p@@ p@@ res@@ sed .
the T@@ i@@ b@@ et@@ ans cannot p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ise their own re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ on or c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ ra@@ te their own c@@ ul@@ ture and certainly cannot en@@ g@@ age in a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ous political ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
T@@ E@@ N@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of them have been su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion , im@@ pr@@ is@@ on@@ ment and t@@ or@@ ture .
a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ed c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n is being con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted with a view to con@@ ver@@ ting B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ t b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ ver@@ s into a@@ th@@ e@@ is@@ t@@ s .
we cannot c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e our e@@ y@@ es to this second cultural re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
I am not un@@ aware , Commissioner V@@ it@@ or@@ in@@ o , of the dialogue between the European Union and C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
n@@ or am I un@@ aware of the role pla@@ y@@ ed by C@@ h@@ in@@ a as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the W@@ T@@ O and a future g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al power .
at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts are being made to deal more s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y with major tra@@ ding par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that , some day , the ol@@ d gu@@ ar@@ d of b@@ l@@ in@@ k@@ e@@ red c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ t le@@ ad@@ ers will be re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by new re@@ for@@ mis@@ t el@@ em@@ ents .
but we cannot w@@ a@@ it until that day finally d@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ s .
we cannot be pa@@ s@@ si@@ ve on@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ers and f@@ a@@ i@@ l these ma@@ s@@ ses of people who are being su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to m@@ en@@ ta@@ l and p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty .
human rights are not a W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n in@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
the new ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents between the European Union and third countries ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly st@@ i@@ pu@@ late that con@@ tra@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ al ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations will be su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded in the e@@ v@@ ent of either par@@ ty &apos;s f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to respect human rights .
we therefore ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the Council and Member States of the EU to take the initiative in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a this time ; as you said , Mr D@@ an@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ s@@ on , we are one of the key pla@@ y@@ ers .
al@@ on@@ g with the United States , C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and , as I have le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed , S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land and the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries for acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion to the EU , we should t@@ r@@ y to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce the countries of A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a , A@@ si@@ a and S@@ ou@@ th A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a that it is high time the subject of C@@ h@@ in@@ a was put on the agenda in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
human rights are not of se@@ con@@ d@@ ary importance . human rights are uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to say thank you for the st@@ r@@ on@@ g support which I understand that this A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly and its h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members have given to positive action by the European Union in the course of the Commission &apos; s for@@ th@@ com@@ ing meeting in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
I would also thank you for the many p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al points of view which have been p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in the debate .
allow me to com@@ ment on a few of them .
first of all , R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a and , more s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally , C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
L@@ or@@ d B@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ l is right . it was C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a and not R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a that I mentioned .
I just want to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that it is the Council &apos; s view that the situation in C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a is still serious .
it cannot perhaps be said to be as ur@@ g@@ ent as it has been in pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous years , but it is our j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ement that we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to follow up the resolution p@@ res@@ en@@ ted and adopted last year because of the serious situation in C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
we have not therefore in any way for@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ en this important issue .
a number of s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the situation in C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
I want defin@@ it@@ el@@ y to re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate no@@ tions to the effect that the European Union is t@@ r@@ ying to h@@ i@@ d@@ e be@@ h@@ in@@ d other countries when it comes to com@@ b@@ ating v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights in C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
at the same time , it is important that , when we do something about the human rights situation in C@@ h@@ in@@ a , we can in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact bring together a su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently large group of countries in the UN Human Rights Commission in order to achieve some progress .
there are problems here , to which many of the Members re@@ f@@ er@@ red in their s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es .
right now , we are en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in a dialogue with C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
there will be an opportunity here next m@@ on@@ th to have a discussion with the C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e about how the European Union v@@ i@@ e@@ ws the situation .
however , we also need to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t further dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with the in@@ com@@ ing ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion in the United States because the United States is tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally the pro@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ r and has been so where this resolution is concerned .
I can therefore pr@@ om@@ ise the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members that the European Union is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to pa@@ y attention to the situation in C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
Mrs F@@ ra@@ h@@ m dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the issue of the death pen@@ al@@ ty , which is in@@ c@@ re@@ di@@ b@@ ly important .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , the European Union must d@@ is@@ t@@ ance itself from the death pen@@ al@@ ty w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er it is used - including , of course , in the United States .
I am particularly gra@@ te@@ ful that Mr J@@ o@@ h@@ an V@@ an H@@ ec@@ k@@ e and others have dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the human rights situation in A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a and am only s@@ or@@ r@@ y that I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f did not do so in my in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h . it is , of course , not only a question of concern about human rights .
rather , we all know that , in many A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ an countries , the problems are more de@@ e@@ p @-@ se@@ ated . it is not , therefore , only human rights that are the problem .
that must not , of course , pre@@ v@@ ent us from pa@@ ying attention to the problems that ex@@ is@@ t .
I can pr@@ om@@ ise Mr J@@ o@@ h@@ an V@@ an H@@ ec@@ k@@ e that the European Union will take c@@ a@@ re@@ ful account of what has been said in this debate where A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a in particular is concerned .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , a few words about the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
this year too , the European Union is pre@@ par@@ ing a proposal concerning the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r , to be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted at the meeting of the Human Rights Commission .
it can only be seen as one el@@ ement in a general strategy for dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the human rights situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
for example , Sweden has for many years been responsible for a resolution in the UN &apos; s G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly about the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r , and the European Union as a whole is ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons in the In@@ ter@@ national L@@ ab@@ our O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation ( I@@ L@@ O ) when it comes to the fact that for@@ c@@ ed la@@ b@@ our still ex@@ is@@ t@@ s in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a .
a r@@ an@@ ge of measures have been mo@@ o@@ ted there , which the European Union st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly su@@ p@@ por@@ ts .
I would therefore ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my th@@ an@@ ks for all the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al points of view and pr@@ om@@ ise to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de them in the Council &apos; s con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ations p@@ ri@@ or to the Human Rights Commission &apos; s important meeting in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a la@@ ter this year .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , ladies and gentlemen , let me very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly say and re@@ it@@ er@@ ate that the Commission will fully take into account the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed by the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ans and em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e that in my p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion I did not t@@ ou@@ ch upon all the su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts that could be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
that is why this debate today is extremely important , as is the par@@ al@@ le@@ l debate with the N@@ G@@ O@@ s , so that we can g@@ a@@ th@@ er as much information as possible and in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate it in the position of the European Union in pre@@ par@@ ation for the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights .
a few con@@ c@@ re@@ te words on some of the re@@ mar@@ ks .
first of all , ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing Mr T@@ h@@ om@@ as M@@ an@@ n , I em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e once again that the Commission is l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ating the dialogue on human rights with C@@ h@@ in@@ a and we hope to see con@@ c@@ re@@ te con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons from that evaluation at the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council this m@@ on@@ th , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office said .
in our concerns , of course , we did not for@@ get A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a , or R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a , or B@@ ur@@ m@@ a , or even some h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on@@ ta@@ l issues which are extremely important , like the protection of min@@ or@@ ities , dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation of all k@@ in@@ ds or the ab@@ ol@@ ition of t@@ or@@ ture - I think those are rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent concerns as far as de@@ f@@ en@@ ding human rights is concerned .
I would con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de by em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ing that we place great em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on pre@@ par@@ ing the position of the European Union for the UN G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly on C@@ h@@ il@@ d@@ r@@ en &apos;s Rights , and I welcome the w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness of the Swedish Presidency to take this position very s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly in S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er .
let me also te@@ l@@ l Mr V@@ an H@@ ec@@ k@@ e that I fully share his concerns about the th@@ re@@ at of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s .
may I re@@ mind you that the Commission has just adopted two proposals for framework decisions , one a@@ im@@ ing to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s for se@@ x@@ u@@ al ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation and the other to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s for economic ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation .
these will be two important pen@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise the legislation to com@@ b@@ at c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al t@@ r@@ ans @-@ national n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks that ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s .
we are in the le@@ a@@ d in ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e and the j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ i@@ ary of the fi@@ f@@ te@@ en Member States the necessary h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised legal in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against those th@@ re@@ at@@ s to human rights and to st@@ ability in the 1@@ 5 Member States .
thank you very much , Commissioner V@@ it@@ or@@ in@@ o .
I have received se@@ v@@ en mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , pu@@ r@@ su@@ ant to R@@ u@@ le 3@@ 7 ( 2 ) of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day , at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded at 4@@ .@@ 1@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 4@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , pen@@ ding the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment by the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council )
programme of the Swedish Presidency
it is my very great p@@ le@@ a@@ sure to welcome Mr P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on , the Swedish P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would like to say that it is an h@@ on@@ our to welcome you to the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er for the first time , for the start of the Swedish Presidency , W@@ e wish you every su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
without further ad@@ o , I shall give you the f@@ l@@ o@@ or .
thank you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , for your s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h .
I shall now give the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , the President of the Commission .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to welcome the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on .
this is the first time that Sweden has held the presidency of the Council and it has ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed its priorities , the f@@ a@@ m@@ ous 3 E@@ s , which are in line with the man@@ i@@ f@@ e@@ st@@ o of the European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts , because I am able to say with pr@@ i@@ d@@ e that Mr P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on and his par@@ ty b@@ el@@ on@@ g to my own political family , and the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment which the Swedish P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister has made here in favour of the European social mo@@ de@@ l and its ability to ad@@ ap@@ t in this er@@ a of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation is a further s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of pr@@ i@@ d@@ e .
on employment , I would like to te@@ l@@ l h@@ i@@ m that he can c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on our support at the S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it for t@@ al@@ ks on employment , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion and the term upon which he en@@ ded his s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , social cohesion .
on enlargement , I hope that Sweden &apos; s en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m for enlargement will help the European Union to find greater favour with the Swedish people .
on the environment , we support Sweden &apos; s initiative to put su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development into practice .
Madam President , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has re@@ f@@ er@@ red to an issue we consider f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l and that is the i@@ ma@@ ge of Europe held by public opinion in Europe .
the b@@ ar@@ om@@ e@@ ter of European public opinion , pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in recent d@@ a@@ y@@ s in various n@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s , il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ i@@ a we f@@ ac@@ e .
the people of Europe , even the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish , are as@@ king for more European s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to problems , yet at the same time they still have very little con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in European institutions .
this is an issue which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts us in the Commission and Parliament , but also the national governments .
we see e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of this in the ma@@ d co@@ w problem .
the Commission , by which I mean the S@@ an@@ ter Commission , f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed its role , as did the P@@ ro@@ d@@ i Commission .
Parliament set up a committee of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 and , this w@@ e@@ e@@ k@@ en@@ d , we have seen once again , in the case of A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a and I@@ t@@ al@@ y , how governments finally rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the problem when they have no other op@@ tion .
they are still b@@ ur@@ ying their he@@ ad@@ s in the s@@ and , when what we need are European s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to European problems .
the next issue which is going to k@@ e@@ e@@ p the Swedish Presidency b@@ u@@ s@@ y , and indeed which is going to k@@ e@@ e@@ p us all b@@ u@@ s@@ y , from the year 2001 , which is just be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing , until the year 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 - a f@@ our @-@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ d in which many el@@ ec@@ tions are to take place , including European el@@ ec@@ tions , is the &apos; p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ Nice &apos; sc@@ en@@ ar@@ i@@ o .
I would like to ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the Swedish Presidency .
you are ad@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ d@@ ly no past ma@@ st@@ ers at n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al la@@ b@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ t@@ h of the Community .
you do , however , have rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in the areas of democracy and transparency , and that is what we need at this moment in time .
you therefore have a special responsibility .
indeed , I welcome the commitment you ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed to ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ing at a clear agreement on such a s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve issue as access to d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , but we have to go further than that .
you w@@ ent through the fi@@ ve d@@ a@@ y@@ s of the European Council in Nice , and you will have been as ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed by it as your c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es .
I agree with President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i that it is not the M@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ t m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d which is in question here , but the in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d because , and I would like to point this out to h@@ i@@ m , and this is an on@@ going s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al , our a@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or@@ s are still in the process of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ding n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations .
you said that the Treaty would be si@@ g@@ n@@ ed within a m@@ on@@ th .
we shall have to w@@ a@@ it and see what ch@@ an@@ g@@ es are in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed into the Treaty .
this is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
we must see an end to this m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
therefore , a@@ part from what you said at the end , there is a positive el@@ ement in A@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ x I@@ V in that it does not re@@ f@@ er to another In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence . you m@@ en@@ tion a C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of Member States .
mo@@ re@@ over , you have said s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally that Parliament has a uni@@ qu@@ e role in taking the initiative , and as we are being in@@ no@@ va@@ tive here , I am going to accept President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i &apos; s proposal , a Commission initiative which I welcome .
we have f@@ our years to get to work .
he proposed a three @-@ p@@ ha@@ se op@@ er@@ ation , with the first p@@ ha@@ se con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing of open d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ations .
I would ur@@ ge the Council to become involved in this first p@@ ha@@ se , which you have to be@@ g@@ in and end at L@@ a@@ e@@ k@@ en , during which we have to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d we can use to make progress , and consider not just the future of the Union but the future of the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union because , p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ Nice , those countries are already on si@@ d@@ e and they must le@@ ar@@ n how we op@@ er@@ ate , which is no mean fe@@ at .
therefore , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would also ask you to put forward initiatives for the L@@ a@@ e@@ k@@ en S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it at the end of the year .
secondly , what m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d should we adopt ?
for me and my group the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d should be the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in all our countries : open debate in Parliament , rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed in full .
these d@@ a@@ y@@ s it is available on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
that is a way of ad@@ ap@@ ting and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d , nothing more .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , th@@ e@@ re@@ after , the debate should be re@@ d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted through all for@@ m@@ s of the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a , but civil society should not be pla@@ c@@ ed in op@@ position to P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ ments , because we li@@ ve in re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es and we have to work out a com@@ p@@ le@@ x system .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , Madam President , and this is my fin@@ al point , I believe that the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of Member States must be the last ac@@ t , when decisions on p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al matters are made , and it should not be a ti@@ res@@ om@@ e and en@@ d@@ less process .
that b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me , Madam President , to what really is my fin@@ al point , to say that you could have ad@@ ded another E to the European process , and I say this as a S@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ar@@ d , and that would be the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish wor@@ d for &apos; hope &apos; - e@@ s@@ per@@ an@@ z@@ a .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
Madam President , Commission , I would like to welcome the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister here .
the next si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s will be an ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing per@@ i@@ o@@ d .
important political ta@@ s@@ ks a@@ w@@ a@@ it us , and a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful presidency may h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly also have a positive effect on public opinion .
it can s@@ how our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ m@@ en at h@@ om@@ e that good things can be ac@@ com@@ p@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed together in the EU .
it can s@@ how our European c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es here that Sweden is not in op@@ position to the European pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t but , rather , w@@ is@@ h@@ es to take a con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive part in it .
the Group of the European L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party fully su@@ p@@ por@@ ts Sweden &apos; s decision to make enlargement a priority .
there is no ta@@ s@@ k more important than c@@ re@@ ating a un@@ ited Europe , and the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations really need to take a major le@@ a@@ p forward this s@@ pr@@ ing .
we would also like to have a d@@ ate for when the first countries will be able to j@@ o@@ in us .
another issue - in which the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister has the support of both the L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ als and of large se@@ c@@ tions of Parliament - concerns op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s .
public access to d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments is an important d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c issue , which is c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l to citizens &apos; con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e EU pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t .
during the a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n , the Council has been t@@ re@@ ad@@ ing w@@ a@@ ter on this issue - the work on A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 5@@ 5 - and it is time that we sa@@ w some results .
we have great h@@ op@@ es of Sweden and of Sweden &apos; s role in pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing and p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ fully de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the mo@@ de@@ l ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed , for in@@ st@@ ance , in Sweden and the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds .
as a case in point , why not be@@ g@@ in by op@@ en@@ ing up the m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s of the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters ?
the issue of democracy is also c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y re@@ la@@ ted to the e@@ v@@ ents which are now to take place p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ Nice .
the t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es must be si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fied .
the EU &apos; s ta@@ s@@ ks and p@@ o@@ w@@ ers must be more clearly defin@@ ed .
we L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ als also believe that E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans need a common European con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion .
citizens must be involved in the work which will follow on from the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the Nice su@@ m@@ m@@ it .
it is up to Sweden to in@@ it@@ i@@ ate the p@@ ha@@ se which President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i c@@ al@@ l@@ s &apos; open re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion &apos; .
it would be n@@ ice to be t@@ ol@@ d in rather more con@@ c@@ re@@ te terms how the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister v@@ i@@ e@@ ws this ta@@ s@@ k , the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d and these issues , which re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e further work before the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an Presidency be@@ g@@ in@@ s .
Madam President , President of the Commission , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I have ch@@ o@@ s@@ en to speak Swedish today , since it is my country &apos; s second n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve l@@ an@@ gu@@ age .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I really believe that the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions at the start of the Swedish Presidency are very high following our ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences with the French Presidency .
per@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that Sweden will once more con@@ f@@ ir@@ m the r@@ u@@ le that the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ er Member States are often more im@@ par@@ ti@@ al , something which will favour the common European interest over n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ er national interests .
this is your first presidency , and your A@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or - if I may say this in public - has very n@@ ic@@ el@@ y com@@ pa@@ red a first presidency with l@@ o@@ s@@ ing one &apos; s v@@ i@@ r@@ g@@ in@@ ity .
he certainly did not wish to l@@ o@@ s@@ e it in a v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
I can as@@ sure you that the European Parliament can make a presidency e@@ a@@ si@@ er and that you will therefore l@@ o@@ s@@ e your v@@ i@@ r@@ g@@ in@@ ity in a very g@@ ent@@ le and a@@ m@@ ic@@ able way .
my Group w@@ an@@ ts to see progress particularly in the following areas .
su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development must become a re@@ al@@ ity now .
it is now or n@@ e@@ v@@ er .
the objectives and in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s must be con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with what you have t@@ ol@@ d us .
civil crisis management is something which can be pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted under a Swedish Presidency .
conflict pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion in all areas of f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy is very important to our Group .
we welcome your pr@@ om@@ ise of a programme in this area .
something which perhaps does not have as clear an em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the Swedish agenda is a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve reform of the EU &apos; s agricultural policy , based on the fact that our food must be made sa@@ f@@ e again .
the environment must no longer be d@@ a@@ ma@@ ged and an@@ im@@ als must no longer be m@@ is@@ t@@ re@@ ated .
I have been following the Swedish debate and le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed that you su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly dis@@ co@@ v@@ e@@ red that you are really a v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ ri@@ an , or at least a part @-@ time v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ ri@@ an .
may I welcome you to the c@@ l@@ u@@ b .
it may come as a sur@@ pr@@ ise to y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f and to the citizens of Sweden , but this is one of a number of areas which re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e more , not less , of a European in@@ put .
environmental ta@@ x@@ es are an ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous example .
e@@ ver@@ y@@ b@@ od@@ y ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ tes that the in@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ence on un@@ an@@ im@@ ity needs to be ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed in this area .
as my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es have also p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , what we need here is a Community m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d , that is to say st@@ r@@ on@@ g common institutions - n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y the Commission and Parliament - in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of a m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l cooperation .
to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l cooperation con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s of m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s be@@ h@@ in@@ d c@@ l@@ o@@ sed d@@ o@@ or@@ s which are ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y control .
this will not le@@ a@@ d to the op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s you are st@@ ri@@ v@@ ing for .
I should like to call this a &apos; Swedish par@@ ad@@ o@@ x &apos; .
you must re@@ al@@ ise that , in order to have op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s , the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l cooperation needs to be ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
in the w@@ a@@ k@@ e of the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , it is important that we in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve reform of the EU in which the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments and the European Parliament take an ac@@ tive part .
I hope you take up the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge set out by the President of the Commission .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , there are se@@ ver@@ al points in the programme of the Swedish Presidency which we in the United L@@ e@@ f@@ t support .
in our opinion , the priorities - enlargement , the environment and employment - are important as well as j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
there are also other positive fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of the programme which d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve to be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted .
these in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de measures to com@@ b@@ at tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women and the efforts to at@@ ta@@ in la@@ st@@ ing peace in P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ ine .
where the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons on enlargement are concerned , we consider it to be of v@@ it@@ al importance that the EU take into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation the specific needs of the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries and that these countries not be o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red a second @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s EU m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
in relation to this objective , the ou@@ t@@ come of the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it is a f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e .
no re@@ for@@ m@@ s to the EU were actually made there which would f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate enlargement .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , the decision process b@@ ec@@ a@@ me more com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated .
it is also to@@ t@@ ally un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble that ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries such as the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h R@@ e@@ public and H@@ un@@ g@@ ary should have been di@@ rec@@ tly dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ated against in that they will rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve fe@@ w@@ er pla@@ c@@ es in the European Parliament than EU countries with com@@ par@@ able p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions .
this is an em@@ b@@ ar@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ ing mis@@ take which must be rec@@ ti@@ fied .
my first question to the Swedish Presidency is therefore the following : are you pre@@ pa@@ red to deal with , and rec@@ ti@@ fy , this mis@@ take in the A@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es which are now about to be n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ated ?
certain EU countries want to ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de citizens of the future EU countries from the Union &apos; s la@@ b@@ our market for a long per@@ i@@ o@@ d .
such dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , it is of v@@ it@@ al importance that all those working in an EU country should be ob@@ li@@ ged to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve that country &apos; s ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents and la@@ ws on the la@@ b@@ our market , so that free movement does not result in d@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing where social pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons are concerned .
real le@@ f@@ t @-@ w@@ ing p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s must give to@@ p priority to employment even in matters of economic policy , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of to the d@@ o@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ c m@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ is@@ m which currently d@@ om@@ in@@ a@@ tes the EU and economic and m@@ on@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y uni@@ on .
such a policy would also re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c control of the European C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l B@@ an@@ k .
ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of their political com@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ion , present @-@ day EU governments have , however , made the ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ tion to E@@ M@@ U their priority , rather than w@@ el@@ f@@ are and the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against un@@ employment .
this policy must be re@@ con@@ si@@ de@@ red .
in various par@@ ts of the European Union , there are g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing d@@ em@@ an@@ ds for the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ous de@@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions and free s@@ p@@ ec@@ u@@ la@@ tion we are w@@ it@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing today to be re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by a situation in which un@@ b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ led c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ m is con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed by political decisions .
one of the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds being made is for ta@@ x@@ ation on c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency t@@ r@@ an@@ sa@@ c@@ tions , a so @-@ called T@@ ob@@ in tax .
se@@ ver@@ al members of the Swedish Government have t@@ al@@ k@@ ed in positive terms about this idea .
now - during this presidency - is your g@@ ol@@ d@@ en opportunity to take initiatives .
my second question to the presidency is therefore the following : what initiatives regarding a &apos; T@@ ob@@ in tax &apos; are you pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing during your presidency ?
during the next si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s , the most important question regarding environmental issues will be the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the K@@ y@@ o@@ to P@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce em@@ is@@ si@@ ons of g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se g@@ a@@ se@@ s .
it is extremely important to re@@ ac@@ h an agreement over this issue , but even more so to re@@ ac@@ h an agreement of su@@ b@@ st@@ ance .
in our opinion , such an agreement must be based upon g@@ en@@ u@@ ine re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tions in em@@ is@@ si@@ ons and not upon r@@ ic@@ h countries &apos; ( which are already responsible for most em@@ is@@ si@@ ons ) being given the right to b@@ u@@ y an op@@ t @-@ out v@@ i@@ a trade in em@@ is@@ sion rights .
Sweden &apos; s action in the se@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ ement regarding g@@ en@@ e@@ ti@@ c@@ ally mo@@ di@@ fied c@@ ro@@ p@@ s , which was rec@@ ently fin@@ al@@ is@@ ed , was dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing .
Sweden ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y op@@ p@@ o@@ sed public re@@ g@@ is@@ ters of G@@ M c@@ ro@@ p@@ s .
we hope that Sweden will m@@ en@@ d its w@@ a@@ y@@ s and re@@ f@@ ra@@ in from working towards re@@ v@@ o@@ king the de f@@ ac@@ to m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m which ex@@ is@@ t@@ s on the issue .
from an environmental point of view , EU legislation in this area is still in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate
unfortunately , it se@@ em@@ s that the Swedish Presidency does not want to do an@@ y@@ th@@ ing to e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally change the EU &apos; s ir@@ responsible re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e policy which , with the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement as its in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment , every day g@@ i@@ v@@ es r@@ ise to new tra@@ g@@ ed@@ ies .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , we have seen how Sweden acc@@ e@@ p@@ ts de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation , most rec@@ ently by in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the responsibility b@@ or@@ n@@ e by trans@@ por@@ ters .
this in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es a kind of p@@ ri@@ va@@ t@@ is@@ ation of the s@@ c@@ re@@ en@@ ing for a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses , where the f@@ ate of many a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers is in practice dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed by a@@ ir@@ por@@ t per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the European Union .
the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment a@@ m@@ on@@ g Sweden &apos; s actions is pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly , however , the m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ ation of the EU .
not only does Sweden give up its policies of non @-@ al@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment and in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence , but it is now also going to work ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y towards im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ ation of the EU .
the EU ar@@ my will even in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de Turkish t@@ ro@@ op@@ s .
t@@ ro@@ op@@ s that one day can com@@ m@@ it ac@@ ts of c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty in their own country or o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ y a n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing country are al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to s@@ er@@ ve in the EU ar@@ my the next day .
as a NATO country , Turkey also d@@ em@@ an@@ ds in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence over EU policy in this area in order to make NATO &apos; s military resources available .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , my third question to G@@ ö@@ r@@ an P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on is the following : can you pr@@ om@@ ise that Turkey will not be given any such in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence ?
I am l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to the res@@ p@@ on@@ ses to my three qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons . these concern the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of no longer dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ating against H@@ un@@ g@@ ary and the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h R@@ e@@ public under the Nice A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , what you are going to do to make the T@@ ob@@ in tax a re@@ al@@ ity , and how you view Turkey &apos; s participation in , and in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence over , the EU &apos; s military for@@ c@@ es .
with these words , the United L@@ e@@ f@@ t would like to wish the Swedish Presidency every su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
Madam President , firstly , I wish the Swedish Presidency every su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s in the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that their su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s will certainly be Europe &apos;s su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s as well .
I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency &apos;s p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion here this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on as one that ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to be extremely con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive and p@@ ra@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ c .
I also welcome the com@@ ments made by the Commission President , Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i .
the Swedish government has made it clear that it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to p@@ ri@@ or@@ it@@ ise what is k@@ no@@ w@@ n as the 3 E@@ s during its presidency of the Union , and this re@@ la@@ tes to ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the key problems of enlargement of the Union , employment matters and pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing environmental issues .
I would certainly welcome the in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fication of the enlargement n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations between the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries and the European Union .
we should rec@@ all that the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations are b@@ ro@@ k@@ en up into n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly 4@@ 0 different c@@ ha@@ p@@ ters of t@@ al@@ ks , co@@ ver@@ ing every a@@ m@@ b@@ it of social and economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity that is carried out by the European Union .
P@@ res@@ ently , many of the more difficult c@@ ha@@ p@@ ters of dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons still re@@ main un@@ op@@ en@@ ed , and these in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de agricultural issues , the free movement of per@@ s@@ ons , the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ation of many EU directives and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions in the field of environmental matters .
this is the cor@@ e of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the European Union .
ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries want the EU le@@ ad@@ ers to give a fi@@ x@@ ed d@@ ate for the next enlargement of the Union .
however , the EU governments are se@@ e@@ king the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of the more difficult c@@ ha@@ p@@ ters of t@@ al@@ ks between the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries and the European Union before such a d@@ ate can be an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed .
however , the fact that EU le@@ ad@@ ers were able to agree a reform of the decision @-@ making procedures within the EU institutions at Nice before C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s is certainly a st@@ e@@ p in the right di@@ rec@@ tion .
ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries can now take s@@ ol@@ ac@@ e from the fact that the EU has re@@ for@@ m@@ ed its internal decision @-@ making procedures so that the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ ic@@ s of the enlargement process can take place in a st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ed and st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental matters st@@ a@@ y at the to@@ p of the agenda during its presidency of the Union .
it is im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that the European Union gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es that the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of new information te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es are in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s all se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s of European industry .
e@@ qu@@ ally , it is important that there is an in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fication of support for employment initiatives in ur@@ b@@ an and rural b@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s .
finally , I hope that the European Union and the United States of A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a can come to an agreement in B@@ on@@ n in M@@ a@@ y of this year so as to guarantee that environmental ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the effects of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing can be re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , President of the Commission , I would like to thank you for att@@ en@@ ding and for your su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h .
if you will allow me , I would like to ask you a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f question on an ur@@ g@@ ent matter .
in a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s &apos; time , the Union is due to make a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment on A@@ f@@ g@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ ta@@ n .
it will have to adopt a common p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ . in recent w@@ e@@ e@@ ks , the S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity Council im@@ p@@ o@@ sed an em@@ b@@ ar@@ go on just the T@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ ans . Mr President , I would like to know if the European Union will also adopt this position .
as to the future of the European Union , we have given ourselves over to a certain a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of p@@ o@@ st@@ ur@@ ing , t@@ r@@ ying to make an impact .
some f@@ o@@ rec@@ a@@ st that we will vote against the Treaty of Nice , a per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te action , I feel .
there has been no res@@ p@@ on@@ se on democracy , no res@@ p@@ on@@ se on the r@@ u@@ le of law ; the pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ed d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the Commission was con@@ su@@ m@@ ma@@ ted in Nice .
many members and , I hope , the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity , will le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly come out against this Treaty .
having said that , we are used to a great deal of f@@ le@@ x@@ ing of m@@ u@@ sc@@ l@@ es in the House and we will have to see what will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en when Parliament en@@ ters the r@@ ing to vote .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , I am not sure if you should be too concerned , since the past has many things to te@@ ac@@ h us .
I am not , of course , Mr President , as@@ king you to make a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment against the Treaty of Nice , I am m@@ e@@ re@@ ly as@@ king for your under@@ st@@ an@@ ding .
at the si@@ g@@ n@@ ing of the Treaty of C@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ e , the Council , of which you were a m@@ em@@ b@@ er , th@@ re@@ w Parliament a b@@ one in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights in order to k@@ e@@ e@@ p it qu@@ i@@ e@@ t .
a little too late , Parliament re@@ al@@ is@@ ed that this was indeed its in@@ t@@ en@@ tion and , this is the important point , that this was what you dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed at Nice in the way you dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed it , in other words , the w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ting of v@@ o@@ tes in the Council and the m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the Commission .
having said that , at Nice , it was no b@@ one that was t@@ o@@ s@@ sed to Parliament , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , but a p@@ o@@ is@@ on@@ ed ch@@ al@@ ice .
su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ing an In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 to Parliament and the Commission is like o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing a p@@ o@@ is@@ on@@ ed ch@@ al@@ ice because there will be no Parliament in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 .
we will be b@@ u@@ s@@ y with the pr@@ e @-@ el@@ ec@@ tion c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n for the pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ar@@ ies in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary and F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 and then with the el@@ ec@@ tion c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n pro@@ per in M@@ ar@@ ch , A@@ p@@ ri@@ l and M@@ a@@ y .
the el@@ ec@@ tions will be held in J@@ un@@ e , then we will have a well @-@ e@@ ar@@ n@@ ed re@@ st in J@@ u@@ ly and A@@ u@@ gu@@ st .
there will be the l@@ o@@ w @-@ level pre@@ par@@ at@@ or@@ y m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s in S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er , the great b@@ u@@ d@@ get issue in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er and finally the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence in December .
Mr President , from now on , if you could s@@ how a little under@@ st@@ an@@ ding and ask your c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in the Council either to bring forward this con@@ f@@ er@@ ence to 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 or to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one it until 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 , you may be able to s@@ al@@ va@@ ge the h@@ on@@ our of Parliament , which very often does not se@@ e@@ m to know the m@@ e@@ an@@ ing of the p@@ h@@ ra@@ se .
Madam President , the Group for a Europe of D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es and D@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ities would like to congratulate Sweden on the Presidency . we think it is a good c@@ u@@ st@@ o@@ m for the presidency to al@@ ter@@ n@@ ate .
we are l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to the G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it and hope that a great many citizens will be there under the al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents .
we call upon the presidency of the Council to r@@ e @-@ open the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on the Treaty of Nice so that this can be s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ ised d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c@@ ally .
at present , the ou@@ t@@ come is more c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m and less par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y democracy .
it is also st@@ ar@@ t@@ ling that the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations en@@ ded with a decision to h@@ ol@@ d all su@@ m@@ m@@ its in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s , with the Swedish P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister &apos; s not k@@ no@@ w@@ ing about this decision when we b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed he was involved in making it .
it is pro@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that C@@ z@@ ec@@ h@@ s and H@@ un@@ g@@ ar@@ i@@ ans can be t@@ re@@ ated as in@@ f@@ er@@ i@@ or@@ s and be given fe@@ w@@ er se@@ at@@ s in Parliament than countries with fe@@ w@@ er in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts .
it is un@@ w@@ ise to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity v@@ o@@ ting for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al countries &apos; C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers . in that way , they of course become the EU &apos; s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es in the Member States in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the Member States &apos; re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es in the EU .
with an EU government for@@ m@@ ed through ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity v@@ o@@ ting , an EU State is on the h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate &apos; s pre@@ f@@ er@@ red v@@ is@@ i@@ on of a Europe of n@@ ations and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es .
we call upon Sweden to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce g@@ en@@ u@@ ine f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility in the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations on enlargement so that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the countries can be involved in the c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ a@@ ti@@ ve work and par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the next el@@ ec@@ tions to the EU Parliament in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 .
the Treaty of Nice has been called an enlargement t@@ re@@ at@@ y , but it is a non @-@ b@@ in@@ ding dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation which s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ies the se@@ at@@ s and w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ting of v@@ o@@ tes in Parliament , while the b@@ in@@ ding enlargement pro@@ to@@ co@@ l of the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am is to dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r .
we call upon the Swedish Presidency to ensure that an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed Treaty of Nice only comes into force when the EU ad@@ m@@ its new countries . o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , we shall in fact end up sa@@ ying y@@ es to a t@@ re@@ at@@ y of enlargement , without ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing any enlargement .
we r@@ u@@ n the r@@ is@@ k of the Treaty of Nice &apos; s b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing m@@ e@@ re@@ ly a t@@ re@@ at@@ y for de@@ e@@ pen@@ ing the Union , with more Union and less democracy , and that is something I am sure would not be to the ta@@ st@@ e of the new Swedish President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
. ( de ) Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I may ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to be w@@ e@@ ar@@ ing my Nice h@@ at today , yet I cannot get a@@ way from the fact that in Nice , as before in A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am , we once again f@@ ou@@ n@@ d that as an in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence is fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
on the other hand , I do not believe the much @-@ p@@ raised C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion is fully de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed yet as a procedure .
it could , however , s@@ er@@ ve as the b@@ l@@ u@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ t for a wor@@ k@@ a@@ ble procedure .
so in regard to the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of p@@ o@@ w@@ ers between the Member States and the Union , a question ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed both by the President of the Council and by the President of the Commission , let me ou@@ t@@ line my idea of an effective procedure .
during a first stage , par@@ al@@ le@@ l to the discussion be@@ gu@@ n under the Swedish Presidency , at the in@@ v@@ it@@ ation of the European Council and in fact as e@@ ar@@ ly as possible there should be a discussion and opinion @-@ for@@ m@@ ing process at the level of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , which would then , just like the European Parliament , have to su@@ b@@ m@@ it a proposal by , say , S@@ pr@@ ing 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 on this d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of p@@ o@@ w@@ ers .
only on that basis should a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion be con@@ v@@ en@@ ed , with the participation of con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al ex@@ per@@ ts , ex@@ per@@ ts in European law , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , of the European Parliament , of the national governments , but also of the governments of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate st@@ a@@ tes and , of course , of the Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and of civil society . they would be ch@@ ar@@ ged with d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting a proposal for a in@@ v@@ ent@@ or@@ y , and to do so by ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d S@@ pr@@ ing 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 .
on the basis of that proposal , the Commission in t@@ u@@ r@@ n would be in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ted by the European Council , in stage 3 , to su@@ b@@ m@@ it a proposal to it on the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of p@@ o@@ w@@ ers which could con@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ va@@ b@@ ly ha@@ p@@ p@@ en by the end of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 .
in stage 4 , I am en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ ing rather more st@@ ag@@ es than the Commission President before the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence is con@@ v@@ en@@ ed , this proposal would have to be su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted for f@@ res@@ h discussion at national level , which would have to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de by m@@ i@@ d @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 .
then , in stage 5 , the In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence would be con@@ v@@ en@@ ed , which should be b@@ ri@@ e@@ f and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
in that way , we will ensure that we have a procedure that e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , which has not been possible so far with the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion , and that an agreed proposal is su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the H@@ e@@ ad@@ s of Government .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the institutions ac@@ ting si@@ d@@ e by si@@ d@@ e , as they have done in the past , they would therefore be ac@@ ting together .
. ( de ) Madam President , in order to re@@ mo@@ ve all d@@ ou@@ b@@ t I would now like to make a c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fication .
on S@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ y , 1@@ 4 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a had its first su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ted case of B@@ S@@ E .
allow me to in@@ for@@ m the House that the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te in T@@ ü@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ en in@@ for@@ m@@ ed us y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day that the results were n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve .
I hope the same will apply to all future su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ted cases in A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers , it is so p@@ le@@ as@@ ant to see Sweden h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency of the EU for the first time .
we M@@ od@@ er@@ a@@ tes have always f@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t for Sweden in Europe , but unfortunately we have to point out that Sweden is only responsible for &apos; h@@ al@@ f a presidency &apos; since it is B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , which will be responsible for the issues re@@ la@@ ting to the e@@ ur@@ o .
on the other hand , we hope that Sweden , as the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency , will be able to achieve the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in the work of enlargement .
the common security and de@@ f@@ ence policy has to be made more con@@ c@@ re@@ te during the Swedish Presidency .
development in this area has been sur@@ pr@@ is@@ in@@ g@@ ly ra@@ p@@ i@@ d , but the a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons must now be given some su@@ b@@ st@@ ance .
relations between the EU and NATO will be of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st importance .
commitment and the ability to s@@ ol@@ ve ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding problems are re@@ qu@@ i@@ red if we are to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d con@@ f@@ u@@ sion and if we are to give the EU a com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y role in NATO &apos; s military power .
I hope , therefore , that the fact that NATO does not even get a m@@ en@@ tion in the Swedish programme is more of a ch@@ ance o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ence than part of a strategy .
in t@@ en years &apos; time , the EU will have the most d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c ec@@ on@@ om@@ y in the world .
Sweden is one of those countries which have made the f@@ ur@@ th@@ est st@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ es in the development of the new ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
we have com@@ p@@ an@@ ies which are world le@@ ad@@ ers in te@@ le@@ com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ations and the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
this is ma@@ in@@ ly due to the s@@ er@@ ies of de@@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions which to@@ o@@ k place under the M@@ od@@ er@@ ate @-@ led government between 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 .
the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts for te@@ le@@ com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ations , ma@@ i@@ l , el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity and ra@@ i@@ l tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic , as well as ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , were li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ed .
at the time , Mr P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on was ma@@ in@@ ly op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to these initiatives , but he se@@ em@@ s to have ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed his v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted about this and I hope that Sweden , en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged by good ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences , will be able to pu@@ s@@ h through this kind of development .
the S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it will provide an excellent opportunity .
may it become a de@@ regulation su@@ m@@ m@@ it for j@@ o@@ b@@ s and pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
the debate sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and free trade has received in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing attention .
the time has come to get ri@@ d of the EU &apos; s fin@@ al pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ is@@ t b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers .
the EU , together with the new ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion in the U@@ S@@ A , can re@@ mo@@ ve c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers for agricultural products and the te@@ x@@ ti@@ le industry .
that , if an@@ y@@ th@@ ing , will s@@ how s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with the p@@ o@@ or of the world .
un@@ like the L@@ e@@ f@@ t Party which su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the Swedish Government , I find it gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that the Swedish Presidency st@@ a@@ tes in its P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me that one of its main priorities is to de@@ vote itself to making the EU force the pa@@ ce of development within the W@@ T@@ O towards t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
this dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation is to@@ t@@ ally in line with Sweden &apos; s tra@@ d@@ ition of free trade and op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s towards the sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding world .
the Minister of C@@ om@@ m@@ er@@ ce in Sweden , Mr P@@ ag@@ ro@@ t@@ s@@ k@@ y , has , however , d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed the T@@ ob@@ in tax ( as it is called ) as a n@@ ice idea , and the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister has ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed his s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of those who , by or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ing ri@@ o@@ t@@ s and dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ an@@ c@@ es , sa@@ bo@@ ta@@ ged the W@@ T@@ O meeting in S@@ e@@ att@@ le .
the T@@ ob@@ in tax is a th@@ re@@ at to the p@@ o@@ or of the world .
a T@@ ob@@ in tax would only s@@ er@@ ve to under@@ min@@ e the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of the market .
I would therefore like to ask the following question : could the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , here before Parliament , give a clear st@@ a@@ te@@ ment as to whether the Swedish Presidency is for or against the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of a T@@ ob@@ in tax ?
Madam President , Members of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to welcome the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister of Sweden , Mr G@@ ö@@ r@@ an P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on to Parliament .
I u@@ su@@ ally look forward to all P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es , but this presidency is something quite special , and my ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions of it r@@ u@@ n particularly high .
in my opinion , the priorities st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ ted by Sweden , the three E@@ s , are s@@ ou@@ n@@ d priorities .
they concern a l@@ im@@ ited number of important areas well in line with the EU agenda .
the most important one is , of course , enlargement .
it is a ta@@ s@@ k of h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance to un@@ ite E@@ a@@ st and W@@ est on our con@@ t@@ in@@ ent after years of C@@ ol@@ d W@@ a@@ r .
I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f cannot i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine being able to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the com@@ p@@ le@@ tion of any greater or more important ta@@ s@@ k in the whole of my political life .
Sweden &apos; s a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons of s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ ing up the process in this area are en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te .
I hope that the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with the first countries can s@@ o@@ on be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion and that a ta@@ r@@ get d@@ ate can s@@ o@@ on be set for the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion of these first countries .
I re@@ al@@ ise that this is going to be difficult .
I also re@@ al@@ ise that it must be based on re@@ al@@ is@@ m and that f@@ al@@ se h@@ op@@ es should not be c@@ re@@ ated .
but , at the same time , it is important for the p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions of the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries not to give up hope , but to see the li@@ g@@ h@@ t at the end of the t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l .
the second priority concerns j@@ o@@ b@@ s .
Sweden has been p@@ res@@ sing on with the issue of employment .
in S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m , the in@@ t@@ en@@ tion is to com@@ b@@ ine employment , social policy , k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge development and economic policy into one in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted policy .
the m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed is the open co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d .
what we in Parliament would like is to have a part to pla@@ y in this m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d - just as we have in the case of legislation - since it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly important .
I would like to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve some in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation to this effect .
the third priority concerns long @-@ term su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development .
this is not only a question of economic and social su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability but also of environmental su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability .
the EU is , after all , f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful where environmental policy is concerned .
this is par@@ tly due to the fact that those with the least a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons are un@@ able to b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k decisions , but it is also due to the fact that Parliament has the right of c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on on environmental issues .
what is mis@@ sing in the strategy is a l@@ in@@ k between environmental policy and the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly mentioned areas .
such a l@@ in@@ k must be made before the meeting in S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m and must be one result of the meeting in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
it was important , especially for the enlargement process , that there was agreement in Nice .
all was not en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly well , however - for example , when it c@@ a@@ me to the com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated rules concerning c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on making .
the way in which decisions were made be@@ h@@ in@@ d c@@ l@@ o@@ sed d@@ o@@ or@@ s was not good , either .
Sweden has op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s on its agenda and will pu@@ s@@ h the issue of making d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments available to the public .
I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that Sweden will also ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y pu@@ r@@ su@@ e the g@@ o@@ al of a more open decision @-@ making process .
I s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly hope that Sweden can make a contribution to this issue .
I would also like to say a few words about crisis management .
ac@@ tive crisis management and military non @-@ al@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment is not the same th@@ ing as pa@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ ity , n@@ or has it ever involved pa@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ ity .
ac@@ tive crisis management is about t@@ r@@ ying to pre@@ v@@ ent con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts .
Sweden and F@@ in@@ land have been the tra@@ il@@ b@@ la@@ z@@ ers in ap@@ pl@@ ying c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ an m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s to crisis management and in res@@ or@@ ting to military action only as a last res@@ or@@ t . this is good and will be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in the future .
there is a large ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity in favour of this .
once again , I wish to welcome Sweden as the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency .
Madam President , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister , I too would like to welcome the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister here .
it is not quite the same as at h@@ om@@ e in the Swedish Parliament , but you get used to it f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
many issues re@@ v@@ ol@@ ve ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the three E@@ s .
allow me to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t a f@@ ou@@ r@@ th one , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y E for E@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y .
we were all de@@ e@@ p@@ ly s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed after the C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ ra@@ tions by the i@@ ma@@ ge of people st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling for their li@@ v@@ es o@@ f@@ f the co@@ a@@ st of Turkey in their at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to get to Europe .
many people di@@ ed in their fi@@ g@@ h@@ t for a better life .
I know that you , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister , ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed your dis@@ may after the a@@ w@@ ful tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y last year when 5@@ 8 C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e people were f@@ ou@@ n@@ d de@@ a@@ d in a con@@ ta@@ in@@ er in D@@ over .
Europe must not be trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed into some kind of for@@ t@@ res@@ s .
the European a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e policy must be ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised by di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and h@@ u@@ man@@ ity - that was your m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge at the time .
but what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed since ?
well , the development in Europe has taken a w@@ r@@ on@@ g t@@ u@@ r@@ n .
it has been proposed that the pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es for tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s be made more se@@ ver@@ e .
this is necessary , but the proposals are un@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ used in their effect .
non @-@ prof@@ it @-@ making organisations - ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es , re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous or@@ d@@ ers , a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m organisations and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks which support a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers - are th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed with pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es .
these proposals must be st@@ op@@ p@@ ed .
in Sweden , protection against the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of the s@@ an@@ c@@ t@@ ity of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ es has pre@@ va@@ il@@ ed since the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le A@@ g@@ es .
European le@@ ad@@ ers should re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t on why tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s to Europe is d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing .
Europe is being c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a visa re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment on 1@@ 3@@ 0 countries is not wor@@ th@@ y of a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c Europe .
the b@@ a@@ si@@ c r@@ u@@ le must be that people have the right to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l f@@ re@@ el@@ y to the EU .
is the Swedish Presidency pre@@ pa@@ red to work towards making the l@@ is@@ t of countries from which v@@ is@@ as are re@@ qu@@ i@@ red con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly sh@@ or@@ ter ?
I am an ar@@ d@@ ent su@@ p@@ por@@ ter of the EU and have for a long time now w@@ an@@ ted to see common rules within the a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e policy , but we L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ als are not pre@@ pa@@ red to accept any kind of &apos; c@@ or@@ d@@ on@@ ed @-@ o@@ f@@ f &apos; Europe .
this , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister , is an opportunity for the new presidency to make an important contribution towards h@@ u@@ man@@ ity and human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity in the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of R@@ a@@ ou@@ l W@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ b@@ er@@ g , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e m@@ em@@ or@@ y you have so com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ab@@ ly h@@ on@@ ou@@ red .
E@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y is the key wor@@ d .
Mr President , as re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of the people and the regions , we regard Sweden as an ally in our de@@ f@@ ence of things that are de@@ a@@ r to us , such as l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ti@@ c and cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , but if you are going to t@@ al@@ k about in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments more we would want the same a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of attention to be de@@ voted to the institutions of our con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al regions , and of our governments .
we would like our regions to be able to en@@ g@@ age in di@@ rec@@ t dialogue , so as to re@@ mo@@ ve the dis@@ par@@ ity in employment levels that can ex@@ is@@ t between different regions and one Member State .
we welcome Sweden as an en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly presidency , but Sweden would be ac@@ ting com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly out of ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter if it were to s@@ en@@ d M@@ O@@ X f@@ u@@ e@@ l to S@@ el@@ la@@ field .
this would be in di@@ rec@@ t con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tion with the si@@ g@@ n@@ ing of O@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R , under the terms of which all parties are called upon to de@@ f@@ end the non @-@ pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing op@@ tion .
finally , enlargement .
not only is it f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l to the enlargement to see the ac@@ qu@@ is com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ta@@ ir@@ e adopted in the ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al s@@ en@@ se p@@ ri@@ or , more than an@@ y@@ th@@ ing we want attention to be given to the e@@ th@@ ical d@@ im@@ en@@ sion .
I am t@@ al@@ king democracy , respect for human rights and min@@ or@@ ities , so that Europe is able to become a real com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity of v@@ al@@ u@@ es , in sh@@ or@@ t , a Community with a c@@ ap@@ it@@ al &apos; C &apos; .
Mr President , the programme of the Swedish Presidency is a fin@@ e p@@ i@@ ec@@ e of work , but there is still no in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation as to how it is to be ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted at a p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al level .
how does the presidency pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e to implement this a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous programme ?
as well as the Swedish priorities , there are all the matters le@@ f@@ t un@@ res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed by the French still to be de@@ al@@ t with .
this is the first time that Sweden has held the presidency of the European Union and it has ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly made enlargement an important priority .
but is it not taking a rather over @-@ op@@ ti@@ mis@@ ti@@ c view of how much w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness there is within the European Union to ad@@ m@@ it the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate st@@ a@@ tes ?
the decision not to qu@@ o@@ t@@ e st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s in relation to acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ ks of a he@@ al@@ th@@ y s@@ en@@ se of re@@ al@@ is@@ m , given that this is de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed by the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
it is important for the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate st@@ a@@ tes to be o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red a b@@ ri@@ g@@ h@@ ter future , in freedom , n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ it@@ ating an increase in employment levels and the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development through en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally @-@ f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
the g@@ o@@ al of c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ing as many n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating c@@ ha@@ p@@ ters as possible with the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate st@@ a@@ tes over the next si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s , is a wor@@ th@@ while one .
however , we would do well to consider that the internal market must be able to continue to f@@ un@@ c@@ tion e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently in the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union .
when it comes to the enlargement n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , how does the presidency pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e to deal with the directives that have not been cor@@ rec@@ tly im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted in the current Member States for some time ?
on a fin@@ al no@@ te , the proposal to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te environmental aspects into other policy areas , such as ta@@ x@@ ation of energy , is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed with open ar@@ m@@ s .
this in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion is an excellent point of de@@ par@@ ture for the si@@ x@@ th environmental action programme , as are the con@@ c@@ re@@ te g@@ o@@ als and in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s that are to be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in this programme .
however , it is still un@@ clear to me as to how this is to be com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with the proposed li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the W@@ T@@ O .
Mr President , Sweden has every right to be pr@@ ou@@ d of its policy of making e@@ qu@@ al rights for men and women a re@@ al@@ ity .
you can i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that I was rather sur@@ pr@@ ised to see just how m@@ al@@ e @-@ d@@ om@@ in@@ ated your own re@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ e is .
a key as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of your line of ar@@ gu@@ ment is that the people of the European Union should be our first priority .
now I come from a country that se@@ ts great st@@ or@@ e by the ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion : &apos; not words but de@@ ed@@ s &apos; and you will s@@ o@@ on have this opportunity .
for example there is a regulation on the ta@@ ble which re@@ gu@@ la@@ tes access to d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments from the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
there are fi@@ ve qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons I would like to ask you .
firstly , what do you pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e to do with the he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ised Commission proposal in this s@@ p@@ here ?
my second question is this : are you going to ra@@ d@@ ic@@ ally ad@@ ap@@ t the current French Council proposal with a view to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing greater transparency ?
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , are you pre@@ pa@@ red to get o@@ f@@ f to a f@@ l@@ ying start in b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing the Council working groups together , so as to be able to re@@ ac@@ h an under@@ st@@ an@@ ding with Parliament as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible ?
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly , will you gra@@ s@@ p the n@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ le of ra@@ d@@ ical change and make the Council d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments available on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t now , th@@ e@@ re@@ by pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing transparency into practice ?
my fi@@ f@@ th question is : do you consider that European citizens are less ent@@ it@@ led to op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s with regard to the B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion than A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an citizens are as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds their W@@ a@@ sh@@ in@@ g@@ t@@ on ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion ?
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , a fin@@ al question : do you have the c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge to in@@ it@@ i@@ ate your own process of op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s in relation to the p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ Nice er@@ a , of p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y the kind put forward by the President of the Commission ?
what would your an@@ s@@ w@@ er be to that ?
I think , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , that it is extremely important for us not just to he@@ a@@ r fin@@ e words , but above all , what will your de@@ ed@@ s be ?
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I wish Sweden good l@@ u@@ c@@ k in its first presidency .
the three E@@ s are three good priorities that we share .
I would like to t@@ al@@ k b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly about enlargement .
we support this as much as you do . it must be su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
we must n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ get that su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s is l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on our ability to man@@ age our internal a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s pro@@ per@@ ly as well .
the le@@ g@@ ac@@ y of Nice is not a good le@@ g@@ ac@@ y .
you will have to deal with it .
however , to mo@@ ve on to your second priority , employment , which re@@ la@@ tes to my te@@ m@@ por@@ ary position in Parliament .
in the course of its development , the Union had fi@@ ve years to pre@@ par@@ e for the external market , but with b@@ in@@ ding le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments .
it was the same for the e@@ ur@@ o .
we are currently taking on the new ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing employment and even ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing a re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to full employment , as some d@@ a@@ re@@ d to say at the Nice S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , with our ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l and we have all seen what could be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed without b@@ in@@ ding le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments .
this means , however , that we should re@@ in@@ for@@ ce con@@ ver@@ g@@ ence and in@@ c@@ en@@ tive in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments .
this pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y means better co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic , especially , in our case , ma@@ c@@ ro@@ financial policy , and employment policy in the European Union .
Mr President , you will be c@@ ha@@ ir@@ ing the new European Council in the s@@ pr@@ ing , which will be the first Council to deal with general ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic objectives al@@ on@@ g with employment objectives .
you will set a p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ent by for@@ c@@ ing discussion and by for@@ c@@ ing governments to com@@ par@@ e results , rather than m@@ e@@ re@@ ly in@@ t@@ en@@ tions .
we also need co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of all the various aspects of European policy in order to promote employment .
our com@@ p@@ et@@ ition policy is one of the best @-@ defin@@ ed policies and one that wor@@ ks the best . should its only g@@ o@@ al be to achieve he@@ al@@ th@@ y economic com@@ p@@ et@@ ition ?
m@@ er@@ g@@ ers and re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing are f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ences .
what is their ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e in terms of employment and g@@ ro@@ w@@ th ?
the Commission ap@@ p@@ li@@ es the current c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
the Council would pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly be well ad@@ v@@ is@@ ed to ad@@ just the b@@ al@@ ance of these c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
com@@ p@@ et@@ ition should also work in favour of employment .
we have the same need for internal policy co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation in the Union re@@ for@@ m@@ s of public pro@@ c@@ u@@ re@@ ment con@@ tra@@ c@@ t procedures or in the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions for services of general interest .
I did have more qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons but I am out of time .
Mr President , Parliament is a place where we do not actually debate very much .
you will get used to it and you will find it does not sa@@ d@@ d@@ en you too much .
it certainly sa@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ s me .
Mr President , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I should like to congratulate P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on on an a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous and results @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ted programme .
I hope it means that the EU will take se@@ ver@@ al st@@ e@@ p@@ s forward and that it will also re@@ in@@ for@@ ce the i@@ ma@@ ge of the EU in Sweden .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g the issues c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st to people &apos; s he@@ ar@@ ts , one of the most important no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ y@@ s is that of food safety .
I have no@@ ted that the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister has ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed his h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ an@@ c@@ y about e@@ ating m@@ e@@ at in view of the w@@ a@@ y@@ s in which an@@ im@@ als and m@@ e@@ at products are t@@ re@@ ated .
despite the fact that I am an ol@@ d f@@ ar@@ m@@ er and an in@@ v@@ e@@ te@@ ra@@ te m@@ e@@ at @-@ e@@ a@@ ter , I can no@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ y@@ s understand people who feel like that .
Parliament will be ad@@ op@@ ting p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons on some e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ty food safety directives .
we are now be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the proposal for a European food a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
I would be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed to he@@ a@@ r what the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister &apos; s att@@ it@@ u@@ de is to such an a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
in a common market , common rules and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions as well as common con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s , and - if the rules are not f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed - a common system of s@@ an@@ c@@ tions are re@@ qu@@ i@@ red .
such an over@@ all s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion re@@ qu@@ i@@ res more than the proposed food a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
my opinion is that it has to f@@ un@@ c@@ tion in cooperation with the EU &apos; s F@@ o@@ o@@ d and V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ary Office in D@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ in and with the Commission .
within the s@@ p@@ here of in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence of such a t@@ ri@@ an@@ g@@ le , ad@@ v@@ ice and con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion , r@@ is@@ k as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment , r@@ is@@ k management and s@@ an@@ c@@ tions could be de@@ al@@ t with within the framework of ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s and could provide an i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ c@@ al level of food safety throughout the Union .
I hope to have the support of the presidency for this idea .
Mr President , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the Council and the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that the Swedish Presidency has acc@@ or@@ d@@ ed the environment a high priority . this is v@@ it@@ ally necessary , and it also en@@ ta@@ il@@ s responsibility .
to re@@ ver@@ se the de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation in the li@@ v@@ ing environment re@@ qu@@ i@@ res ra@@ d@@ ical political decisions - a b@@ re@@ a@@ k in the t@@ r@@ end .
ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions are high in view of the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment of Mr P@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , to the effect that su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development on the EU &apos; s agenda will le@@ a@@ d to a g@@ re@@ en strategy for the 2@@ 1@@ st c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
this in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y with ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d @-@ rules , in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting environmental issues in all other policies and in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the necessary means of control .
it is therefore in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble that the Swedish Government is ac@@ ting in op@@ position to such environment @-@ re@@ la@@ ted ta@@ x@@ es at EU level as min@@ im@@ u@@ m levels of c@@ ar@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e and energy ta@@ x@@ es .
why was a n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve decision made on this in Nice ?
another question of great im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate interest is how the Swedish Presidency is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing to as@@ su@@ me the ta@@ s@@ k - which it has in@@ h@@ er@@ ited from Nice - of for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ting a strategy for the political future of the EU .
you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council - al@@ on@@ g with a large pro@@ por@@ tion of the population of the Member States - are , of course , op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to a f@@ ed@@ er@@ al development of the EU .
what is your v@@ is@@ i@@ on and how do you en@@ v@@ is@@ age su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity and the di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in the future ?
how is the President pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in a Swedish policy of non @-@ al@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment and n@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ ity while , at the same time , his ta@@ s@@ k during the presidency is to continue to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p the EU &apos; s military c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity ?
finally , I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency .
Mr President , I would firstly like to wish the Swedish Presidency of the European Union l@@ u@@ c@@ k .
as the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council k@@ no@@ ws , the work of a presidency does not con@@ s@@ is@@ t s@@ ol@@ el@@ y of de@@ f@@ en@@ ding its national interests , but also of se@@ e@@ king con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s so that European in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion may mo@@ ve forward .
and the only way to mo@@ ve forward is to establish h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ i@@ ous cooperation between the three institutions : the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
we are therefore re@@ as@@ su@@ red to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the o@@ f@@ f@@ er of cooperation you made Parliament today , especially in view of the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments to which Mr P@@ o@@ et@@ ter@@ ing re@@ f@@ er@@ red just now , in which , ap@@ par@@ ently , you dec@@ la@@ red that the Commission is an in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from a serious d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ f@@ ic@@ it and that , following the 1999 el@@ ec@@ tions and the l@@ o@@ w t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ out of citizens in your country , the European Parliament should be dis@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed .
I do not know whether these reports are t@@ r@@ u@@ e or not , or whether they have been d@@ en@@ i@@ ed or not , but I believe , Mr President , that these st@@ a@@ te@@ ments re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e some ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation .
having said that , when dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the Europe of v@@ al@@ u@@ es , you re@@ f@@ er@@ red to the need to ex@@ por@@ t the system of the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights to third countries .
I do not know ex@@ ac@@ tly what you m@@ e@@ ant by that .
if we are to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t third countries to ad@@ here to certain v@@ al@@ u@@ es , to which we have not ourselves been c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of ad@@ h@@ er@@ ing , then perhaps the most l@@ o@@ g@@ ical in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion is that you have now become a f@@ er@@ v@@ ent su@@ p@@ por@@ ter of making the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights b@@ in@@ ding in nature and perhaps even including it in the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es .
in op@@ en@@ ing your s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , you re@@ f@@ er@@ red to the European Union pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , which you defin@@ ed as an as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation of w@@ el@@ f@@ are st@@ a@@ tes .
the w@@ el@@ f@@ are in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of a Europe with em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble , on c@@ as@@ h , the n@@ e@@ t b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ary and the n@@ e@@ t b@@ al@@ ance , is a le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te but in@@ com@@ p@@ le@@ te v@@ is@@ i@@ on of Europe .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the Europe of w@@ el@@ f@@ are must be su@@ b@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate to a Europe of v@@ al@@ u@@ es , since the e@@ s@@ s@@ ence of the European Union is an on@@ going ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for peace , under@@ st@@ an@@ ding , h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity , and we would ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate your con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to be@@ a@@ r this in mind .
Mr President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is , of course , not possible for me to com@@ ment on all the v@@ i@@ e@@ ws , but I can dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s some of the main fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of se@@ ver@@ al of the s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , I will not go into qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons re@@ la@@ ting to Swedish d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic policy , since we can deal with such matters in other con@@ te@@ x@@ ts . in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , I will con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on the major European issues .
I s@@ en@@ se a st@@ r@@ on@@ g de@@ si@@ r@@ e on the part of se@@ ver@@ al of the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es - not least on the part of the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the large political groups - to work together with the presidency towards greater transparency .
this is an issue on which , as you all know , there are different ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es within the Union , which is why we are going to have a difficult and com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated ta@@ s@@ k on our h@@ an@@ ds over the next few m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , we think that one of the essential pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ es for b@@ u@@ il@@ ding con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the European Union , in its policies and its institutions is that there be transparency ; that it be possible to follow the way in which an issue is de@@ al@@ t with ; that ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ bility can be d@@ em@@ an@@ ded ; and that debate can be en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in .
in that way , a European political s@@ pa@@ ce can be c@@ re@@ ated for con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ting a debate , which in t@@ u@@ r@@ n is the pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for b@@ u@@ il@@ ding institutions which will go on to c@@ re@@ ate in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ c@@ y .
what has been said by Mr P@@ o@@ et@@ ter@@ ing , Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o and others on this subject is , of course , excellent and something to which I su@@ b@@ sc@@ ri@@ be .
many have re@@ f@@ er@@ red to enlargement , especially Mr B@@ ar@@ ó@@ n C@@ res@@ p@@ o in his p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful v@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ ary s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h .
I have also been as@@ k@@ ed by Mrs M@@ al@@ m@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m whether we can s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy a d@@ ate for when the first ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant country will g@@ a@@ in acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion to the Union .
this is something which I - which we - wish to see , but we are not going to give that in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation .
we will not con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t that debate until we know that the su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ tive n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations which will have to be held are also to be su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
I think we would be g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the w@@ r@@ on@@ g si@@ g@@ n@@ al if we were to in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate a certain point in time when the first of the countries currently n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p were to j@@ o@@ in the Union .
it would be the w@@ r@@ on@@ g si@@ g@@ n@@ al because we would first like to see the difficult n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations with which we are f@@ ac@@ ed result in a b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ through .
such a b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ through can take place during the Swedish Presidency and we may then very well be able to s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy a d@@ ate in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
I hope that this will be the case .
I would like it to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en , but I am not sure if it will .
when we t@@ al@@ k about the major issues and enlargement , it se@@ em@@ s that we are more or less in agreement .
there is no f@@ ir@@ m@@ er support for enlargement than that o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by the European Parliament .
this is more a pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t of the European Parliament than of any other in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion .
it is Parliament that has been responsible for enlargement .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , I am extremely an@@ x@@ i@@ ous that it should also be possible for the Treaty we si@@ g@@ n@@ ed in Nice to be ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed , because that in t@@ u@@ r@@ n is the pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for its being possible to implement enlargement .
I hope we can res@@ ol@@ ve the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences on f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ al matters which ex@@ is@@ t between the Commission , the Council and Parliament so that we can make some progress on the issue of enlargement .
enlargement is our common responsibility , an h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic opportunity to put an end to the di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of Europe into E@@ a@@ st and W@@ est .
I agree with what Mr A@@ n@@ d@@ er@@ s@@ s@@ on said in his s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , to the effect that the Treaty of Nice - despite its f@@ la@@ ws and sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s - n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s op@@ en@@ ed the d@@ o@@ or to enlargement , something which it is important to m@@ en@@ tion .
in their s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es , se@@ ver@@ al Members have also t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about the environmental issue .
I at@@ ta@@ ch great v@@ al@@ u@@ e to the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments of Mrs H@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ al@@ a and others .
in my opinion , the environmental issue should not be seen as a b@@ ra@@ k@@ e on economic development but , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , as a d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force .
all the major environmental problems we see at present will be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed by new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
this is something of which I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed .
I am also con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that we , in practice , already have the te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y . it is available .
we know what , in all l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ d , needs to be done .
when our citizens see what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing , for example on the c@@ li@@ ma@@ te issue , and that we cannot get together and pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce some kind of j@@ o@@ in@@ t res@@ p@@ on@@ se , that is n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally something which will under@@ min@@ e con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in our institutions .
I therefore believe that the G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it will be an important point of de@@ par@@ ture , en@@ ab@@ ling us to s@@ how that there is a p@@ at@@ h to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , development and f@@ a@@ it@@ h in human ability are in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted through political in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment .
if we place the em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on this , we shall also be at the c@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing ed@@ ge of the te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical development which is a pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve Europe .
look at environmental concern as a d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force and not as a b@@ ra@@ k@@ e and as no@@ st@@ al@@ g@@ i@@ a for a time which has pa@@ s@@ sed .
look at environmental concern as a v@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ ary contribution to a better and more m@@ od@@ er@@ n Europe .
we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be able to adopt that approach al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e the c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ able work Commissioner W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m is doing with her environmental c@@ are programme for issues re@@ la@@ ting to ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als and the way in which the use of these is re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted .
ad@@ d all this together , and we should be able to ob@@ ta@@ in a pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing ou@@ t@@ come in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
I take no@@ te of what you have said about the environmental issue and I share your v@@ i@@ e@@ ws to a great ex@@ t@@ ent .
employment is , of course , l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y a policy which already is , and for the f@@ o@@ re@@ se@@ e@@ able future will re@@ main , a responsibility of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments .
in the open co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation which is a fe@@ a@@ ture of the L@@ is@@ b@@ on process , we have f@@ ou@@ n@@ d a way of j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing the development of employment in the Union .
I fully share Mr R@@ o@@ c@@ ar@@ d &apos; s view that , if we are to come c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r still to full employment , the ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic discussion is going to become ever more c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l .
to put it more simply : how can we make use of the fact that we are co@@ op@@ er@@ ating within a European uni@@ on in order , for example , to provide more st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ tion for economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th ?
our situation is such that we are not v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able to ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ences .
an is@@ ol@@ ated country is v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able , but not so a uni@@ on of countries .
this is something we should dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s , and - I f@@ re@@ el@@ y ad@@ m@@ it this - it is particularly important in the case of those countries which are already co@@ op@@ er@@ ating over the e@@ ur@@ o .
they have more opportunities of taking ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of their situation or of st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ ting more ro@@ b@@ u@@ st economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and , in that way , in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d employment .
I am quite sure that dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons of this kind will take place in the group of e@@ ur@@ o countries .
after all , the work which for@@ m@@ s the cor@@ e of the European Union has to do with the internal market and that m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of working in terms of com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity legislation that is in the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of M@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ t .
that cor@@ e has , of course , already been b@@ u@@ il@@ t .
what has now been ad@@ ded is cooperation within another field , something which we , for in@@ st@@ ance , call the L@@ is@@ b@@ on process .
there are different ex@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ons .
ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of which form of cooperation we c@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ e , the same re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s and transparency apply .
I do not wish to see a situation in which States and governments h@@ ol@@ d dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons between themselves which could be con@@ si@@ de@@ red as being c@@ l@@ o@@ sed and se@@ c@@ re@@ t and which make public control im@@ possible .
ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of which m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s we apply , op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s is of f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l importance .
many other things have been said which I feel st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly about , but let me just say that there are two con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions which I find to be of a special and ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ al nature , but which are of c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l political importance and which , I want to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e , I have su@@ b@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ed to .
what Mr O@@ l@@ s@@ s@@ on sa@@ y@@ s about food policy , food quality , the interest of con@@ su@@ m@@ ers in their right to protection and the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ al of con@@ su@@ m@@ er con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence is very much in line with my own th@@ in@@ king regarding the presidency &apos; s approach .
Mr O@@ l@@ le S@@ ch@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ t t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about policy on re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and about a g@@ en@@ er@@ ous att@@ it@@ u@@ de on the part of the European Union towards those who t@@ u@@ r@@ n to us in se@@ ar@@ ch of safety and protection .
the G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion must , of course , form the basis of any th@@ in@@ king about this subject , but we should also have a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons over and above this .
as a w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y se@@ c@@ tion of a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , we really should be able to a@@ f@@ for@@ d such a policy .
together , not in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ ally .
these are a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons we could very well have ar@@ gu@@ ments and dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons about , and it is an area in which we could take the Union for@@ w@@ ar@@ ds .
I am very s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c to what Mr O@@ l@@ le S@@ ch@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ t said in his s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h about a h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e policy .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I would like to say that those of us involved in the Swedish Presidency will f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently be in your be@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ful b@@ u@@ il@@ ding to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t t@@ al@@ ks and dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons , but we would also like you , for your part , to get in t@@ ou@@ ch with ourselves .
we will also be ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve you as gu@@ e@@ st@@ s in our s@@ om@@ e@@ what c@@ ol@@ d and d@@ is@@ t@@ ant country , a country which , however , will be full of w@@ ar@@ m@@ th and f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ sh@@ i@@ p on such o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons . of that I can as@@ sure you .
you are all very welcome .
I am l@@ o@@ o@@ king forward to co@@ op@@ er@@ ating with all the political groups in Parliament with a view to de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing the European Union .
. ( de ) Mr President , I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for taking such a positive approach to the S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m su@@ m@@ m@@ it and a@@ im@@ ing at economic su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability , which li@@ es in the interests of full employment , economic reform , in@@ no@@ va@@ tion and the future v@@ i@@ ability of the European Union .
what we need in S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m is not a de@@ regulation su@@ m@@ m@@ it .
we need a su@@ m@@ m@@ it that makes it clear at what European Union level we can re@@ gu@@ late e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing best , so that we really can make progress in using the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market in the interests not just of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y but also of the people , of the workers .
so I would like to make a request to the Swedish Presidency . if you want to s@@ how greater transparency and greater democracy , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in relation to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating economic policy , make a start by in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the European Parliament in the ma@@ c@@ ro@@ economic dialogue , in every initiative and in el@@ ab@@ or@@ ating the b@@ a@@ si@@ c fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of economic policy .
we will first su@@ b@@ m@@ it our proposals in the framework of a le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive procedure .
we will see whether the Swedish Presidency really is taking this issue of over@@ com@@ ing the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ f@@ ic@@ it on bo@@ ar@@ d and is pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing p@@ ra@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally , by small st@@ e@@ p@@ s .
that is a very cor@@ di@@ al request by the European Parliament , which has been c@@ al@@ l@@ ing since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 for an in@@ ter@@ in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al agreement of that kind to be re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed .
I would ask the presidency to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e the L@@ is@@ b@@ on process con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently , en@@ sur@@ ing that all policy areas re@@ f@@ er@@ red to in it k@@ e@@ e@@ p the same st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s .
that means we really do implement an appropriate and a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate policy m@@ i@@ x , by pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing a policy of social in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion , full employment and economic re@@ for@@ m@@ s based on clear ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ l@@ es together with quality b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to financial policy , for we must be@@ g@@ in by making it clear through our in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment policy that the people of Europe can achieve ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e through cooperation at European level , through in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in people , but also in in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
let me ad@@ d@@ res@@ s one last com@@ ment to the Swedish Presidency : we place our h@@ op@@ es in you to ensure that the citizens of Europe , most of w@@ h@@ o@@ m are very wor@@ ri@@ ed , can f@@ ac@@ e the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the e@@ ur@@ o without fe@@ a@@ r .
p@@ le@@ a@@ se work very c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y with the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an Presidency and call on all the pla@@ y@@ ers in the v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es , to@@ w@@ n@@ s and c@@ ap@@ it@@ als to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate . for the e@@ ur@@ o is a b@@ ol@@ d h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t that can only su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed if we all pu@@ l@@ l together .
Mr President , Commissioner , as you he@@ ar@@ d from our Group c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an e@@ ar@@ li@@ er in the debate , the E@@ P@@ P v@@ is@@ ited B@@ er@@ l@@ in last w@@ e@@ e@@ k .
before le@@ a@@ v@@ ing , I and some c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es were able to v@@ is@@ it P@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ am where of course the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence to@@ o@@ k place where President T@@ r@@ u@@ m@@ an , P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister C@@ h@@ ur@@ ch@@ il@@ l - b@@ i@@ z@@ ar@@ re@@ ly re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by Mr A@@ t@@ le@@ y m@@ i@@ d @-@ con@@ f@@ er@@ ence - and M@@ ar@@ s@@ ha@@ l S@@ t@@ al@@ in agreed to con@@ f@@ ir@@ m the Y@@ al@@ t@@ a di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of Europe .
the Swedish Presidency , as we have he@@ ar@@ d during the debate , has raised high h@@ op@@ es that we may achieve over the next si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s the re@@ st@@ or@@ ation of a uni@@ fied Europe , but I believe the time for r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic has pa@@ s@@ sed and what we are all l@@ o@@ o@@ king for now are results .
I w@@ on@@ d@@ er if f@@ our qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons could be trans@@ m@@ it@@ ted to the Swedish Presidency .
first of all , does it in@@ t@@ end to con@@ v@@ en@@ e a c@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l or a special meeting to which the government re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries would be in@@ v@@ ited , not only to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations , but to give the important si@@ g@@ n@@ al to the public that enlargement is not m@@ e@@ re@@ ly a political ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise , a m@@ i@@ ra@@ ge , a con@@ st@@ an@@ tly d@@ is@@ t@@ ant objective , but that we are g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y making the progress which is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red ?
secondly , could the b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations be te@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ red by an under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of the past ?
it does se@@ e@@ m c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ly difficult in a s@@ en@@ se that the way the enlargement process is p@@ res@@ en@@ ted is m@@ e@@ re@@ ly a question of con@@ for@@ m@@ ing to some technical ac@@ qu@@ is , i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ ing , perhaps , the specific di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es that the B@@ al@@ ti@@ c R@@ e@@ pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ s and other C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n European countries f@@ ac@@ ed under the S@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ t system .
with the ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble which we have set ourselves : does the Swedish Presidency agree that this n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ it@@ a@@ tes trans@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al per@@ i@@ od@@ s , and , finally , can we con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that no new h@@ ur@@ d@@ l@@ es will be pla@@ c@@ ed in the p@@ at@@ h of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries .
clearly today it has been Sweden &apos;s day .
we all very much hope that in si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s &apos; time in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g , once again , it will not only be Sweden &apos;s day , but Europe &apos;s day .
Mr President , I w@@ ar@@ m@@ ly welcome the Swedish Presidency , although the situation in which they find themselves as they as@@ su@@ me the presidency may not be a very en@@ v@@ i@@ able one .
we have rec@@ ently had perhaps the most con@@ f@@ u@@ sed S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it the EU has ever seen .
problems are being th@@ ra@@ sh@@ ed out right up to the time the agreement is about to be ra@@ ti@@ fied , and that does not , on any account , give a good p@@ ic@@ ture of su@@ m@@ m@@ its g@@ en@@ er@@ ally or the work of the Council .
for that reason , it is very sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ying to no@@ te that Sweden , as the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency , has in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated its de@@ si@@ r@@ e to help st@@ e@@ er the work of the Council in a s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally more trans@@ par@@ ent di@@ rec@@ tion .
the programme of the Swedish Presidency is full @-@ bo@@ di@@ ed and a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous , and it really is time environmental issues in their b@@ ro@@ ad@@ est context were finally taken to the cor@@ e of any debate in the European Union .
the programme of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted for the EU , which has been agreed will form part of the R@@ i@@ o P@@ l@@ u@@ s process at the G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , must con@@ ta@@ in all those el@@ em@@ ents of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability that have been p@@ ri@@ or@@ it@@ ised for the presidency of the EU .
in my opinion , all three E &apos; s are a guarantee of this su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability .
but I am n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly wor@@ ri@@ ed , and I will now ad@@ d@@ res@@ s my words to the Commission , about the ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble for d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting the su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts for debate , for example , for the G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it .
how will this ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble make it possible for the European Parliament to be fully involved in the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting of the programme re@@ la@@ ting to su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development , for example ?
however , I would like to thank the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency for including the issue of the n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n d@@ im@@ en@@ sion on the agenda .
and I would once more like to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s a question to the Commission , which is how a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate resources - st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ing resources , for example - can be gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed so that this n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n d@@ im@@ en@@ sion policy also rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es the go @-@ a@@ he@@ a@@ d for an ex@@ t@@ en@@ sion from the Commission .
Mr President , I too should like to welcome the Swedish Presidency and its programme which con@@ ta@@ in@@ s many good priorities .
just like a whole su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion of s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers here today , I am wor@@ ri@@ ed about the t@@ en@@ d@@ ency to f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently and st@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ently em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e the in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l mo@@ de@@ l at the ex@@ pen@@ se of the mo@@ de@@ l we com@@ m@@ on@@ ly call the &apos; Community approach &apos; , i@@ .@@ e@@ . one which in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es the Commission &apos; s being given a greater role and importance .
I no@@ te the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister &apos; s as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es of op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s , ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of which mo@@ de@@ l is ch@@ o@@ s@@ en , but the question is , of course , more far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing than that .
the in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing contribution by Commissioner P@@ ro@@ d@@ i con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es we f@@ ac@@ e .
I l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ed with interest to the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister &apos; s com@@ ments on the environmental issues .
they s@@ ou@@ n@@ d fin@@ e , but there is a problem in that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of today &apos; s environmental problems are di@@ rec@@ tly l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to energy con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion , and the problem is that Europe at present has no energy policy .
the Member States have not even man@@ ag@@ ed to agree about a common ch@@ ar@@ ge on c@@ ar@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e .
the Swedish Government has st@@ a@@ ted that it w@@ an@@ ts to see such a ch@@ ar@@ ge , but only if a un@@ an@@ im@@ ous decision on this can be re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed which , however , is the same th@@ ing as no decision at all .
for t@@ en years , this question has been b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed by in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al governments .
what makes the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister and the Government think that it could be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed at this present time ?
without a ch@@ ar@@ ge on c@@ ar@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e , the EU will not be able to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of the K@@ y@@ o@@ to P@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the strategy for su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development , which is going to be taken up for discussion in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g , will be se@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ ly com@@ pr@@ om@@ ised if the EU does not take a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated g@@ ri@@ p on these energy issues .
Commissioner P@@ ro@@ d@@ i raised the issue very c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ab@@ ly , and many other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers have done the same .
the question is whether the Swedish Government will be pre@@ pa@@ red to think again .
finally , I wish to say that I , just like Mr O@@ l@@ le S@@ ch@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ t , would have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed to have seen a f@@ ou@@ r@@ th &apos; E &apos; , st@@ an@@ ding for em@@ pa@@ th@@ y and re@@ la@@ ting not only to the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e issues but also to relations with the T@@ h@@ ir@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d .
re@@ f@@ er@@ ence has been made here today to the T@@ ob@@ in tax , but I think that this will be im@@ possible to implement .
one way of acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ting more money for g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al issues would be to encourage all Member States to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l their commitment to g@@ i@@ v@@ ing 0@@ .@@ 7 per c@@ ent of their G@@ N@@ P in aid .
in addition to this , as Mrs C@@ ar@@ l@@ s@@ s@@ on said , the ra@@ tes of d@@ u@@ ty on products from de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing countries should be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed .
is the Swedish Government pre@@ pa@@ red to ac@@ t in this s@@ p@@ ir@@ it ?
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this debate has made it very clear that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of Members of the European Parliament is dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by the ou@@ t@@ come of Nice .
the real reason is as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws . in Nice , transparency and democracy for the European Union f@@ el@@ l by the w@@ a@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e .
what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed ?
we find the Council ap@@ pl@@ ying the qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity principle in more and more areas .
that pre@@ v@@ ents any s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y by the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e decisions can , of course , be ou@@ t@@ voted by the res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive ma@@ j@@ or@@ ities in the Council .
but this d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y has , unfortunately , not been re@@ pla@@ c@@ ed by d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y by the European Parliament n@@ or , unfortunately , by c@@ od@@ ec@@ is@@ i@@ on by the European Parliament .
here , I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed , li@@ es the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ness of what was dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed in Nice .
Mr President of the Council , Sweden has a great tra@@ d@@ ition of democracy and transparency .
I ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the Swedish Presidency to support us in our en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y these w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ ses of Nice and to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ c@@ y of d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c decisions in the European Union again , and I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed it will do so .
I want to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s a second point .
during its term of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e the Swedish Presidency must pre@@ par@@ e for the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the e@@ ur@@ o , i@@ .@@ e@@ . of the no@@ tes and co@@ in@@ s , in 1@@ 2 European Union countries .
the question we k@@ e@@ e@@ p as@@ king ourselves is this : who actually re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the e@@ ur@@ o ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally ?
I am per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed that the European Commission ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to under@@ take to do more here than it has to d@@ ate .
the French Presidency g@@ a@@ ve us clear information .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , the p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the 1@@ 2 EU countries re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the e@@ ur@@ o ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
that in t@@ u@@ r@@ n le@@ ad@@ s to a par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ ical situation .
the Swedish F@@ in@@ ance Minister re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the European Union ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally for general economic policy qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons , while when it comes to the e@@ ur@@ o , to the e@@ ur@@ o c@@ ur@@ r@@ ency , this j@@ o@@ b g@@ o@@ es to the B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ an F@@ in@@ ance Minister .
if even we in the European Parliament cannot understand that , how are the citizens of the European Union su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to understand it ?
how are the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts to understand it ?
we must do our ou@@ t@@ most to re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n to a s@@ en@@ si@@ ble situation here .
you , F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister , can make a major contribution here .
if you man@@ age to per@@ su@@ ad@@ e your f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w @-@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ m@@ en that the e@@ ur@@ o is a good pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , that it is st@@ able from within , that its external st@@ ability is also con@@ st@@ an@@ tly im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing ; if you can per@@ su@@ ad@@ e them to support this great pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t of European in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion , you will also help ensure that the citizens g@@ a@@ in a better under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of this as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the European Union .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
question T@@ im@@ e ( Council )
the next it@@ e@@ m is Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion T@@ im@@ e ( B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 1 / 2001 ) .
we will ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to the Council .
question No 1 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 5@@ 2 / 00 ) :
subject : EU @-@ C@@ h@@ in@@ a S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it I@@ n a new report the I@@ O@@ M re@@ v@@ e@@ als that the C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e w@@ h@@ ite s@@ la@@ ve ma@@ f@@ i@@ a is very well or@@ g@@ an@@ ised and that women are being s@@ ol@@ d on mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts throughout C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
the prof@@ its are com@@ par@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y high ( often over EUR 3@@ 0 000 ) and the I@@ O@@ M fe@@ ar@@ s there will be a d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c increase in tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e women both in@@ ter@@ n@@ ally and to W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe in particular .
at the EU @-@ C@@ h@@ in@@ a meeting on 2@@ 3 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2000 the European Council and Commission dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the question of responsibility for the re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation of il@@ legal C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts .
did the Council also bring up the problem of the w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e women and g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s ?
the Council f@@ el@@ t that it was a very positive development to be able to open a dialogue with C@@ h@@ in@@ a concerning m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion issues , particularly those concerning il@@ legal m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and re@@ p@@ at@@ ri@@ ation of C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e citizens who have been f@@ ou@@ n@@ d re@@ si@@ d@@ ing il@@ le@@ g@@ ally on Member States &apos; ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y .
p@@ ri@@ or to the su@@ m@@ m@@ it meeting with C@@ h@@ in@@ a , a meeting was held in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s with o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als from the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency , the Commission and a C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in order to i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy and establish areas of possible future cooperation .
particular em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s was pla@@ c@@ ed on the ex@@ change of information between authorities and organisations working on issues concerning tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s and il@@ legal m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
there are pl@@ ans for further m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s of the same nature , and the next one will be held in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing in a few w@@ e@@ e@@ ks &apos; time .
pre@@ par@@ ations for the meeting are currently under way at ex@@ per@@ t level .
as Mrs T@@ he@@ or@@ in un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly is aware , the European Council in S@@ an@@ t@@ a M@@ ar@@ i@@ a d@@ a F@@ e@@ ir@@ a ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its concern regarding the tra@@ g@@ i@@ c e@@ v@@ ents in D@@ over last year and con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ed the c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al ac@@ ts com@@ m@@ it@@ ted by per@@ s@@ ons prof@@ it@@ e@@ er@@ ing by such s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling of human be@@ in@@ g@@ s .
the European Council g@@ a@@ ve the Union the ta@@ s@@ k of in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ f@@ ying cooperation in order to com@@ b@@ at such c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order c@@ r@@ im@@ e .
the French Presidency res@@ p@@ on@@ ded to the ur@@ g@@ ent request by the European Council and put forward se@@ ver@@ al initiatives as el@@ em@@ ents in the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against the c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks which or@@ g@@ an@@ ise s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling and tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s .
even if the specific problem mentioned by Mrs T@@ he@@ or@@ in was not dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed at the EU @-@ C@@ h@@ in@@ a meeting on 2@@ 3 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er of last year , the Council is very much aware of the problem concerning tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women and g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s .
it is about tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king not only from C@@ h@@ in@@ a , but also from certain other countries not far from the EU .
as the country h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency , Sweden has , in the a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n of the year 2000 and in the context of the A@@ S@@ E@@ M c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation ( in which C@@ h@@ in@@ a also ta@@ k@@ es part ) , raised the issue of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women and children .
the first st@@ e@@ p was an ex@@ per@@ ts &apos; meeting at the end of N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er last year att@@ en@@ ded by ex@@ per@@ ts in the field from both A@@ si@@ a and Europe .
the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations from this meeting will be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted at A@@ S@@ E@@ M &apos; s meeting of F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n M@@ in@@ is@@ ters in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing in M@@ a@@ y of this year .
Swedish Presidency , I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that this issue is being t@@ re@@ ated s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly by the Council , because it is extremely serious .
T@@ E@@ N@@ s of th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of women and g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s are b@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t and s@@ ol@@ d in C@@ h@@ in@@ a every year , many of them to the W@@ est .
the most p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r areas are the p@@ o@@ or pro@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ es .
in a new report , I@@ O@@ M has st@@ a@@ ted that the authorities in the W@@ est have m@@ e@@ t with quite serious di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es when they have t@@ ri@@ ed to get to g@@ ri@@ p@@ s with tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women from C@@ h@@ in@@ a , and that this tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king will increase d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally if for@@ c@@ e@@ ful measures are not em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed .
tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women is also ri@@ f@@ e within C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
as a di@@ rec@@ t con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of the one @-@ ch@@ il@@ d policy and the pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence of C@@ h@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ e f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies for s@@ ons , there are currently 7@@ 0 million un@@ mar@@ ri@@ ed men in C@@ h@@ in@@ a .
the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ o@@ al@@ ition against T@@ ra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in W@@ om@@ en reports on to@@ w@@ n c@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ il@@ s b@@ u@@ ying h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of women who are then d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted to the s@@ in@@ g@@ le men in the to@@ w@@ n on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds that they are to be p@@ it@@ i@@ ed .
it is a very good th@@ ing that you for@@ m@@ ed this c@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l after the D@@ over s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al .
I w@@ on@@ d@@ er whether the ex@@ per@@ t organisations , for example I@@ O@@ M and the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ o@@ al@@ ition against T@@ ra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in W@@ om@@ en , will be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in this Council .
in what way is the Council pre@@ pa@@ red , by using its con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with C@@ h@@ in@@ a , to bring the matter of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women in C@@ h@@ in@@ a to the for@@ e ?
there is every reason for the working parties which have now been ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted to qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y make con@@ ta@@ c@@ t , within the framework of the Union &apos;s work , with other international organisations working with these issues .
I@@ O@@ M is pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly the organisation with the most ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise in the area .
I as@@ su@@ me that such con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts will be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
allow me also to point out that the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in women is in general under@@ l@@ in@@ ed as an important issue in the programme of the Swedish Presidency .
we will g@@ la@@ d@@ ly work towards com@@ b@@ ating this d@@ re@@ ad@@ ful p@@ h@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on on a b@@ road f@@ r@@ on@@ t , that is to say , not only with regard to C@@ h@@ in@@ a , but g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ ally .
as the a@@ u@@ th@@ or is not present , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion No 2 la@@ p@@ ses .
question No 3 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 5@@ 6 / 00 ) :
subject : f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities for EU citizens in M@@ ec@@ c@@ a I@@ n acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 of the E@@ C Treaty , every c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of the EU is ent@@ it@@ led to protection in third countries by the con@@ su@@ late of another Member State if the c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en &apos; s own country is not re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted there .
what f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities are pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the EU for EU citizens in M@@ ec@@ c@@ a during the H@@ a@@ j ?
the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member should be made aware that two decisions have been adopted in ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 20 of the E@@ C Treaty .
the first concerns assistance for citizens of the European Union from the di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c and con@@ su@@ la@@ r re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions .
the second re@@ la@@ tes to implementation measures for the a@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned decisions .
the an@@ n@@ e@@ x to this decision st@@ a@@ tes the conditions under which the Member States &apos; di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions may as@@ s@@ is@@ t each EU c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en .
the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m is pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing con@@ su@@ la@@ r services in M@@ ec@@ c@@ a during the H@@ a@@ j p@@ il@@ g@@ ri@@ ma@@ ge .
there are se@@ ver@@ al con@@ su@@ la@@ tes in J@@ ed@@ d@@ a@@ h which can as@@ s@@ is@@ t EU citizens during the p@@ il@@ g@@ ri@@ ma@@ ge .
Mr President , I thank the Swedish re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive for his re@@ p@@ ly but it does not sa@@ t@@ is@@ fy my en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
he is quite right to say that certain t@@ y@@ p@@ es of con@@ su@@ la@@ r services are pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed in M@@ ec@@ c@@ a during the H@@ a@@ j@@ j by the U@@ K Government for B@@ r@@ it@@ ish M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ im@@ s .
however , those con@@ su@@ la@@ r services are not available to M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ im@@ s from other EU Member States who would be there under the same terms and conditions op@@ er@@ ated by the S@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ i authorities as U@@ K M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ im@@ s .
it se@@ em@@ s a little b@@ i@@ z@@ ar@@ r@@ e that w@@ h@@ il@@ st we are su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to have e@@ qu@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and t@@ re@@ at@@ ment for all EU citizens , in c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es like the one I have d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed , there is u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment and u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion for EU citizens .
could the Swedish min@@ is@@ ter p@@ le@@ a@@ se as@@ sure us that he will take up this matter and ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in which this kind of u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment ta@@ k@@ es place , to ensure that re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ on or n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity people rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the same t@@ re@@ at@@ ment from con@@ su@@ la@@ r services by in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States ?
I can not only as@@ sure Mr B@@ o@@ we that the matter will be taken up , I can even re@@ as@@ sure h@@ i@@ m that his concern is s@@ om@@ e@@ what un@@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded .
the decision that I re@@ f@@ er@@ red to pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tes that if the per@@ s@@ on se@@ e@@ king con@@ su@@ la@@ r help is a c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of one of the Member States of the European Union , the di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c or con@@ su@@ la@@ r re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion from another Member State shall t@@ re@@ at the per@@ s@@ on se@@ e@@ king help as if he were a c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of the Member State re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by the em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y or con@@ su@@ late .
there is therefore no need for the dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y situation fe@@ a@@ re@@ d by Mr B@@ o@@ we to ar@@ ise . in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , an EU c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en will be t@@ re@@ ated e@@ qu@@ ally .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that , in this case , the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m &apos;s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion is ac@@ ting with s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and t@@ re@@ ating all EU citizens e@@ qu@@ ally .
this is at least st@@ a@@ ted in the decisions that have been taken .
question No 4 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 5@@ 7 / 00 ) :
subject : market monitoring and the E@@ C la@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ing system I@@ s it possible at present to guarantee an a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate level of e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent market monitoring with regard to com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of E@@ C la@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ing at European level ?
the Council is very k@@ e@@ en to have effective market monitoring so that it is possible to be sure that the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of the directives re@@ la@@ ting to E@@ C la@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ing and d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up on the basis of the &apos; new approach &apos; are com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with .
this approach is a new way of h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for products in the directives .
the monitoring of how this E@@ C la@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ing of products is used is a common concern for the Commission and the Member States .
it is pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y the Member States &apos; responsibility to ensure , by means of ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l or in some other way , that these bo@@ di@@ es com@@ p@@ ly with the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for com@@ p@@ et@@ ence and that they op@@ er@@ ate e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
the Commission has been as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed a c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l role for en@@ sur@@ ing uni@@ for@@ m@@ ity and a high st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d with regard to the monitoring bo@@ di@@ es .
the su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y bo@@ di@@ es are national , and the Member States no@@ ti@@ fy the Commission of which national bo@@ di@@ es are to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out the control .
in t@@ u@@ r@@ n , the Commission se@@ ts up programmes to ensure that the market monitoring is or@@ g@@ an@@ ised in a uni@@ form way between the Member States .
in order to m@@ on@@ it@@ or the new approach , the bo@@ di@@ es w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e n@@ a@@ m@@ es have been no@@ ti@@ fied by the Member States will , for example , establish c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation groups for each directive .
. ( de ) Mr President , the E@@ C la@@ be@@ l is an important f@@ ac@@ to@@ r of con@@ su@@ m@@ er protection .
but it is a pu@@ re@@ ly qu@@ an@@ t@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ ve m@@ e@@ a@@ sure .
all that is necessary is to pro@@ ve com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing European legal pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons .
that is certainly not enough for the con@@ su@@ m@@ er .
con@@ su@@ m@@ ers also want quality te@@ st@@ ing and c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication procedures so that they can find out whether a pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t is of above @-@ a@@ ver@@ age st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d and therefore also m@@ e@@ et@@ s their re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
that is why third @-@ par@@ ty c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication is quite c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al , especially for safety com@@ p@@ on@@ ents .
we sa@@ w from the ra@@ i@@ l acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent in E@@ s@@ ch@@ ed@@ e that very serious accidents can o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r if the ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s only do their own monitoring , without any third @-@ par@@ ty c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication .
do you think that in future we should place more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on third @-@ par@@ ty c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication in the European Union ?
as I said e@@ ar@@ li@@ er in my in@@ it@@ i@@ al re@@ p@@ ly to the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member , in the first place it is the Commission which is to ensure uni@@ for@@ m@@ ity with regard to the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of so @-@ called com@@ p@@ li@@ an@@ c@@ es .
I would therefore like to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e that , in the first in@@ st@@ ance , the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member t@@ u@@ r@@ n to the Commission for any further information concerning this matter .
question No 5 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 6@@ 5 / 00 ) :
subject : h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e by political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkey T@@ he s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ e of death is ha@@ un@@ ting d@@ o@@ z@@ en@@ s of political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkey who have been on a h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e to the death for the past two m@@ on@@ th@@ s in pro@@ te@@ st at the in@@ human conditions in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons .
at the same time , the Council of Europe has an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed that t@@ or@@ ture con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to be st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d practice in Turkish p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e st@@ ations , while A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national has d@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed the t@@ or@@ ture , the im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity and the general v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of human rights by Turkey and called on the European Union to d@@ em@@ and an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate end to t@@ or@@ ture and not in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 , as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the procedure for Turkey &apos;s acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion to the Union .
will the Council make re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions to the Turkish Government to take measures to improve the situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons so that the pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers also end their h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e ?
will it adopt A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national &apos;s call for an im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate end to t@@ or@@ ture in the context of the procedure for Turkey &apos;s acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion to the European Union ?
the Turkish Government is , in all pro@@ b@@ ability , well aware of the Union &apos;s f@@ ir@@ m con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion that the situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons needs to be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed and t@@ or@@ ture ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
the Council w@@ el@@ comes the fact that Turkey has be@@ gu@@ n a reform of the pr@@ is@@ on system and that the country is also w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate with the European Committee for the P@@ re@@ v@@ en@@ tion of T@@ or@@ ture .
t@@ or@@ ture is one of the most p@@ res@@ sing problems in Turkey .
the Council has also given the issue priority in the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p agreement that ex@@ is@@ t@@ s for the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion of Turkey , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally by re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing legislation and taking all measures necessary to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against t@@ or@@ ture and to ensure that the European Committee for the P@@ re@@ v@@ en@@ tion of T@@ or@@ ture is o@@ be@@ y@@ ed .
this means a@@ m@@ on@@ g other things that the Council ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ts Turkey to make si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant progress in this area before the end of this year .
with regard to the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons , the EU has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly d@@ em@@ an@@ ded a pr@@ is@@ on system in Turkey which con@@ for@@ m@@ s to international st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds .
therefore , in its m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ term priorities in the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p agreement for acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion , the Council has in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment that conditions in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons be ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed to con@@ form to the UN &apos;s rules as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds min@@ im@@ u@@ m st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds for the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
with regard to the li@@ v@@ es which have unfortunately been l@@ o@@ s@@ t during the recent ri@@ o@@ t@@ s in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons and the report on t@@ or@@ ture and ab@@ use during the transport of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , the European Union has raised the issue in b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with Turkish authorities .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , the EU does not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate t@@ or@@ ture and ab@@ use of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
in their con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts with the EU , the Turkish authorities have d@@ en@@ i@@ ed all al@@ le@@ g@@ ations of t@@ or@@ ture and ab@@ use .
the Council will , of course , continue to m@@ on@@ it@@ or the situation c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y .
I too am one of the members who have h@@ u@@ ge h@@ op@@ es of the Swedish Presidency on the question of human rights , because it is the presidency of a country which has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n through its de@@ ed@@ s that it has t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ous com@@ pa@@ s@@ sion and that it is re@@ v@@ ol@@ ted by op@@ por@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ m when it comes to human rights issues .
and I should like to say that the President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos;s &quot; y@@ es , but &quot; st@@ ance wor@@ ri@@ es me s@@ om@@ e@@ what sa@@ ying that the Council will continue to m@@ on@@ it@@ or de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments , that there may have been some un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents , but Turkey has given its as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es that nothing is a@@ mis@@ s .
allow me just to re@@ mind you that , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the Council , the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p agreement with Turkey , which currently ex@@ is@@ t@@ s in d@@ ra@@ f@@ t form , o@@ f@@ f@@ ers an excellent opportunity for con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally &apos; k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing a ti@@ g@@ h@@ t re@@ i@@ g@@ n &apos; on Turkey when it comes to t@@ or@@ ture , the conditions in pr@@ is@@ ons and human rights in general .
the Council n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to use all opportunities that ex@@ is@@ t within the framework of this agreement to ensure that de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in Turkey he@@ a@@ d in a di@@ rec@@ tion which is com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with the common v@@ al@@ u@@ es we h@@ ol@@ d in the EU .
a large pro@@ por@@ tion of the pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons must be re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
in Turkey , people are also still being con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted on political g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds .
I was present m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f at a t@@ ri@@ al on 2@@ 1 December last year in D@@ j@@ ar@@ b@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ r in s@@ ou@@ th @-@ e@@ a@@ st Turkey where a S@@ y@@ ri@@ an p@@ ri@@ est was th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed with three years in pr@@ is@@ on for simply t@@ al@@ king about the g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e com@@ m@@ it@@ ted against the A@@ r@@ m@@ en@@ i@@ ans and A@@ s@@ s@@ y@@ ri@@ ans in 1@@ 9@@ 1@@ 5 .
this was his only &apos; c@@ r@@ im@@ e &apos; , and for this he was to be con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted .
will the Council d@@ em@@ and ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to Turkish c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al law and ra@@ ise specific cases like this one , in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing people being im@@ pr@@ is@@ on@@ ed on political g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds ?
in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al fact , I can an@@ s@@ w@@ er Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t &apos;s question in the same way as I an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous question .
in dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ing Turkey an ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant country for m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the EU , which was done at the H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it , the EU now has com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly new opportunities of c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y following de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in Turkey and of p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out every de@@ v@@ i@@ ation from the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds which should apply to a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate country .
I therefore see it as a very ur@@ g@@ ent ta@@ s@@ k , also under the Swedish Presidency , to ensure that de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in Turkey pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed in such a way that we can gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally see the country draw n@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ r to the European family in a more con@@ c@@ re@@ te way than we have seen up to now .
question No 6 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 6@@ 7 / 00 ) :
subject : open Council m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s T@@ he Swedish Presidency has dec@@ la@@ red op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s to be t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ou@@ s@@ ly important to the work of the European Union .
how many of the Council m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s to be held during the Swedish Presidency between 1 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary and 3@@ 0 J@@ un@@ e 2001 will be com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly open to the public ?
as has un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly also em@@ er@@ ged from the p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of the work programme by the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister a sh@@ or@@ t while ago , the Swedish Presidency at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es particular importance to the work of the Council &apos; s being open and acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ble to European citizens and to le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive work &apos; s being open to public s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ in@@ y .
the Swedish Presidency is ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y working towards making as many de@@ b@@ a@@ tes as possible open within the for@@ ma@@ l f@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ wor@@ ks which apply .
the Council &apos;s R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e do not per@@ m@@ it com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly public Council m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s , which is something Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t is also aware of .
however , public Council de@@ b@@ a@@ tes can be held .
in H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i in December 1999 the European Council dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed that , on a h@@ al@@ f @-@ y@@ e@@ ar@@ ly basis , the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council and the E@@ co@@ f@@ in Council should h@@ ol@@ d public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes on the Council &apos;s work programme .
this decision has now been in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated into the Council &apos;s R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
other Council con@@ st@@ el@@ la@@ tions are also h@@ ol@@ ding public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes .
one of the first priorities of the Swedish Presidency was therefore to draw up a l@@ is@@ t of public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes which were to co@@ v@@ er as large an area as possible of the Council &apos;s work .
therefore , we have now p@@ res@@ en@@ ted a l@@ is@@ t of the public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes which are to be held during our presidency .
n@@ ine such de@@ b@@ a@@ tes will be held in what could be re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as the important and c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l Council con@@ st@@ el@@ la@@ tions be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing this F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y when E@@ co@@ f@@ in is to h@@ ol@@ d a debate on its work programme .
following this , the de@@ b@@ a@@ tes continue during the first h@@ al@@ f of the year up to the last public debate in the Council ( c@@ ul@@ ture ) which , in J@@ un@@ e , shall dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the protection of min@@ or@@ s against d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ ing con@@ t@@ ent in the m@@ ed@@ i@@ a .
with these measures , we have taken transparency in the work of the Council a st@@ e@@ p further .
there are un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly further st@@ e@@ p@@ s to be taken , but , Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t , do not allow the best to become the en@@ em@@ y of the good .
no , I shall not allow the best to become the en@@ em@@ y of the good .
it is just that if we continue at the pa@@ ce of the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters it will be a h@@ un@@ d@@ red years before we have public m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s for real .
n@@ ine de@@ b@@ a@@ tes are actually not particularly im@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve , if I may say so .
I think that it should be a matter of course in a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c society for the citizens to have the right of access to their most important le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive b@@ od@@ y , and in the European Union that is of course l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y the EU &apos;s Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters .
it is quite simply a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l d@@ em@@ and for democracy .
if it is now the case that the Council &apos;s R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e pre@@ v@@ ent even the v@@ o@@ ting and the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e Council m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s where the Council is , so to speak , le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ ting from being open , we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to change these an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
will there , therefore , be no such initiative from the Swedish Presidency , which is pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing the issues re@@ la@@ ting to op@@ en@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s so in@@ t@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y - which is something I regard as im@@ m@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y important and positive ?
as Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly aware , the Swedish Presidency in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to use all the energy i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ able to t@@ r@@ y to mo@@ ve the situation forward with regard to the question of transparency during Sweden &apos;s h@@ al@@ f @-@ year of h@@ ol@@ ding the presidency .
we think that we are pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly doing this with the in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d number of de@@ b@@ a@@ tes that are open .
we can draw par@@ al@@ l@@ el@@ s with most national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments .
take , for example , the Swedish Parliament .
the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive work in the com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es in the Swedish Parliament is not public but c@@ l@@ o@@ sed , and there are reasons for this .
there is a need to be able to agree p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally , but there is of course also a need for ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m transparency .
I can as@@ sure you , Mr S@@ j@@ ö@@ st@@ ed@@ t , that we will do all we can to mo@@ ve the situation forward , but R@@ om@@ e was not b@@ u@@ il@@ t in a day .
even a long mar@@ ch be@@ g@@ in@@ s with a small st@@ e@@ p .

B@@ el@@ ar@@ us , a n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our of the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries of L@@ at@@ v@@ i@@ a , L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ i@@ a and P@@ ol@@ and , is a country in which n@@ one of the above three pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es can be said to be u@@ p@@ held in an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble m@@ an@@ n@@ er and there is clearly a r@@ is@@ k that the effects may s@@ pre@@ a@@ d to the sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding countries .
on 1@@ 6 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2000 in M@@ in@@ s@@ k , the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a of the EU , the Council of Europe and the O@@ S@@ C@@ E d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ red a sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ly c@@ r@@ it@@ ical report on the lack of democracy in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the el@@ ec@@ tions held there .
the many people who have dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de for@@ m@@ er I@@ n@@ te@@ ri@@ or Minister Y@@ u@@ ri@@ y Z@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ ar@@ en@@ k@@ o , for@@ m@@ er D@@ e@@ pu@@ ty C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an V@@ ic@@ to@@ r G@@ on@@ c@@ ha@@ r , and the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an f@@ il@@ m @-@ ma@@ k@@ er , D@@ m@@ it@@ ri@@ y Z@@ a@@ va@@ d@@ s@@ k@@ i@@ y .
what p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al initiatives does the Swedish Presidency in@@ t@@ end to take to promote an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in democracy in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us and what measures and st@@ e@@ p@@ s will be taken to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed to those who have dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d ?
unfortunately , the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly right in sa@@ ying that democracy , human rights and the principle of the r@@ u@@ le of law are not res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted in an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble way in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .
the Council is well aware of the situation that has pre@@ va@@ il@@ ed for a long time in that country and is following the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments very c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y .
the EU has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly ap@@ p@@ e@@ al@@ ed to the authorities in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us to respect international st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds in these extremely important areas .
at the same time , the European Union has made the most of every opportunity to encourage the development of a he@@ al@@ th@@ y civil society in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .
the Swedish Presidency will , with great res@@ ol@@ ve , continue the efforts of the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es to encourage im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in democracy in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .
the Council fe@@ el@@ s that it is only through such im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents that the people of B@@ el@@ ar@@ us can fully ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise their power over the future of the country .
by v@@ o@@ ting in a new p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent , the people will get the ch@@ ance this year to take a c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al decision on what their future will h@@ ol@@ d .
within the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant f@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ wor@@ ks , the Council will o@@ f@@ f@@ er the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c p@@ o@@ w@@ ers every en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement to guarantee that v@@ o@@ ters have a real and c@@ re@@ di@@ ble c@@ h@@ o@@ ice of c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes .
the EU &apos; s support of civil society , in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al organisations and m@@ ed@@ i@@ a is an important el@@ ement in f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ ing democracy .
as a n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our of L@@ at@@ v@@ i@@ a , L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ i@@ a and P@@ ol@@ and , B@@ el@@ ar@@ us will s@@ o@@ on b@@ order an en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed EU .
therefore , the Council is particularly k@@ e@@ en that , in the long term , B@@ el@@ ar@@ us is e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed as a par@@ t@@ n@@ er and it is also k@@ e@@ en to ensure st@@ ability in the region as a whole .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , the Council has com@@ p@@ le@@ te con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence that the new d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ i@@ es in the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries will more than c@@ op@@ e with the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es they may come up against .
the three countries mentioned have all pla@@ y@@ ed an important and ac@@ tive part through their b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c relations with B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , they can s@@ er@@ ve as v@@ al@@ u@@ able ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es to B@@ el@@ ar@@ us when it comes to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s with regard to re@@ for@@ m@@ s and democracy .
like these countries , the EU has ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed that a policy which a@@ im@@ s to is@@ ol@@ ate B@@ el@@ ar@@ us would m@@ il@@ it@@ ate against its own objective .
therefore , the EU has st@@ ri@@ v@@ en to k@@ e@@ e@@ p the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation ch@@ an@@ n@@ el@@ s with the authorities in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us open and o@@ f@@ f@@ er them in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es to improve relations .
at the same time , the Union has con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed to ex@@ er@@ t p@@ res@@ sure for the country to h@@ on@@ our its com@@ m@@ it@@ ments and to give the O@@ S@@ C@@ E A@@ s@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ance and M@@ on@@ it@@ or@@ ing Group the freedom to ac@@ t when it at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l its ta@@ s@@ k .
during the com@@ ing w@@ e@@ e@@ ks , the Union will once more present its point of view di@@ rec@@ tly to the authorities in M@@ in@@ s@@ k .
the Union will , of course , also take this opportunity to ra@@ ise the issue of people who have rec@@ ently dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d .
it is a great p@@ le@@ a@@ sure and h@@ on@@ our to be able to welcome here L@@ ar@@ s D@@ an@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ s@@ on and the Swedish Presidency .
the Swedish l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , the l@@ an@@ gu@@ age of h@@ on@@ our and h@@ er@@ o@@ es , has pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly n@@ e@@ v@@ er before f@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed in this House as it is doing today .
my w@@ ar@@ m th@@ an@@ ks for your re@@ p@@ ly .
at this point I would like to take up some att@@ en@@ d@@ ant issues .
they concern the political uni@@ on which ex@@ is@@ t@@ s in re@@ al@@ ity between B@@ el@@ ar@@ us and P@@ ol@@ and and the ex@@ t@@ ent to which the Swedish Presidency is also pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing p@@ res@@ sure on R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a , as part of a political uni@@ on with B@@ el@@ ar@@ us , to re@@ al@@ ise the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations , and the im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations for its st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s in the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , of being in a uni@@ on with a country which can h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly be d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed as a democracy .
you mentioned the p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ al el@@ ec@@ tion in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us in 2001 .
but 20 per@@ c@@ ent of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes in the so @-@ called par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y el@@ ec@@ tion last a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n - I was there m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f as an ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ er - were dis@@ mis@@ sed .
I would also like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of the EU taking action so as to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d a pr@@ ol@@ i@@ f@@ er@@ ation effect .
we are , of course , no@@ ti@@ c@@ ing a dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing development , Mr D@@ an@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ s@@ on , in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing country of U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
we cannot un@@ de@@ re@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ te the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us s@@ pre@@ ad@@ ing , for we should n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ get that the re@@ g@@ im@@ e in M@@ in@@ s@@ k in fact has b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d on its h@@ an@@ ds .
I think that it is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly right to see the development in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us , as Mr S@@ ac@@ r@@ é@@ de@@ us does , in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with the development in R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a and the development in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
in the work programme concerning the cooperation between the EU and R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a which the presidency will present in the G@@ en@@ er@@ al Affairs Council on M@@ on@@ day next w@@ e@@ e@@ k , there is much t@@ al@@ k of the need for dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a concerning the s@@ it@@ u@@ ations in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing countries of B@@ el@@ ar@@ us and U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
we hope that we will en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter rather more under@@ st@@ an@@ ding on the part of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a , also with regard to R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a &apos;s responsibility when it comes to actually being able to in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence the development in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us in a positive way .
we will then com@@ b@@ ine this with the ur@@ g@@ ent efforts that I d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed e@@ ar@@ li@@ er in my in@@ it@@ i@@ al re@@ p@@ ly .
we think that it is important to in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence B@@ el@@ ar@@ us , which is of course c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the re@@ st of Europe perhaps than many people think if they have not l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed pro@@ per@@ ly at the ma@@ p .
it is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly essential that we take every opportunity , on the part of the Union , to bring about a development towards democracy in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .

in many cases , this is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ t la@@ ws or the c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying @-@ out of an@@ c@@ e@@ st@@ ra@@ l p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es and tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
the European Union sa@@ y@@ s that it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t women from such un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion and pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ment , but it has not yet f@@ ou@@ n@@ d a way of trans@@ la@@ ting its dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations into political actions and decisions o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for hope .
would the Council be in favour of the ad@@ op@@ tion of measures w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ by such s@@ it@@ u@@ ations a@@ f@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ting women might be con@@ si@@ de@@ red g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for g@@ r@@ an@@ ting a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and re@@ f@@ u@@ ge , in political terms , in the European Union ?
the Council &apos;s bo@@ di@@ es are well aware of the t@@ y@@ p@@ e of per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion and m@@ u@@ ti@@ la@@ tion which the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member mentioned in her question .
within C@@ i@@ re@@ a , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the C@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e for In@@ for@@ ma@@ tion , R@@ e@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ tion and E@@ x@@ change on A@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m , the situation in a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers &apos; different countries of or@@ i@@ g@@ in is m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally .
the f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s which are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed here will be taken into account when the Member States deal with a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations from those who have been su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to such ac@@ ts of c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty .
it should , however , be p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out that the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence from the st@@ u@@ di@@ es which C@@ i@@ re@@ a has carried out s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that women who are su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , ra@@ p@@ e or m@@ u@@ ti@@ la@@ tion do not always give these reasons as the main g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for their a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation .
as the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member will un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly rec@@ all , agreement was re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed at the T@@ a@@ m@@ per@@ e S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it in 1999 to work towards e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a common European a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m system based on a com@@ p@@ le@@ te and ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing that no @-@ one is s@@ ent back to be su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion , and that this system should in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de an ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ tion of the rules for the rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition and con@@ t@@ ent of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s .
the Council has also agreed that this system should be su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted by measures for other for@@ m@@ s of protection which provide a su@@ it@@ able st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s for those in need of such protection .
in December of last year , the Council was un@@ ited in re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing a number of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons concerning how a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers should be received .
these con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , which will form the basis for the proposal for a Council directive which the Commission will ta@@ ble in the s@@ pr@@ ing , con@@ ta@@ in , a@@ m@@ on@@ g other things , pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons st@@ ating that h@@ o@@ s@@ t Member States shall provide s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t health c@@ are to a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers who have been su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to t@@ or@@ ture , ra@@ p@@ e or other serious ac@@ ts of c@@ r@@ u@@ el@@ ty .
the Council is now a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing the Commission &apos;s proposal and , when it ar@@ ri@@ v@@ es , the Swedish Presidency in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to t@@ re@@ at it as a priority issue .
the Commission has also ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its in@@ t@@ en@@ tion to ta@@ ble a proposal la@@ ter this year for rules for the rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition and con@@ t@@ ent of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s and su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y for@@ m@@ s of protection .
the question of how g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ based per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion will be con@@ si@@ de@@ red in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion within the Union will un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly be the subject of th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s .
I would like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council whether he is in favour of women being t@@ re@@ ated as in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als , for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses of v@@ is@@ as and a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s in the European Union , without having to be de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on a h@@ u@@ s@@ b@@ and or gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , are you in favour of our t@@ re@@ ating women as@@ king for a visa or for a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m as people in their own right ?
I would ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate an an@@ s@@ w@@ er , one I hope will be y@@ es .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , I am in favour of such a s@@ ch@@ em@@ e .
each in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al will of course be t@@ re@@ ated p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y as an in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al .
we must also re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that in many a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m cases we are de@@ al@@ ing with family re@@ uni@@ ons of different k@@ in@@ ds .
in that case it may mean that if part of a family has been g@@ r@@ an@@ ted a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m , that will a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation of a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m for other members of the same family .
then we are , of course , de@@ v@@ i@@ ating s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly from the principle of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment , but the b@@ a@@ si@@ c an@@ s@@ w@@ er to the M@@ E@@ P &apos; s question is : y@@ es .

in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion the Council also no@@ tes and w@@ el@@ comes the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a working par@@ ty within the UN which will draw up general re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations on im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing UN s@@ an@@ c@@ tions , on how they are to be better di@@ rec@@ ted and on how to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d un@@ necessary human su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing .
I should like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his an@@ s@@ w@@ er and also to wish h@@ i@@ m well for the Swedish Presidency .
however , as a follow @-@ up to what he has already st@@ a@@ ted , does the presidency feel that the op@@ er@@ ation of the C@@ om@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion Commission on I@@ ra@@ q , which is based in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , should continue ?
as you know , this com@@ mis@@ sion also de@@ als with the question of re@@ par@@ ations in the a@@ f@@ ter@@ ma@@ th of the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r .
we have already seen the n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve effects in pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ ity terms of the s@@ an@@ c@@ tions and how they are being used by S@@ ad@@ d@@ am H@@ u@@ s@@ se@@ in to be@@ at W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe , as well as the A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ ans and the UN , and to r@@ ally his people back .
the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment last n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t was that this was a v@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y of good over e@@ v@@ i@@ l and that S@@ ad@@ d@@ am H@@ u@@ s@@ se@@ in was good and the re@@ st of the world was e@@ v@@ i@@ l .
we are pla@@ ying into his h@@ an@@ ds by en@@ sur@@ ing that people are d@@ en@@ i@@ ed access to m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es , food and the other n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ities of life .
I think it is important to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ es for being able to li@@ f@@ t the s@@ an@@ c@@ tions against I@@ ra@@ q are that the I@@ ra@@ q@@ i re@@ g@@ im@@ e co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ tes fully , in particular with the UN &apos;s in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ s , with regard to the control of whether I@@ ra@@ q still has access to weapons of ma@@ s@@ s d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion .
this is also the dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve point for the Union when it comes to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing possible ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to the s@@ an@@ c@@ tions .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the UN C@@ om@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion Committee based in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a , which , as you know , has been working since the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ a@@ r to se@@ t@@ t@@ le c@@ la@@ im@@ s re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from the war , I think it is s@@ en@@ si@@ ble to w@@ a@@ it for an as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment from the UN of how this work is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing before we in the Union take a st@@ and on whether or not this ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity will continue .
allow me to st@@ res@@ s that I believe it to be necessary for us in the Union , from a general point of view , to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to this discussion of principle on the s@@ an@@ c@@ tions in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment itself and its effects .
we have many ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es today of good political g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing s@@ an@@ c@@ tions against a particular country , but we have di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in en@@ sur@@ ing that these s@@ an@@ c@@ tions actually a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t those we want them to a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the governments in these countries .
I think that , on the part of the Council , there is every reason , both as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds I@@ ra@@ q and in general , to continue the discussion on the form the s@@ an@@ c@@ tions in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment should take .
as the a@@ u@@ th@@ or is not present , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion No 1@@ 0 la@@ p@@ ses .
Mrs F@@ er@@ re@@ r as@@ k@@ ed me to take over her question and said she would in@@ for@@ m the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant s@@ er@@ v@@ ice acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
Mr V@@ an H@@ ec@@ k@@ e , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e , a w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en no@@ te should have been s@@ ent to in@@ d@@ ic@@ ate that you were taking over the question , as has been done in the case of Mr C@@ ro@@ w@@ le@@ y .
I must apply the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
my h@@ an@@ ds are ti@@ ed in this matter .
I am very s@@ or@@ r@@ y .
since they deal with the same subject , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 1@@ 1 and 1@@ 2 will be taken together .
question No 1@@ 1 by G@@ l@@ en@@ y@@ s K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 8@@ 3 / 00 ) :
subject : B@@ ur@@ m@@ a
could the Council give an as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the progress , or o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , being made through their policy of &apos; con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement &apos; with the military re@@ g@@ im@@ e in R@@ an@@ g@@ o@@ on ?
question No 1@@ 2 by R@@ ic@@ h@@ ar@@ d C@@ or@@ b@@ et@@ t ( H @-@ 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 / 00 ) :
subject : A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N and B@@ ur@@ m@@ a
what is the Council &apos; s re@@ action to the A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N meeting of 2@@ 4 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 at which the A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N le@@ ad@@ ers re@@ por@@ te@@ d@@ ly in@@ s@@ is@@ ted that EU m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s with A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N must in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve all t@@ en A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N m@@ em@@ b@@ er st@@ a@@ tes , including B@@ ur@@ m@@ a ?
does the Council agree that re@@ p@@ res@@ sion in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a has actually wor@@ s@@ en@@ ed since the st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing of the EU common position in A@@ p@@ ri@@ l 2000 and that it re@@ ma@@ in@@ s in@@ appropriate to en@@ g@@ age in co@@ op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of that re@@ g@@ im@@ e ?
the Council s@@ ha@@ res the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members &apos; concerns regarding the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r , including the new re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions which have been in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed against the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al L@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e for D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y during recent m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
the Council also no@@ tes the recent re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y positive development th@@ an@@ ks to the en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s made by the United N@@ ations S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al &apos;s S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ y for B@@ ur@@ m@@ a , T@@ an S@@ r@@ i R@@ a@@ z@@ al@@ i I@@ s@@ ma@@ i@@ l , and the op@@ en@@ ing of a ch@@ an@@ n@@ e@@ l for dialogue between A@@ un@@ g S@@ an S@@ u@@ i K@@ y@@ i and the military j@@ un@@ t@@ a .
the Council has on a number of o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its concern in st@@ a@@ te@@ ments and initiatives and in the EU &apos;s C@@ om@@ m@@ on P@@ o@@ s@@ ition of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
the Council has also re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly d@@ em@@ an@@ ded that human rights be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted and specific measures taken towards democracy and national re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation .
the Council would h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ be its policy as con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement , but rather as an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to achieve change by ap@@ pl@@ ying p@@ res@@ sure by means of s@@ an@@ c@@ tions and through di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ es .
as the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member , R@@ ic@@ h@@ ar@@ d C@@ or@@ b@@ et@@ t , re@@ min@@ ded us , the EU &apos;s C@@ om@@ m@@ on P@@ o@@ s@@ ition was ti@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ en@@ ed si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly in A@@ p@@ ri@@ l of last year in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the Council &apos;s concern over the wor@@ s@@ en@@ ing situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
at the same time , the Council agreed to s@@ en@@ d another t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a mis@@ sion to R@@ an@@ g@@ o@@ on .
it se@@ em@@ s now as if the mis@@ sion will be un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en la@@ ter this m@@ on@@ th .
the Union has made it clear , including at the last min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al meeting between the EU and A@@ se@@ an in V@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ an@@ e in December of last year , that they are ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the EU t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a to be given the same opportunities to m@@ e@@ e@@ t all the parties involved , whether they are from the Government , the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al L@@ e@@ ag@@ u@@ e for D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y or e@@ th@@ n@@ i@@ c min@@ or@@ ities .
the min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al meeting in V@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ an@@ e , which B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ ted in , p@@ res@@ en@@ ted an appropriate opportunity not only to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the b@@ on@@ ds which un@@ ite the EU and A@@ se@@ an but also to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s the Union &apos;s concern regarding the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r di@@ rec@@ tly to the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n min@@ is@@ ter .
the Council also w@@ el@@ comes the fact that , in the C@@ om@@ m@@ on P@@ o@@ s@@ ition which was agreed on in V@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ an@@ e , both the EU and A@@ se@@ an under@@ take to support the United N@@ ations S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al &apos;s S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ y for B@@ ur@@ m@@ a , T@@ an S@@ r@@ i R@@ a@@ z@@ al@@ i I@@ s@@ ma@@ i@@ l , in his efforts to bring about positive change in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a .
Mr President , may I also welcome the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office .
I ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the an@@ s@@ w@@ er but I do have to ask , with the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that of course A@@ un@@ g S@@ an S@@ u@@ u K@@ y@@ i has been under v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ al h@@ ou@@ se ar@@ re@@ st now for about 1@@ 20 d@@ a@@ y@@ s : how can you su@@ g@@ g@@ est that a pr@@ is@@ on@@ er is able to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out a m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful dialogue or n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ation with her j@@ a@@ il@@ er ?
that is my first question .
secondly , should not she and the N@@ L@@ D actually be o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red b@@ a@@ si@@ c f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s before we are pre@@ pa@@ red to em@@ b@@ ra@@ ce the S@@ P@@ D@@ C in this way ?
you say that the t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a will have access to areas and to as many in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als as it w@@ an@@ ts .
are you im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing conditions on this t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a v@@ is@@ it , which would mean that they are ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly ob@@ li@@ g@@ ated to give that kind of access ?
finally , just one last sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ al com@@ ment : in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 A@@ un@@ g S@@ an S@@ u@@ u K@@ y@@ i did have some n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ation with the S@@ L@@ O@@ R@@ C , as they were called then , and they said all the time that she was being far too in@@ f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble , this w@@ om@@ an is im@@ possible to deal with because she k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ s as@@ king us to respect the results of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 el@@ ec@@ tion .
I w@@ on@@ d@@ er whether you are concerned that they might be still pla@@ ying g@@ a@@ m@@ es with the European Union and the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity and they will again say : &quot; look , this w@@ om@@ an is im@@ possible . &quot;
firstly , allow me say that I n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally fully share the concern ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed by Mrs K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k regarding the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
the Council has the same b@@ a@@ si@@ c opinion as that ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed by Mrs K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k in her question , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that it is ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous that we must im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent conditions on B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r with regard to human rights .
I would like to re@@ mind you that the European Union is ac@@ tive in se@@ ver@@ al areas with regard to the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t for human rights in that country .
the Union is ac@@ tive within the I@@ L@@ O , in the UN Human Rights Commission and in the UN G@@ en@@ er@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly .
a con@@ d@@ ition for the con@@ ta@@ c@@ ts I have d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed and those which we hope to be able to make at the pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed v@@ is@@ it with the t@@ ro@@ i@@ k@@ a is of course that we rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve full access to all so @-@ called parties in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
this g@@ o@@ es without sa@@ ying , but unfortunately we can now see that the situation in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r is also g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing more un@@ se@@ t@@ t@@ led for other reasons .
there are ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly b@@ order con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts going on now between Bangladesh and M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r , which could also a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the situation within B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
so , allow me to as@@ sure you that the Council fully s@@ ha@@ res Mrs K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k &apos;s concern with regard to the situation .
this does not in any way mean that we should d@@ ance to the t@@ u@@ n@@ e of the B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e Government .
we are making st@@ r@@ on@@ g d@@ em@@ an@@ ds for com@@ p@@ le@@ te acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ bility , with regard to both the N@@ L@@ D and e@@ th@@ n@@ i@@ c min@@ or@@ ities .
the la@@ t@@ ter must not , of course , be for@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ en in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion .
thank you for that very com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
as you know , the next min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al meeting between the EU and the A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N countries is due to take place in Europe .
at the moment we have a b@@ an against tra@@ v@@ e@@ l into any of the EU Member States by any m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the military re@@ g@@ im@@ e in B@@ ur@@ m@@ a and their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies .
they will , therefore , not be able to take part in that meeting .
A@@ S@@ E@@ A@@ N countries are p@@ res@@ sur@@ ing the Union to li@@ f@@ t that b@@ an .
can I have your as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce that you will not give in to such p@@ res@@ sure ?
the Council does not give in to p@@ res@@ sure .
the Council has still not made a decision regarding B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e participation in the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al meeting between the EU and A@@ se@@ an which Mr C@@ or@@ b@@ et@@ t re@@ f@@ er@@ red to .
the Council will e@@ v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ally make a decision on the basis of the C@@ om@@ m@@ on P@@ o@@ s@@ ition ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the Union concerning relations with B@@ ur@@ m@@ a / M@@ y@@ an@@ ma@@ r .
I can as@@ sure Mr C@@ or@@ b@@ et@@ t that we pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly have ex@@ ac@@ tly the same opinion regarding what is necessary for the Council to be able to accept B@@ ur@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e participation in this min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al meeting .
question No 1@@ 3 by ( H @-@ 0@@ 9@@ 8@@ 5 / 00 ) :
subject : fisheries and Swedish Presidency W@@ il@@ l the Council , under the Swedish Presidency , ou@@ t@@ line what level of importance it at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es to the fisheries sector having regard , in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion , to the extremely difficult situation being ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed at present by f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men in I@@ re@@ land and other EU countries and will it ou@@ t@@ line its priorities with regard to the next development programme for the fishing f@@ le@@ e@@ t for the per@@ i@@ o@@ d 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 - 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 ?
it is not clear from the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member &apos; s question whether it is di@@ rec@@ ted at the Council or the Swedish Presidency .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to be able to take the opportunity , as also re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed by the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member , b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly to m@@ en@@ tion a few priorities with regard to the future policy for the Community &apos;s fishing f@@ le@@ e@@ t .
firstly , allow me to say that the presidency at@@ ta@@ ch@@ es great importance to the common fisheries policy and that we are fully aware of the difficult situation f@@ ac@@ ed by the fishing industry after the d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic c@@ u@@ ts in quotas et@@ c@@ . at the Council &apos;s meeting in December of last year .
however , the c@@ u@@ ts were necessary in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the situation regarding f@@ ish st@@ o@@ c@@ ks , particularly with regard to co@@ d and ha@@ k@@ e , and which also a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted a number of other s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies .
as the Council se@@ es it , the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous re@@ m@@ ed@@ y for this situation in the long term is to establish a la@@ st@@ ing b@@ al@@ ance between the fishing c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity and the available resources in order to en@@ able a la@@ st@@ ing and su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ation of li@@ v@@ ing mar@@ ine resources and to sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d the future li@@ v@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ d of the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men .
the presidency therefore in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge a general debate in the Council on the follow @-@ up to the development programmes which have been taking place over se@@ ver@@ al years once the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th of these development programmes has been com@@ p@@ le@@ ted on 3@@ 1 December 2001 .
the Commission will ta@@ ble its proposals in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future .
we are well aware that a b@@ al@@ ance has not been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed by the present programmes and that they have been con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al in certain qu@@ ar@@ ters .
in addition to the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l problems which were s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally mentioned in the question , the presidency &apos;s priorities also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de st@@ ar@@ ting work on the Commission &apos;s g@@ re@@ en pa@@ per on the future of the common fisheries policy and d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up a proposal from the presidency on fishing and the environment , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of environmental issues and the principle of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development in the common fisheries policy .
this is part of the C@@ ar@@ di@@ f@@ f process , and the Council is ob@@ li@@ ged to present such a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment at the meeting of the European Council in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g .
the presidency does not consider there to be much sc@@ op@@ e for taking support measures to the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of an in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member State . rather , the common fisheries policy ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of the fishing sector throughout the Union .
it has su@@ re@@ ly not e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ ed the attention of the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member that the d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic c@@ u@@ ts in fishing opportunities will be f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed by pl@@ ans for the re@@ st@@ or@@ ation of the th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed st@@ o@@ c@@ ks .
in this con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion we have in@@ v@@ ited the European Parliament to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate by su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ing its opinion in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary on the proposal for a rec@@ o@@ very plan for co@@ d in the I@@ r@@ ish S@@ e@@ a , and these measures can come into effect as e@@ ar@@ ly as 1@@ 4 F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary 2001 .
we ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the work the European Parliament has done in this regard but we are still not con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that this will actually become re@@ al@@ ity .
I hope , therefore , that Parliament is w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate with the Council on this point .
thank you for your res@@ p@@ on@@ se and also for g@@ i@@ v@@ ing us a few more m@@ om@@ ents .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that you have been so re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c as to d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ be the c@@ u@@ ts as d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic , because that is all they can be d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed as .
however , I also re@@ al@@ ise that it is necessary to have c@@ u@@ ts in order to ensure that we have su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent resources for this g@@ en@@ er@@ ation and , indeed , future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations .
I re@@ f@@ er to your com@@ ments on rec@@ o@@ very pl@@ ans .
I would ask you to as@@ sure us that you will make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to ensure that when the rec@@ o@@ very pl@@ ans are being dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed it is not only the s@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ is@@ t@@ s but also the st@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers and the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men who will be involved in these dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
all the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men I know are re@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s and they re@@ al@@ ise that it is necessary to have c@@ l@@ o@@ sed areas to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t the b@@ re@@ ed@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds .
in sh@@ or@@ t , can you give us an as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce that you will make an e@@ f@@ for@@ t to have the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men involved in any rec@@ o@@ very pl@@ ans ?
I fully agree with the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member &apos; s view .
when we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s such important issues , it is important that all parties concerned are able to take part in the discussion in an appropriate way .
I think that it is quite ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous that this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of discussion should have a s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c basis , but all those involved , including re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men , should of course have the opportunity to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in it .
I can therefore as@@ sure you that , as far as the presidency is concerned , we will do all we can to ensure that there is a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h discussion with as many of those involved with these important issues as possible .
I should just like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office if there will be com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion available because of the c@@ u@@ ts and what effect this will have on the li@@ v@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ o@@ od@@ s of f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men ?
are there any proposals for com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion to f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men ?
the question raised by the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member is , of course , very important , particularly for the f@@ is@@ h@@ er@@ men who are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
however , I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that the question has been di@@ rec@@ ted to the w@@ r@@ on@@ g per@@ s@@ on , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
this is , as we see it , a question which should pre@@ f@@ er@@ ab@@ ly be di@@ rec@@ ted to the Commission , which is responsible for this area .
thank you very much , Mr D@@ an@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ s@@ on , for having done more than your d@@ u@@ ty in this first Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ ion T@@ im@@ e .
since the time al@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ted to Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to the Council has el@@ ap@@ sed , Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 1@@ 4 to 2@@ 2 will be an@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ red in w@@ r@@ it@@ ing .
qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons N@@ o@@ s 2@@ 3 and 2@@ 4 will not be taken since their subject is in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the agenda for the current part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to the Council .

civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 9@@ 3 / 2000 ) by Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on , on behalf of the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation a@@ m@@ en@@ ding Council R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion ( E@@ E@@ C ) No 3@@ 9@@ 2@@ 2 / 9@@ 1 on the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures in the field of civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation .
.
Mr President , I have been given a very g@@ en@@ er@@ ous e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t min@@ u@@ tes on my report here in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of this pa@@ c@@ k@@ ed C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing - I su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t that is because many people find this report quite technical and de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed .
w@@ h@@ il@@ st d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up the second li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 9 , the Council and the Commission agreed that Community a@@ i@@ r transport policy had to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of the re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y framework ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation .
su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , Council R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 3@@ 9@@ 2@@ 2 / 9@@ 1 was e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in which the technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , k@@ no@@ w@@ n as J@@ o@@ in@@ t A@@ v@@ i@@ ation R@@ e@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted by the J@@ A@@ A , were given the force of law within the Community .
it is against this b@@ ac@@ k@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d that the J@@ o@@ in@@ t A@@ v@@ i@@ ation R@@ e@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , k@@ no@@ w@@ n as J@@ A@@ R @-@ O@@ P@@ S , agreed by the J@@ A@@ A in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , are now being trans@@ p@@ o@@ sed into European Union law .
this in itself has pro@@ v@@ ed to be a difficult ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise .
but the Community has com@@ m@@ it@@ ted itself to ad@@ op@@ ting h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised safety re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for the op@@ er@@ ation of a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t .
in this regard , the J@@ A@@ R @-@ O@@ P@@ S 1 R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes a good basis from which we can work , with min@@ im@@ u@@ m ch@@ an@@ g@@ es , in order to a@@ m@@ en@@ d the appropriate re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions .
however , there are areas in which Parliament needs to ac@@ t .
firstly , in regard to c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w . op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s should have the responsibility for training , but this should be done on a h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised basis , with a d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t , uni@@ form , European @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication system which would be acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted by all Member States .
there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t in my mind that in most cases the op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s are best qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise training .
but this should not p@@ rec@@ l@@ u@@ de other qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied organisations from having the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility to do training , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing , of course , that all training is ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al C@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l A@@ v@@ i@@ ation A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ities .
in addition , the c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w directive should now be in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated into this regulation .
secondly , the difficult issue of f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time l@@ im@@ it@@ ation was not ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed by the Commission .
the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant part , k@@ no@@ w@@ n as S@@ u@@ b@@ part Q , is mis@@ sing .
this is n@@ on@@ s@@ en@@ si@@ c@@ al , because you cannot have a directive which pu@@ r@@ por@@ ts to have safety as a major part of it le@@ a@@ v@@ ing out the issue of d@@ u@@ ty time for co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it c@@ re@@ ws .
in this area , the social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers have been t@@ r@@ ying to re@@ ac@@ h an agreement for t@@ en years .
t@@ en years and no agreement must be a f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e by any m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ment you wish to adopt .
however , the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that the best people to deal with this problem are indeed the trade uni@@ ons and the a@@ ir@@ line op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s and , in a s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise , have agreed to give all si@@ d@@ es until 1 M@@ a@@ y 2001 to re@@ ac@@ h an agreement that will form the te@@ x@@ t of a new S@@ u@@ b@@ part Q .
however , should they f@@ a@@ i@@ l in their en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s then , at the second re@@ ad@@ ing stage , Parliament , through the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , will ac@@ t and le@@ g@@ is@@ late in this area .
I am h@@ op@@ e@@ ful that the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers will re@@ ac@@ h an agreement .
I am gra@@ te@@ ful to them for their current efforts .
amendments have been proposed that also look at the problem of c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
sa@@ d@@ ly , a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es at present do not st@@ r@@ ic@@ tly en@@ force c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , which has led to pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing more and more b@@ ag@@ s into a@@ ir@@ line c@@ ab@@ in@@ s .
amendment No 1@@ 6 ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses this problem , which was h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted to me by the c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w themselves and even some a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es .
I find it to@@ t@@ ally a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment .
this is a safety issue , and as their rapporteur I would ask them to s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly re@@ consider their opinion .
this amendment is to@@ t@@ ally acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to all a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es and c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w and it in no way st@@ op@@ s pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers having c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
what it does is st@@ o@@ p the ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age which has led to pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers being in@@ j@@ u@@ red from l@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ age f@@ al@@ l@@ ing out of over@@ he@@ a@@ d b@@ in@@ s ; to pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers having re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted access in case of em@@ er@@ g@@ ency e@@ va@@ c@@ u@@ ation procedures and , which I know from my own ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , to a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t to@@ il@@ et@@ s being used to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y b@@ ag@@ s .
w@@ h@@ il@@ st I ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate that M@@ E@@ P@@ s are a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the wor@@ st c@@ ul@@ pr@@ its for ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age , I would hope their s@@ en@@ se of responsibility would en@@ able them to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that a problem ex@@ is@@ t@@ s , that this problem com@@ pr@@ om@@ is@@ es safety and that A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1@@ 6 should be su@@ p@@ por@@ ted .
I believe that the report before us is wor@@ th su@@ p@@ por@@ ting .
however , in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I feel I must re@@ it@@ er@@ ate the w@@ ar@@ n@@ ing I made e@@ ar@@ li@@ er that we need an agreement on f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time l@@ im@@ it@@ ation before 1 M@@ a@@ y from our social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
if they can d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er that agreement for us , then I believe we will have a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment that we can ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly be pr@@ ou@@ d of .
I have to say that if they f@@ a@@ i@@ l in their en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s , I am sure Parliament will feel ob@@ li@@ ged to ac@@ t on their behalf .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on , we have to agree with much of what you said .
it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that it b@@ ec@@ a@@ me clear in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 9 with the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge that the European Community must not only ensure f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition but must also ensure safety in a@@ v@@ i@@ ation .
the present amendment of the regulation a@@ im@@ s to do that and I think it is right for the European institutions to clearly as@@ su@@ me their responsibility .
that means that if we are responsible for re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting a@@ v@@ i@@ ation safety in Europe , we must also take the appropriate action .
but at the same time we must also make it clear that Parliament and political bo@@ di@@ es such as the Commission and the Council should not dis@@ regard the vote of ex@@ per@@ ts .
so I very much welcome the fact that we held a very p@@ ra@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ c debate in committee and no@@ b@@ od@@ y really t@@ ri@@ ed to en@@ ter into the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of the technical rules or , so to speak , to put political k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge above the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the ex@@ per@@ ts .
you quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly also p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , and I think that is quite clear , that we need rules on d@@ u@@ ty time , and I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f am sur@@ pr@@ ised that in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of this long process the social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers have still not man@@ ag@@ ed to put rules together .
that is why I also think it is right for us as Parliament to make it clear once again that we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es and em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es &apos; re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es to f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l their ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation .
we are pre@@ pa@@ red to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce this into the regulation too , at second re@@ ad@@ ing .
on the other hand , we are e@@ qu@@ ally pre@@ pa@@ red to put our own rules in place if the social par@@ t@@ n@@ ers do not f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l their ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation . for one th@@ ing is quite clear : safety in a@@ v@@ i@@ ation must take priority .
yet safety in a@@ v@@ i@@ ation cannot be en@@ su@@ red just by having rules , especially not over@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing rules .
that is why I also say quite pla@@ in@@ ly : however much we can agree with large se@@ c@@ tions of the report , we do not consider it appropriate for Parliament to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce its own de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons into this regulation in certain areas under the he@@ ad@@ ing , for in@@ st@@ ance , of &quot; one c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w m@@ em@@ b@@ er op@@ er@@ ations &quot; or l@@ en@@ g@@ th of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , i@@ .@@ e@@ . how long s@@ om@@ e@@ one has already s@@ er@@ v@@ ed as a c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w m@@ em@@ b@@ er .
so unfortunately we will not be able to vote for your A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 9 and 1@@ 0 , which concern such proposals .
I was s@@ om@@ e@@ what sur@@ pr@@ ised to see how in@@ t@@ ently the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m con@@ si@@ de@@ red and dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed the question of hand b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
in my view that is not an issue for a par@@ li@@ a@@ ment to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s and I can only say to Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on and my other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es : let the a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es re@@ gu@@ late that ; it is not the j@@ o@@ b of Members .
Mr President , Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on , Commissioner , I h@@ op@@ ed for a moment , just after se@@ e@@ ing the n@@ e@@ ws - and in fact things were l@@ o@@ o@@ king a b@@ it that way - that we would start with a debate on f@@ o@@ x h@@ un@@ ting , which will d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less pro@@ ve to be an extremely li@@ v@@ el@@ y debate in B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in &apos; s House of C@@ om@@ m@@ ons this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
we are also going to be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous matters here .
we h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted one particular as@@ p@@ ec@@ t rec@@ ently at any ra@@ te , that of the f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time of p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s , and we also put qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to the Commissioner on the subject at an e@@ ar@@ li@@ er stage .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that a situation has ar@@ is@@ en in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time in which the par@@ t@@ n@@ ers have had it p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out to them once again that they still have the ch@@ ance to en@@ ter into con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion or re@@ ac@@ h ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents .
if they do not do so then , as others have already said , this will a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally mean as@@ king the Commission to draw up legislation in this area which will at least pre@@ v@@ ent accidents from o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing as a result of p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s s@@ pen@@ ding too long at the con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s .
re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch from which we once ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed an@@ s@@ w@@ ers now ta@@ k@@ es too long , and these n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations could s@@ p@@ e@@ ed this up , and perhaps in time we will g@@ a@@ in an even better under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of what all the important f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s might be .
one as@@ p@@ ec@@ t that we did not ra@@ ise during the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons , because it only c@@ a@@ me into pla@@ y la@@ ter on , is the one that we have also tabled an amendment on , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that of long ha@@ u@@ l f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts .
it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly ap@@ par@@ ent - and c@@ la@@ im@@ s to this effect are now being made not only in A@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ a , but also in E@@ n@@ g@@ land , concerning B@@ r@@ it@@ ish A@@ ir@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s - that long ha@@ u@@ l f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts can cause people to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p th@@ r@@ om@@ bo@@ ses .
we cannot yet be com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly certain of this , n@@ or do we have all the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant f@@ ac@@ ts in our p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ sion yet , but we rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness of the situation all the same , and w@@ on@@ d@@ er if it would not be s@@ en@@ si@@ ble to request the Commission - v@@ i@@ a an amendment in this case , o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise we will do so using other means - to come up with some initiatives on this f@@ r@@ on@@ t .
finally , and this is something we have given no th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to , there is the fact that some a@@ v@@ i@@ ation com@@ p@@ an@@ ies with large a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t are st@@ ar@@ ting to f@@ ly at a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de , which also pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om@@ s of il@@ l@@ ness .
we will re@@ v@@ is@@ it this issue at a la@@ ter stage .
Mr President , Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on &apos;s report is t@@ r@@ u@@ ly excellent , and I am qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied to say so for I consider m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f to be one of the few people who are f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with the technical as well as the political si@@ d@@ e of the sector , having rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed al@@ most 1@@ 0 000 f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t h@@ ou@@ r@@ s p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of a f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t c@@ re@@ w before de@@ v@@ o@@ ting m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f to p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s .
safety can be con@@ si@@ de@@ red to be based on two el@@ em@@ ents : the technical el@@ ement , such as the resources , a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t , a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts , ra@@ di@@ o aid , a@@ i@@ r tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic control and so on and so for@@ th , and then the human el@@ ement , which is extremely important and , although not the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al cause , has been f@@ ou@@ n@@ d to be a con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting f@@ ac@@ to@@ r in an extremely high per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t accidents . the human el@@ ement is , of course , extremely com@@ p@@ le@@ x and , for si@@ m@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity &apos;s sa@@ k@@ e , can be di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed into two main c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies .
one of these is training , and in this area all the appropriate con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s and ch@@ ec@@ ks must be carried out . I can say from my own ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence that f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t c@@ re@@ ws are pro@@ per@@ ly tra@@ in@@ ed for , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , there are no su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s .
as a general r@@ u@@ le , su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s do not f@@ ly : they are all re@@ st@@ ing in peace under@@ g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d . the other c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y is wor@@ k@@ l@@ o@@ a@@ d .
the problems here are en@@ or@@ m@@ ous : on the one hand , there is the need to make both a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t and st@@ a@@ f@@ f f@@ ly as much as possible , and on the other , there is the need to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d pu@@ sh@@ ing human be@@ in@@ g@@ s , especially , be@@ y@@ on@@ d their p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al and m@@ en@@ ta@@ l l@@ im@@ its .
s@@ le@@ e@@ p , the dis@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion of c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ a@@ di@@ an r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m@@ s and so on clearly in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t safety as well as the per@@ s@@ on@@ al health of the members of the f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ ws .
here , then , is the g@@ a@@ p in the regulation , for it con@@ si@@ d@@ ers pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y the technical as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the resources - a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t l@@ o@@ a@@ d f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s , l@@ o@@ ad@@ ing op@@ er@@ ations , l@@ en@@ g@@ th of r@@ un@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s , s@@ c@@ re@@ en he@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ts et@@ c@@ . but it is e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y la@@ c@@ king in any pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on the wor@@ k@@ l@@ o@@ ad@@ s of the st@@ a@@ f@@ f .
I am not t@@ al@@ king as a trade uni@@ on@@ is@@ t here but p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y as a u@@ se@@ r of a@@ i@@ r transport who would de@@ ar@@ ly like to have a guarantee - although I re@@ g@@ re@@ t that a 1@@ 00 % guarantee is im@@ possible - which is as high as possible and a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ s ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation of the human el@@ ement which is li@@ able to have serious or even f@@ a@@ ta@@ l consequences .
another f@@ ac@@ to@@ r to be taken into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation is com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
if there are no st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d rules , some of the a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es who ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it their st@@ a@@ f@@ f will be able to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce their costs and therefore o@@ f@@ f@@ er more com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve pr@@ ic@@ es , d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ting what ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition in a sector which is now al@@ most com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ed .
however , we could even go so far as to t@@ al@@ k of un@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r or ir@@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition if this f@@ ac@@ to@@ r were not taken into account , and I w@@ on@@ d@@ er at the fact that n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the Union as a whole n@@ or Parliament , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally , has su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting the matter sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ il@@ y .
Parliament should feel t@@ r@@ u@@ ly as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed at not having man@@ ag@@ ed to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s a clear opinion or pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce an effective defin@@ ition of all aspects of the issue .
Mr President , V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , I consider this regulation extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in a@@ v@@ i@@ ation safety since 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 7 .
that means we must also re@@ gu@@ late the f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and re@@ st ti@@ m@@ es of the co@@ c@@ k@@ p@@ it c@@ re@@ w as of the c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w .
I agree with the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers that we should give the uni@@ ons and the a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es a last ch@@ ance to se@@ t@@ t@@ le this issue between themselves , working j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly and p@@ ra@@ g@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally .
of course we have agreed that they must re@@ ac@@ h an agreement by M@@ a@@ y next year .
Madam V@@ ice @-@ President , p@@ le@@ a@@ se te@@ l@@ l your services that if they have not done so by the end of M@@ a@@ y we will no longer pla@@ y the g@@ a@@ me that has been pla@@ y@@ ed for si@@ x years , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y with the Commission w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for the parties to re@@ ac@@ h agreement .
but they have not re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed agreement .
the Commission be@@ ha@@ v@@ ed very p@@ ol@@ it@@ el@@ y and did not make any proposals of its own .
either the parties agree by M@@ a@@ y , or we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the Commission to put forward a proposal that we can in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate in the second re@@ ad@@ ing . for it is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble not to re@@ gu@@ late a question that is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ er safety , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y whether the c@@ ap@@ ta@@ in@@ s , the c@@ re@@ ws , have had enough re@@ st to be able to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out their d@@ u@@ ti@@ es .
these issues must be se@@ t@@ t@@ led .
let me ad@@ d@@ res@@ s a second point that c@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t my attention at the December Council meeting .
if we adopt a position at first re@@ ad@@ ing , in fact at Parliament &apos;s fin@@ al vote t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , then I in@@ s@@ is@@ t as I am sure my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es will also do on the Council dec@@ i@@ d@@ ing a common position .
it can w@@ a@@ it ti@@ l@@ l M@@ a@@ y , ti@@ l@@ l the two parties have re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed agreement .
but in the interests of pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ er safety in Europe we cannot accept no decisions being taken on a@@ v@@ i@@ ation until the su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed se@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ ement of the G@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ al@@ ta@@ r conflict .
the Commission and Parliament should j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly see to that .
Mr President , as mentioned in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 9 , the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of the re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y framework ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation in order to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in a high level of safety and to ensure f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition in the internal market .
h@@ ence , the Community adopted Council R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion 3@@ 9@@ 2@@ 2 / 9@@ 1 .
this regulation l@@ is@@ ted a number of technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments - J@@ A@@ R@@ s - pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by the J@@ o@@ in@@ t A@@ v@@ i@@ ation A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
it was not the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of this regulation to r@@ e @-@ open a debate on the su@@ b@@ st@@ ance of J@@ A@@ R : the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e was to ensure h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation .
in addition , it should be rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised that J@@ A@@ R @-@ O@@ P@@ S has been im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted on a national basis and is ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to European countries ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the EU .
therefore ch@@ an@@ g@@ es must be k@@ e@@ p@@ t to a min@@ im@@ u@@ m as there cannot be two different se@@ ts of op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions in force ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s Europe .
the Commission &apos;s or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al proposal h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted f@@ our areas which were f@@ ou@@ n@@ d to be in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble in EU law : ex@@ em@@ p@@ tions , le@@ as@@ ing , re@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion and c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w training .
unfortunately , the debate so far has c@@ ent@@ red on c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age and f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time l@@ im@@ it@@ ations for f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t c@@ re@@ w .
on the first point - c@@ ab@@ in b@@ ag@@ g@@ age - the amendments are an@@ t@@ i @-@ com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve and cannot apply to third @-@ country c@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers .
su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent regulation is already in place , which does not allow on bo@@ ar@@ d hand b@@ ag@@ g@@ age which cannot be sa@@ f@@ el@@ y st@@ o@@ w@@ ed - I can v@@ ou@@ ch for that as a c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w m@@ em@@ b@@ er for 2@@ 6 years .
on my second point - f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time l@@ im@@ it@@ ations , which are already h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly re@@ gu@@ la@@ ted and agreed through national governments - civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation is now in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in working time regulation .
ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of the decision taken on 1 M@@ a@@ y , this issue would have to be re@@ f@@ er@@ red back to national governments for further discussion .
it is not for Parliament to le@@ g@@ is@@ late on f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t time l@@ im@@ it@@ ations .
finally , I believe that in future safety and h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly technical reports such as this should be subject to a si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fied procedure in order to process necessary ch@@ an@@ g@@ es more s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ il@@ y .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are some things that are not quite as we would wish them to be in European a@@ v@@ i@@ ation .
last year , in particular , s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ed us re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly that it is high time to find more common European s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to ensure that f@@ l@@ ying in European a@@ ir@@ s@@ pa@@ ce f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws or@@ d@@ er@@ ly l@@ in@@ es again , not to speak of the great d@@ re@@ am of l@@ im@@ it@@ less freedom above the c@@ l@@ ou@@ ds con@@ j@@ u@@ red up by R@@ e@@ in@@ h@@ ar@@ d M@@ e@@ y .
but first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most , f@@ l@@ ying must be sa@@ f@@ e .
we all want f@@ l@@ ying to re@@ main sa@@ f@@ e , to see further im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents here in the f@@ o@@ re@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t the rapporteur , Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on , to w@@ h@@ o@@ m we o@@ we th@@ an@@ ks for an excellent report .
there are , however , different v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on how to achieve greater safety .
I and l@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ il@@ y I am not al@@ one in my view would hope that we le@@ a@@ ve the p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al ta@@ s@@ k of re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting the safety pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons , especially in regard to c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w and the ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ ying pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on c@@ re@@ w training , to the European A@@ v@@ i@@ ation S@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ y A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
su@@ re@@ ly it should be enough for the European le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ to@@ r to set out the objectives , rather than g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing bo@@ g@@ g@@ ed down in too much de@@ ta@@ i@@ l .
unfortunately , this position did not g@@ a@@ in con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity support in committee .
as a result the te@@ x@@ t we will be v@@ o@@ ting on t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es some rather too de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons , for in@@ st@@ ance on the kind of training course re@@ qu@@ i@@ red and so for@@ th .
perhaps less would be more in this case .
be that as it may , Europe still has a great deal to do on the question of a@@ v@@ i@@ ation .
as we sa@@ w in Nice on a very general basis , here too on a more specific basis we could p@@ le@@ a@@ d for fe@@ w@@ er national s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions and a more European approach .
the S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on report is a good st@@ e@@ p al@@ on@@ g this road .
let us take that st@@ e@@ p t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w and then pu@@ r@@ su@@ e it further in a p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
Mr President , V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , in the past , Parliament has con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted its commitment to the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of safety st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est possible level for the Union .
now it must continue to do so , and to ensure , as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ency , that this is clearly v@@ is@@ i@@ ble to the European citizens , who every year continue to su@@ f@@ f@@ er the problems of the European area .
we all agree that the objective is to su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully do a@@ way with national dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es in order to ar@@ ri@@ ve at a set of common safety st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est possible level .
a@@ i@@ r safety cannot be con@@ fin@@ ed to European Union ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y , and it is important for European citizens who tra@@ v@@ e@@ l or li@@ ve n@@ e@@ a@@ r a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts to be con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent that a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t from third countries f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l all the necessary safety c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a .
the Union must therefore have control m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s to ensure that , in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with international re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , third country a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ing at our a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts com@@ p@@ ly with international safety re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions .
this means common control m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s and technical and ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive organisation and support .
it is therefore in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able that safety in this sector should become a matter for international cooperation within the framework of the different in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments for technical assistance and support for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in third countries .
Mr President , I will end by p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out the need to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the Commission in its work in this very com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated field and the priority which must be given to c@@ re@@ ating the European A@@ i@@ r S@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ y A@@ g@@ ency , as well as the need for in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , which we are currently con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing , on issues re@@ la@@ ting to re@@ st per@@ i@@ od@@ s for a@@ ir@@ c@@ re@@ w .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on for his ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ent work as rapporteur on this proposal .
I believe that his work has con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to this Parliament &apos; s under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of a very technical and com@@ p@@ le@@ x proposal and it is of course no e@@ as@@ y ta@@ s@@ k to trans@@ late it into a l@@ an@@ gu@@ age which is acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ble to the a@@ ver@@ age c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en .
in this respect I believe that he has been very su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful .
having said that , the amendment we are pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing to the R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion currently in force has t@@ w@@ in objectives : firstly , it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to mo@@ ve forward with the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of the re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y system in the field of safety in civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation by ex@@ t@@ en@@ ding it to the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of the op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t ; secondly , it in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to establish procedures which will allow the Community to man@@ age the v@@ ar@@ i@@ ab@@ l@@ es and ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions which the Member States are ob@@ li@@ ged to adopt from time to time as a result of op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al needs .
with regard to technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , the report ma@@ in@@ ly de@@ als with two aspects .
in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with J@@ A@@ A re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , which la@@ y down the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , the Commission &apos; s proposal does not con@@ ta@@ in any pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons on f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and d@@ u@@ ty ti@@ m@@ es or on re@@ st per@@ i@@ od@@ s .
this is a very con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al issue and the re@@ al@@ ity is that no agreement has been re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed in this regard within the J@@ A@@ A .
of course , the Commission h@@ op@@ es that the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ at@@ or@@ s re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing the op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s and the c@@ re@@ ws will be su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful , and Mr S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ on has ur@@ g@@ ed them to re@@ ac@@ h a v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y agreement on safety systems re@@ la@@ ting to f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and d@@ u@@ ty ti@@ m@@ es and re@@ st per@@ i@@ od@@ s .
if they are not c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents by M@@ a@@ y , we will then have to consider whether or not we should ac@@ t .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , of the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant amendments , the Commission acc@@ e@@ p@@ ts the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 1@@ 2 , 1@@ 3 and 1@@ 7 , but with a different wor@@ ding .
with regard to A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 , the Commission s@@ ha@@ res Parliament &apos; s de@@ si@@ r@@ e to re@@ gu@@ late the safety of f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and d@@ u@@ ty ti@@ m@@ es and re@@ st per@@ i@@ od@@ s , but pre@@ f@@ ers that com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with this objective not only be pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by means of the specific proposal that we are de@@ b@@ ating today .
there are other p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , such as a@@ m@@ en@@ ding the R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion after the ad@@ op@@ tion of the present proposal .
I would like to ad@@ d that any proposal p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by the Commission in the future will have to guarantee the high level of safety that we all wish to see .
therefore , if the Commission makes use of the v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y agreement between the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ at@@ or@@ s , to which I have just re@@ f@@ er@@ red , to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a proposal , it would a@@ m@@ en@@ d the agreement where necessary in order to achieve the necessary high level of safety .
with this res@@ er@@ va@@ tion , I re@@ p@@ e@@ at , the Commission acc@@ e@@ p@@ ts the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 .
various amendments have also been adopted on the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ ws .
while this proposal de@@ als with the op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ ws , the training and prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al qu@@ al@@ i@@ fication re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments are the subject of a se@@ par@@ ate and su@@ p@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y Commission proposal .
we must take c@@ are to ensure that the two te@@ x@@ ts are in agreement and com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with one another .
amendments N@@ o@@ s 9 and 1@@ 0 can be acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted without ch@@ an@@ g@@ es , but the wor@@ ding of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 6 , 7 , 8 and 1@@ 1 will have to be mo@@ di@@ fied , as well as A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 1@@ 2 , 1@@ 3 and 1@@ 7 , which we now accept only in principle , and their wor@@ ding will also have to be mo@@ di@@ fied .
finally , the amendments on technical re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 4 , 5 and 1@@ 6 , are acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble , although the fin@@ al te@@ x@@ t of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 4 will re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t the s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to the problem in question as f@@ ou@@ n@@ d by the Council .
in relation to the procedures for the ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l of te@@ m@@ por@@ ary v@@ ar@@ i@@ ab@@ l@@ es and ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions , the Commission does not accept A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 2 , 1@@ 4 and 1@@ 5 .
the Commission is already under in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out the con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tions la@@ i@@ d down in the amendments .
l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise , A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 3 must be re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted , since d@@ er@@ o@@ g@@ ation of the R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion is en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ ed once the European A@@ i@@ r S@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ y A@@ g@@ ency has been c@@ re@@ ated .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , with regard to A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1@@ 8 , the two issues it ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses are concerned more with the health of pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers than the op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al safety of f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts .
as was mentioned in the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the protection of a@@ i@@ r pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers , the Commission in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to establish groups of ex@@ per@@ ts to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine the r@@ is@@ ks to pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers &apos; health , including those re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ i@@ c ra@@ di@@ ation , with the a@@ i@@ m of de@@ ter@@ min@@ ing what these r@@ is@@ ks are and pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing the necessary measures .
with regard to the specific issue of ar@@ te@@ ri@@ al th@@ r@@ om@@ bo@@ si@@ s - which has been raised by some of you - the Commission has w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en to the a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es to request that they provide pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers with information on the r@@ is@@ ks , on f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s for pre@@ dis@@ position and on what they can do to min@@ im@@ ise those r@@ is@@ ks , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in relation to the problem of th@@ r@@ om@@ bo@@ si@@ s and in relation to health problems in general .
the Commission con@@ si@@ d@@ ers that such information would be a very v@@ al@@ i@@ d p@@ rec@@ a@@ u@@ tion and that it would be appropriate in terms of im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers &apos; rights .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
priorities in road safety
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 1 / 2000 ) by Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en , on behalf of the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , on the proposal for a European Parliament resolution on the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Committee and the Committee of the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ons : priorities in EU R@@ o@@ a@@ d S@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ y - P@@ ro@@ g@@ res@@ s R@@ e@@ por@@ t and R@@ an@@ king of A@@ c@@ tions .
, rapporteur .
( S@@ V ) Mr President , I would like to start by th@@ an@@ king all my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members in Parliament and in the Committee for the support they have given me in my work on this report .
safety on our roads is something which concerns us all , whether we ourselves are road @-@ u@@ s@@ ers or whether s@@ om@@ e@@ one in our family or a f@@ ri@@ end has been k@@ il@@ led or in@@ j@@ u@@ red .
trans@@ por@@ ta@@ tion by road is the most common and the f@@ a@@ st@@ est g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing means of tra@@ v@@ el@@ ling and of trans@@ por@@ ting ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es and g@@ o@@ od@@ s , but also the most d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous .
each year , over 4@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 people are k@@ il@@ led on our European roads .
this means more than 8@@ 00 people a w@@ e@@ e@@ k and over 1@@ 1@@ 5 people this very day .
road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents are the most common cause of death of children and young per@@ s@@ ons - indeed , of all per@@ s@@ ons under the age of 4@@ 5 - in the EU today .
m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of people are also s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly in@@ j@@ u@@ red each year , and many will end up h@@ an@@ d@@ ic@@ ap@@ p@@ ed for life .
this is a matter of great human su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing and of he@@ a@@ v@@ y social costs .
we would n@@ e@@ v@@ er t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate such m@@ or@@ t@@ al@@ ity fi@@ gu@@ res in a@@ v@@ i@@ ation or on the ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s , where our approach to safety is to@@ t@@ ally different .
so , if we are to min@@ im@@ ise the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities on the roads , we must adopt the same p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y with regard to roads , since this also in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es a com@@ pl@@ ic@@ ated m@@ an @-@ ma@@ ch@@ ine system which must in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of human er@@ ro@@ r .
the objective in the long @-@ term should be that no @-@ one should be k@@ il@@ led or s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly in@@ j@@ u@@ red .
to at@@ ta@@ in this objective , we must take a com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve view in which the ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te responsibility li@@ es with those who de@@ si@@ g@@ n the roads and the sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding infrastructure .
it is the responsibility of road @-@ u@@ s@@ ers to follow the rules and la@@ ws which have been la@@ i@@ d down .
the Commission &apos; s com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation con@@ ta@@ in@@ s a l@@ is@@ t of priorities for measures for the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing per@@ i@@ o@@ d of the P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me .
I agree with the Commission concerning the si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of se@@ ver@@ al of these measures such as the aid to E@@ u@@ ro@@ N@@ C@@ A@@ P , information c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s , legislation on s@@ p@@ e@@ ed g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ or@@ s for li@@ g@@ h@@ t t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ks , and - especially - legislation on sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts .
in my report , I w@@ ent on to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te on the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing per@@ i@@ o@@ d of the P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me , which would have to co@@ v@@ er a longer per@@ i@@ o@@ d - let us say , the per@@ i@@ o@@ d 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 0 - to en@@ able a more long @-@ term strategy to be adopted .
but if the Commission is really serious about its a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities , we will first of all have to give h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er priority to the whole question of road safety , because this matter re@@ qu@@ i@@ res p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful measures
first of all , a c@@ re@@ di@@ ble strategy for com@@ b@@ ating death on the roads must , over the next dec@@ ad@@ e , in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de con@@ c@@ re@@ te n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ical ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s for re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities .
the Committee pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses those ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s which were already e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed by Parliament three years ago .
but objectives at EU level are not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently con@@ c@@ re@@ te for the Member States where , as we all know , a large part of the work is done .
each Member State must therefore de@@ v@@ ise its own ro@@ ad@@ safety programmes ( which not all Member States have at present ) , including st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es for at@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the national ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s .
these can of course di@@ f@@ f@@ er between the various countries , de@@ pen@@ ding on tra@@ d@@ ition and c@@ ul@@ ture .
however , after that , the Commission should follow up how the Member States com@@ p@@ ly with their st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es and should take part in the ex@@ change of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences and best practice .
we also need European legislation in certain important areas .
al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l k@@ il@@ l@@ s ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 9 000 people on the roads each year .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the t@@ r@@ end in@@ d@@ ic@@ a@@ tes that more and more young people are d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing with al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l in their b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d .
an e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted 1 000 li@@ v@@ es could be sa@@ v@@ ed by in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a directive with a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 5 m@@ g / m@@ l .
unfortunately , the Commission has w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n its for@@ m@@ er proposal for a directive - one which was su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by Parliament in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 and which the Committee su@@ p@@ por@@ ts even now .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the Commission , d@@ r@@ in@@ k @-@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing is a question that f@@ al@@ l@@ s under the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity .
but how can that be ?
su@@ re@@ ly it cannot be any less d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous to d@@ ri@@ ve with al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l in the b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d in G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , I@@ t@@ al@@ y , I@@ re@@ land and L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , where an 0@@ .@@ 8 m@@ g / m@@ l l@@ im@@ it ap@@ p@@ li@@ es , than it is in the re@@ st of Europe .
we have p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in the EU when it comes to issues concerning road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic safety .
in my opinion , we should use these p@@ o@@ w@@ ers p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y in those areas where they have a real effect , and they do have a real effect where al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l and d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing are concerned .
I ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the Council and the Swedish Presidency to take the initiative in this matter .
I cannot understand how we can p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly g@@ a@@ in c@@ re@@ di@@ bility as European p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans if we , on the one hand , say that tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic safety is important but , on the other hand , are not pre@@ pa@@ red to take important decisions .
I understand that the Commission has today is@@ su@@ ed a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for a l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 5 m@@ g / m@@ l , but I must say that it is re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ ble that it should be is@@ su@@ ed today , just when Parliament is about to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the issue and before Parliament has voted .
the Commission should have w@@ a@@ ited for Parliament to have held its discussion .
in addition to this matter , and the matter of sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts , the report con@@ ta@@ in@@ s a number of other important proposals for tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic safety measures .
I ra@@ ise issues such as di@@ p@@ p@@ ed he@@ ad@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts in the d@@ a@@ y@@ time , d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing education and te@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c systems .
to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de , one question which I consider to be of the u@@ t@@ most importance but which , unfortunately , was not pa@@ s@@ sed by the Committee is that of the need for better working conditions for prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s .
the European Parliament has always been a force for the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed road safety , and we have to continue in this di@@ rec@@ tion .
it is a matter of the life and health of n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous people - but , above all , those of the young citizens of Europe .
Mr President , 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 f@@ at@@ al@@ ities on Europe &apos; s roads is 4@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 too many .
this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er re@@ ac@@ ts with s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity to all the e@@ v@@ ents taking place ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the world , but we do not give su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent attention to the G@@ ri@@ m R@@ e@@ ap@@ er at work on the roads of Europe .
without in any way under@@ ra@@ ting the si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance of ma@@ d co@@ w dis@@ e@@ a@@ se I am n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s as@@ king for a s@@ en@@ se of pro@@ por@@ tion .
th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds more of our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w c@@ re@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res di@@ e in tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents than from B@@ S@@ E .
this should be a cause for p@@ an@@ ic .
I would like to thank the Commission for its ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the situation .
EU cooperation is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed more than ever , as there are d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in the levels of road safety within our Community .
f@@ our ti@@ m@@ es as many people di@@ e in road accidents in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al than in B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in .
however , there is pl@@ ent@@ y more sc@@ op@@ e for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in every country .
the tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic environment must be made to become as sa@@ f@@ e as possible , but d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s are always responsible for their own safety and that of others on the road .
a c@@ a@@ r in a g@@ ar@@ age is com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly h@@ ar@@ m@@ less , but when it is being used w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly it is like a de@@ ad@@ ly w@@ e@@ ap@@ on .
tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions are not co@@ o@@ k@@ er@@ y bo@@ o@@ k re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ es that everyone can ad@@ ap@@ t to their own ta@@ st@@ e .
the time for in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al@@ ity on our roads is past : we need just as st@@ r@@ ic@@ t com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions on the roads as we do with a@@ i@@ r tra@@ v@@ e@@ l .
I will m@@ en@@ tion three important w@@ a@@ y@@ s of re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the number of road f@@ at@@ al@@ ities .
firstly , there is com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with s@@ p@@ e@@ ed re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions . I often d@@ ri@@ ve in the Mediterranean countries , and , believe it or not , c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to within the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion , and I am con@@ st@@ an@@ tly being over@@ taken .
and it is no w@@ on@@ d@@ er , because only very ra@@ re@@ ly do I see any s@@ p@@ e@@ ed con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s in op@@ er@@ ation .
the acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s for these areas speak pla@@ in@@ ly .
this la@@ x@@ ness is pa@@ i@@ d for in human life and the te@@ ar@@ s of those le@@ f@@ t be@@ h@@ in@@ d .
ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d two out of every three d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s in Europe go over the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ it in b@@ u@@ il@@ t @-@ up areas and h@@ al@@ f b@@ re@@ a@@ k the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ it on the open road .
if ma@@ d co@@ ws should be re@@ mo@@ v@@ ed from pa@@ st@@ ur@@ e land , ma@@ d s@@ p@@ e@@ ed m@@ er@@ ch@@ an@@ ts should be re@@ mo@@ v@@ ed from the roads .
an effective , if not very p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r , re@@ m@@ ed@@ y is a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c s@@ p@@ e@@ ed con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s and he@@ a@@ v@@ y pen@@ al@@ ti@@ es .
certainly in my country , F@@ in@@ land , the EUR 1@@ 00 000 fin@@ es pa@@ i@@ d by some a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to just r@@ ou@@ t@@ ine f@@ are c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tions .
secondly , in v@@ in@@ o ver@@ it@@ as : there is t@@ r@@ u@@ th in w@@ ine .
it is also t@@ r@@ u@@ e that al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l pla@@ y@@ s a part in no less than 9 000 cases of death a year .
I think it is important that Member States s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to an al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 5 per m@@ i@@ l , which can also be m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d .
if Member States lack the c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge to do this , the matter must be de@@ al@@ t with through decision @-@ making at European level .
people s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es have to be pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted from their own governments .
in re@@ p@@ e@@ ated cases of d@@ r@@ un@@ k@@ en d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing , or when the d@@ ri@@ v@@ er is well over the l@@ im@@ it , there should be a long b@@ an and the c@@ a@@ r should be con@@ f@@ is@@ c@@ ated by the state .
the third point has to do with ta@@ x@@ ation .
high ta@@ x@@ es on c@@ ar@@ s le@@ a@@ d to ol@@ d and un@@ sa@@ f@@ e c@@ ar@@ s on the road .
my country is a sa@@ d example of this .
F@@ in@@ land is the C@@ u@@ b@@ a of Europe when it comes to the age of c@@ ar@@ s .
c@@ ar@@ s that f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent safety st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds should also b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from l@@ o@@ w@@ er ta@@ x@@ ation .
in general , ta@@ x@@ ation should f@@ o@@ c@@ us on a c@@ a@@ r &apos; s use and not its pu@@ r@@ c@@ ha@@ se pr@@ ice .
ladies and gentlemen , I wish you a sa@@ f@@ e t@@ ri@@ p .
re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er to f@@ a@@ st@@ en your safety b@@ el@@ t in the back too .
Mr President , first of all I thank the rapporteur for her s@@ pl@@ en@@ did work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr V@@ at@@ an@@ en for his contribution , s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group .
I fully en@@ d@@ or@@ se many of the points he made , not least in respect of b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d @-@ al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ its .
in fact there are only two points that I wish to make this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
they re@@ la@@ te to sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts and the very important issue of b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
on sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts , I think it is wor@@ th p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive .
in fact this Commissioner p@@ le@@ d@@ ged to this House in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary last year , a year ago , that we would have a directive on sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts .
a year on there is no directive .
what we have in F@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ u@@ ary is a he@@ ar@@ ing .
more t@@ al@@ k .
no action .
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , two th@@ ou@@ s@@ and people in the last year have n@@ e@@ ed@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly , un@@ n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y l@@ o@@ s@@ t their li@@ v@@ es because the Commission would rather t@@ al@@ k than ac@@ t .
I hope t@@ on@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w the Commission l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ s to the vote of this House and dec@@ i@@ d@@ es to pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed with its commitment to have a directive on sa@@ f@@ er c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts . no more t@@ al@@ k , p@@ le@@ a@@ se .
let us see some action .
and , indeed , the same is t@@ r@@ u@@ e for b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
we have had t@@ al@@ k on this issue , year in , year out .
we all know that t@@ en th@@ ou@@ s@@ and people a year in Europe are k@@ il@@ led in d@@ r@@ in@@ k @-@ re@@ la@@ ted c@@ ra@@ sh@@ es .
we must ta@@ c@@ k@@ le that particular problem .
but I find it h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly ir@@ on@@ ic , and I am sure the ti@@ m@@ ing is not co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ en@@ ta@@ l , that on the very day that we are de@@ b@@ ating b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l , d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing , road safety , the day before this Parliament is to vote on d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing , the Commissioner has already made her mind up .
she has is@@ su@@ ed a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
it would have been n@@ ice , would it not , for the Commissioner to have at least l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ed to the debate , le@@ ar@@ n@@ ed what the ou@@ t@@ come of the vote was t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , before she dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to pr@@ e @-@ em@@ p@@ t the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y procedures and issue this re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation .
we know a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation , al@@ as , is simply not wor@@ th the pa@@ per it is w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en on .
Member States need and support clear gu@@ i@@ d@@ ance .
we believe it is time for the Commissioner to get t@@ ou@@ g@@ h on d@@ r@@ un@@ k d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s and d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing , to come forward with a directive to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the l@@ im@@ it to 5@@ 0 m@@ g .
in the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m , which has tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally had a good rec@@ or@@ d , we have sa@@ d@@ ly seen over the C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s per@@ i@@ o@@ d a r@@ ise in the n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of people d@@ r@@ in@@ king and d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
in my own region , in some par@@ ts of my region , 1@@ 7 % of d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s te@@ st@@ ed were above the U@@ K legal l@@ im@@ it of 8@@ 0 m@@ g .
it is quite clear that we need action .
indeed the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish government is as@@ king for a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion at European level , in a European context .
so all I make is a very si@@ m@@ p@@ le request to the Commissioner t@@ on@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t to l@@ is@@ t@@ en to the debate and to he@@ ed the vote t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding report on a subject which t@@ ou@@ ch@@ es the d@@ a@@ il@@ y li@@ v@@ es of every c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er he or she ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s to be in Europe , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y our own safety on the roads and that of our children .
I would like to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s three particular points .
firstly , I would ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ate d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up European legislation with regard to a European p@@ ed@@ e@@ st@@ ri@@ an te@@ st and the f@@ our as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated c@@ ra@@ s@@ h te@@ st@@ s .
after 2@@ 2 years of EU su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , it is clear be@@ y@@ on@@ d all d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that these te@@ st@@ s are of v@@ al@@ u@@ e and that h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of li@@ v@@ es can be s@@ pa@@ red every year as a result .
this is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly par@@ a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t for many p@@ ed@@ e@@ st@@ ri@@ ans and c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s , particularly in a d@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted country such as the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , but also el@@ se@@ where of course .
of course it is very n@@ ice of Commissioner L@@ i@@ i@@ k@@ an@@ en to allow the c@@ a@@ r industry more time to make their own ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , the bo@@ t@@ t@@ o@@ m @-@ up approach , again g@@ i@@ v@@ ing them time until J@@ un@@ e , but now in 2001 , but it is all taking too long for my l@@ i@@ k@@ ing .
man@@ ag@@ ing also means making c@@ h@@ o@@ ic@@ es , and the time is ri@@ p@@ e for this .
a second point I would like to ra@@ ise re@@ la@@ tes to al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ its in the b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d .
some members of my group will support the rapporteur &apos; s proposal to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce an EU regulation se@@ t@@ t@@ ing an al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 5 per c@@ ent .
we do not wish to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d this l@@ im@@ it but we do think that h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of this l@@ im@@ it will en@@ h@@ an@@ ce people &apos; s legal c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y in a Union where many citizens c@@ ro@@ s@@ s the internal b@@ or@@ d@@ ers d@@ a@@ il@@ y , and where the mo@@ bility of em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y what we want to promote .
I am not in favour of se@@ t@@ t@@ ing l@@ o@@ w@@ er l@@ im@@ its for certain c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies of young road @-@ u@@ s@@ ers though .
the si@@ g@@ n@@ al we s@@ en@@ d out must be clear .
either a st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d is sa@@ f@@ e or it is not .
and 0@@ .@@ 5 % is a s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ally responsible , e@@ a@@ si@@ ly m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ ra@@ ble and en@@ for@@ c@@ e@@ able qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity to my mind .
now , Commissioner , I would just like to un@@ b@@ ur@@ d@@ en m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f of the fact that I think it is extremely dis@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ ous towards Parliament that the Commissioner e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently already dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed , in ad@@ v@@ ance of this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing &apos; s debate - in which , when all is said and done , people are c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for a regulation on the al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it - that a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to the Member States will su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e .
this will encourage a non @-@ com@@ m@@ it@@ ta@@ l att@@ it@@ u@@ de and will certainly do nothing to increase transparency from the citizens &apos; per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
my fin@@ al point re@@ la@@ tes to the long @-@ term &apos; V@@ is@@ i@@ on Z@@ er@@ o &apos; objective .
I have a problem with this .
an objective must be re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c and ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ va@@ ble , that is what mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tes and st@@ im@@ u@@ la@@ tes .
n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally we can re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s , but it would be w@@ is@@ h@@ ful th@@ in@@ king to believe we could el@@ im@@ in@@ ate road accidents al@@ together .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my th@@ an@@ ks for the ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ent work done by Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en .
there are many reasons for the accidents and the extremely high number of v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s on European roads .
the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses are many and v@@ ar@@ i@@ ed , and the report has been able to m@@ en@@ tion and su@@ m@@ mar@@ ise the most important on@@ es .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on priorities in road safety con@@ ta@@ in@@ s si@@ x points de@@ ta@@ il@@ ing the aspects on which we can have the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st impact in order to achieve better results .
I am going to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on the aspects which re@@ f@@ er to the management of the b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s on the roads and the re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the effects of im@@ pa@@ c@@ ts on road in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
a high number of acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s are u@@ s@@ ers of two @-@ w@@ h@@ e@@ el@@ ed v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es , m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s and c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s , for which roads are also in@@ t@@ en@@ ded .
for cultural and c@@ li@@ ma@@ ti@@ c reasons , there are an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary number of these accidents in certain Member States .
serious st@@ u@@ di@@ es have con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of serious accidents or de@@ a@@ th@@ s a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st these groups result from im@@ pa@@ c@@ ts with c@@ ra@@ s@@ h b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers , that is to say , against ro@@ ad@@ si@@ d@@ e pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers or against ver@@ ti@@ c@@ al road si@@ g@@ n@@ s , both of which are de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed and c@@ re@@ ated for f@@ our @-@ w@@ h@@ e@@ el@@ ed v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es .
the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of these accidents ha@@ p@@ p@@ en at the b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s which some Member States are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ating and i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying .
my amendment of the le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposal on the de@@ si@@ g@@ n and pla@@ c@@ ing of these s@@ o@@ f@@ t pro@@ te@@ c@@ tive b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers at these b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s is not therefore gra@@ t@@ u@@ it@@ ous .
we must not be sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with a m@@ er@@ e re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to the Member States or le@@ a@@ ve this simply to be de@@ al@@ t with through su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , which would g@@ re@@ at@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t its implementation .
we must now be b@@ ol@@ d .
let us le@@ g@@ is@@ late , let us se@@ e@@ k a greater de@@ g@@ re@@ e of h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation , let us promote measures for the ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al and sa@@ f@@ e use of roads by p@@ ed@@ e@@ st@@ ri@@ ans and c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s , and let us se@@ e@@ k for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ s to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce he@@ a@@ v@@ y tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic , at least in p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted areas ; let us h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its by means of an a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous legal framework , as the Commission re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 6 , th@@ e@@ re@@ by re@@ mo@@ v@@ ing the Member States &apos; in@@ er@@ ti@@ a .
let us be v@@ i@@ g@@ il@@ ant of the environmental impact of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic , such as no@@ ise and environmental p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion .
I would also like to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate the importance of le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ ting on the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m per@@ m@@ it@@ ted levels of al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
finally , I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so very open to our proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the ap@@ p@@ al@@ l@@ ing fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e of 4@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 de@@ a@@ th@@ s a year on the roads of the European Union , the e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted 1@@ .@@ 7 million in@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es , are a con@@ st@@ ant re@@ min@@ d@@ er that we must give to@@ p priority to the issue of road safety .
these fi@@ gu@@ res do not only re@@ p@@ res@@ ent im@@ m@@ en@@ se per@@ s@@ on@@ al su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing , they also mean en@@ or@@ m@@ ous economic l@@ o@@ s@@ ses and costs .
these are e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted at EUR 1@@ 00 b@@ il@@ li@@ on , ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting for some 2 % of the g@@ ro@@ s@@ s d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t of all the European Member States .
that is more than all the European Union Member States put together s@@ pen@@ d on c@@ ul@@ ture .
I want to give w@@ ar@@ m th@@ an@@ ks to the rapporteur and I especially welcome the fact that she has con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted on three priority areas : acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion , in@@ j@@ ur@@ y pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion and p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ impact c@@ are and re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation .
in my view that makes it clear that road safety cannot be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed to the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red level by in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al , s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive measures but only by a whole ra@@ f@@ t of measures , which in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de road u@@ se@@ r education , s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its , al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ its , better road infrastructure , tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic control systems , im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le safety st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds , st@@ r@@ ic@@ ter ch@@ ec@@ ks on ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ance of road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic rules and also con@@ st@@ ant as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es on the roads .
that is why I find it extremely re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble that the amendment on h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing the r@@ e @-@ re@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion of c@@ ar@@ s that have been involved in accidents in the European Union was not adopted , although in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent reports clearly d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that there is a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al l@@ in@@ k between v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es that have been in an acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent once and their r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ed in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in accidents with an en@@ su@@ ing h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er death t@@ ol@@ l .
I just want to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er for a moment .
you know I tabled an amendment concerned in particular with the question of m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s and safety b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers , and I would be g@@ la@@ d if you and your group could en@@ d@@ or@@ se it t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , since I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f am a m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t and am therefore ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly very f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with this problem .
Mr President , I can only support the Commission in not p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing a Community regulation on b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l con@@ t@@ ent .
my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es are h@@ ol@@ ding a s@@ ha@@ m debate , a to@@ t@@ ally s@@ ha@@ m debate .
the s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s and our group dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly a year ago , when the proposals from the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous per@@ i@@ o@@ d were taken up again , that we do not want Community legislation here .
the point we make is this : we want ch@@ ec@@ ks .
that is the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al question , not what the law sa@@ y@@ s .
it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to have on @-@ the @-@ s@@ p@@ o@@ t ch@@ ec@@ ks .
here I can only re@@ p@@ ly to my U@@ K c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e : if your p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e carried out ch@@ ec@@ ks over C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ t@@ ma@@ s , it would take these people o@@ f@@ f the roads and pre@@ v@@ ent the accidents .
so I can only re@@ p@@ e@@ at that the c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al f@@ ac@@ to@@ r is to ch@@ ec@@ k the b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l level rather than to issue a Community regulation .
that is why we will re@@ j@@ ec@@ t the first part of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 4 .
if it is n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s carried , my group will re@@ j@@ ec@@ t Mrs P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en &apos;s en@@ ti@@ r@@ e resolution , because it is h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ical to call for Community legislation when there is no need w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever for it .
t@@ al@@ k to your countries .
most countries agree with the common view of this House that 0@@ .@@ 5 par@@ ts per th@@ ou@@ s@@ and is quite a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , as the Commission ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly said .
that is what we re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed to all these countries .
the people you should t@@ al@@ k to , Mr W@@ att@@ s , are those who do not apply that .
so it is not a question of a s@@ ha@@ m debate or of what the law sa@@ y@@ s ; the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e must c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out @-@ on @-@ the s@@ p@@ o@@ t ch@@ ec@@ ks and p@@ ic@@ k out all the d@@ r@@ un@@ k@@ en d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s .
that will give us the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st road safety .
secondly , we will not accept A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 6 either , with which the G@@ re@@ en@@ s are once again t@@ r@@ ying to start another s@@ ha@@ m debate , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y on a general s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ it of 1@@ 20 k@@ m / h .
we already have s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its on most European roads .
in my country we have s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its on 9@@ 5 % of all roads .
where do the accidents ha@@ p@@ p@@ en ?
on the 9@@ 5 % of roads , because there are not enough s@@ p@@ e@@ ed ch@@ ec@@ ks there either .
so , fe@@ w@@ er la@@ ws and more ch@@ ec@@ ks will do more for road safety .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a k@@ no@@ w@@ n fact that , if death from ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ tive weapons is due to human in@@ s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity , then de@@ a@@ th@@ s from road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents are due ma@@ in@@ ly to human st@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ity .
and it not only be@@ h@@ o@@ v@@ es an or@@ g@@ an@@ ised state not to be st@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ d in its own ac@@ ts and om@@ is@@ si@@ ons ; it must also pro@@ te@@ c@@ t its citizens from the consequences of their own st@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ity .
it is as part of this en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our that the excellent report by our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w m@@ em@@ b@@ er , Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en , on the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the priorities in road safety defin@@ es the way forward .
action is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed on three f@@ r@@ on@@ ts : first , by taking le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive , re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y action , secondly , by pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es in v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es and in the road infrastructure and , th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , by taking ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive action and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing an information c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n .
of course , if we take c@@ are to ensure that any measures taken rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d support , then they will be even more effective and if , at the same time , we draw on the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences of the Member States in these areas , then we shall be sure to st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e a ha@@ p@@ p@@ y m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m .
for example , everyone could agree to a d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion in al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l levels for certain c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ ies of d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s , such as those c@@ ar@@ r@@ ying d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous l@@ o@@ ad@@ s .
in addition , m@@ od@@ er@@ n te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y can and should be used in order to put the measures dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed into practice and to control the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of current pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons .
and , of course , we should mo@@ b@@ il@@ ise local society and regional bo@@ di@@ es and ensure that they are more c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y involved in road safety issues by ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the people di@@ rec@@ tly . at the same time , the information c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n must , of course , continue to r@@ u@@ n , using c@@ le@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ r w@@ a@@ y@@ s of g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing through to the public , especially young people .
l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise , it might be wor@@ th ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ing the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of re@@ w@@ ar@@ ding the sa@@ f@@ est v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es through the road tax system and d@@ em@@ an@@ ding min@@ im@@ u@@ m safety s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ations de@@ pen@@ ding on the t@@ y@@ p@@ e of road , so that road de@@ si@@ g@@ n and con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion can be in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into programmes su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised by the European Union .
finally , we call on the Commission not to &quot; ra@@ ce &quot; through cases such as today &apos;s .
that is what road safety needs .
Mr President , the f@@ re@@ qu@@ ency of road accidents is so tra@@ g@@ i@@ c and so un@@ de@@ re@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted as to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the ad@@ op@@ tion of all possible initiatives as s@@ o@@ on as possible at all levels of government and on all aspects of the matter , including human be@@ ha@@ v@@ i@@ our , the infrastructure and v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es .
the only s@@ el@@ ec@@ tion c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a we need - although I fe@@ a@@ r this will be difficult , given the nature of the debate th@@ us far - is to i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy the op@@ er@@ ations which would be most effective p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y because they are si@@ m@@ p@@ le to implement .
I believe that the areas of human be@@ ha@@ v@@ i@@ our and in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res are those in which we can ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t the qu@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ t results : for example , the results of making it man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y to w@@ e@@ a@@ r a h@@ el@@ m@@ e@@ t and se@@ at b@@ el@@ ts were re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ ble in I@@ t@@ al@@ y .
m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t de@@ a@@ th@@ s have f@@ al@@ l@@ en by 4@@ 5 % ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s all the age groups since it was made man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y to w@@ e@@ a@@ r a h@@ el@@ m@@ e@@ t last year .
I am aware that measures such as making it com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y to w@@ e@@ a@@ r se@@ at b@@ el@@ ts and h@@ el@@ m@@ et@@ s can be difficult to en@@ force , to implement , and that if they are not im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted then they are m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ less , m@@ e@@ re@@ ly words on pa@@ per .
however , this does not mean that we should dis@@ regard the d@@ r@@ in@@ k @-@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing issue , and I would therefore not be against s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er common b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ its , even though I@@ t@@ al@@ y might l@@ o@@ s@@ e out s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly .
Mr President , we shall be v@@ o@@ ting in favour of the report on priorities in EU road safety , as it in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a number of p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al measures which may re@@ d@@ u@@ ce , at least s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly , the number of de@@ a@@ th@@ s in road accidents .
it is de@@ pl@@ or@@ able that road accidents re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the most common cause of death a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st children and ad@@ ul@@ ts under 4@@ 5 years .
however , although most of the measures are positive , they ta@@ r@@ get m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s al@@ one , th@@ us ab@@ s@@ ol@@ v@@ ing c@@ a@@ r man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s as well as the government , and society in general , of any responsibility .
what is the point of measures , b@@ in@@ ding or o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , to encourage m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s to k@@ e@@ e@@ p their s@@ p@@ e@@ ed down , when c@@ a@@ r man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s not only pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce c@@ ar@@ s that g@@ re@@ at@@ ly ex@@ c@@ e@@ ed s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its but even make this a s@@ el@@ ling point ?
what is the point of c@@ al@@ l@@ ing upon m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s to be c@@ a@@ re@@ ful and to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the time they s@@ pen@@ d at the w@@ h@@ e@@ e@@ l , when , in the qu@@ est for prof@@ it , the road ha@@ u@@ la@@ ge industry and large re@@ ta@@ i@@ l and in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al com@@ p@@ an@@ ies force l@@ or@@ r@@ y d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s to d@@ ri@@ ve until they are extremely ti@@ red ?
what is the point of la@@ m@@ en@@ ting the fact that road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for 9@@ 5 % of accidents in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing all for@@ m@@ s of transport - there is h@@ ence no possible com@@ par@@ is@@ on with tra@@ in@@ s or a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t - if every government &apos; s policy is to encourage road transport , op@@ en@@ ly or im@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly , over all other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of transport , for both the public and f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
even in Europe &apos; s r@@ ic@@ h@@ est countries , public transport is under@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed and many people use their c@@ ar@@ s not through c@@ h@@ o@@ ice but out of n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ity , due to a lack of a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate public transport .
in the ra@@ ce for prof@@ it and z@@ er@@ o st@@ o@@ c@@ k , large com@@ p@@ an@@ ies are for@@ c@@ ed to see road transport as part of their production line and this trans@@ for@@ m@@ s some m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s into a long , al@@ most en@@ d@@ less c@@ ha@@ in of l@@ or@@ ri@@ es .
even on the l@@ im@@ ited question of t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k @-@ on @-@ tra@@ in te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s in ac@@ t@@ u@@ al practice is the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite of the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al line .
on a more general no@@ te , a s@@ en@@ si@@ ble approach to transport would re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a s@@ en@@ si@@ ble approach to man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing , an approach , in other words , that does not place prof@@ it above all el@@ se .
this , however , is a far c@@ r@@ y from the la@@ u@@ g@@ ha@@ ble measures proposed by the Commission and by this report .
Mr President , V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , I ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s while pre@@ par@@ ing this sh@@ or@@ t in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion and I was s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed to dis@@ co@@ v@@ er that , st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ ally at least , more than 5@@ 5 people have been k@@ il@@ led on the roads of the European Union since we con@@ v@@ en@@ ed this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
the European Union l@@ o@@ ses 4 people an h@@ our .
road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents are the most common cause of death a@@ m@@ on@@ g children and young people .
every year , we l@@ o@@ s@@ e a uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity or large sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l full of young people no less , because 1@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 young people di@@ e on our roads every year .
ad@@ d to that the fact that I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally have the un@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ y p@@ ri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge of com@@ ing from the Member State with the second h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est number of f@@ a@@ ta@@ l accidents in Europe .
and what is more , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e is the only country in Europe in which , unfortunately , there has been no d@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ w@@ ar@@ d t@@ r@@ end over the last t@@ en years .
en@@ ti@@ r@@ e f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies are being sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ ed on the as@@ p@@ h@@ al@@ t al@@ ter .
road safety can , and must , be a to@@ p priority both for the whole of Europe and for each in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al country , which is why I shall support the proposal made by Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I should like to congratulate on her report , that we need st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c pl@@ an@@ n@@ ing for road safety and we need to set a s@@ er@@ ies of st@@ r@@ ic@@ t but re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ical ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s .
this will att@@ ra@@ c@@ t citizens &apos; attention and provide an effective f@@ o@@ c@@ al point .
we , ladies and gentlemen , have a h@@ u@@ ge responsibility both here and in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s .
it is , for example , un@@ for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ate that no le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive proposal has been su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted on the com@@ pu@@ l@@ s@@ or@@ y ad@@ op@@ tion of the f@@ our t@@ y@@ p@@ es of te@@ st de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to make c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts sa@@ f@@ er for p@@ ed@@ e@@ st@@ ri@@ ans , a re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch programme which , it should be no@@ ted , the European Union has been funding for the past 2@@ 2 years .
in addition , further support for the European programme to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate no@@ v@@ ice d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s , support for st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es to promote the use of se@@ at b@@ el@@ ts , the development of te@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ s systems , the man@@ d@@ at@@ or@@ y f@@ it@@ t@@ ing of d@@ a@@ y@@ time r@@ un@@ n@@ ing li@@ g@@ h@@ ts to m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ b@@ i@@ k@@ es and c@@ ar@@ s and other proposals in the report could b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it road safety and public health en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s@@ ly at re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y little c@@ o@@ s@@ t .
Mrs D@@ e P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o , I am sure that you are f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with part of your com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation which h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts a dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing dis@@ par@@ ity between the different Member States in the quality and safety of roads and number of v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s c@@ la@@ im@@ ed .
unfortunately , this dis@@ par@@ ity c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y m@@ i@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ s the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the quality and s@@ p@@ e@@ ed of economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of the Member States of the European Union : the sa@@ f@@ est country is Sweden and the least sa@@ f@@ e countries are G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al .
what does this mean ?
I will at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to an@@ s@@ w@@ er this question as p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y as possible : it means we cannot in@@ v@@ est in safety without in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing in Community action .
I feel that Parliament , with a few le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions , is c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for greater c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge from the Commission , and I would therefore like to thank the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Member for her report , which makes the Commission &apos;s com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation to@@ t@@ ally clear and more effective .
more c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge - to get st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t to the point - means two things : firstly an un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king to s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy l@@ im@@ its and rules in our pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion policy , or - without w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to o@@ f@@ f@@ end Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i - any control will be u@@ s@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s .
if we are going to control the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed at which people d@@ ri@@ ve , it does make quite a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence whether the l@@ im@@ it we set is 1@@ 00 or 2@@ 00 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ res per h@@ our .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to d@@ r@@ in@@ king .
we feel that the Commission should present a directive se@@ t@@ t@@ ing the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it at 0@@ .@@ 5 par@@ ts per th@@ ou@@ s@@ and for all the Member States .
I say this as a c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of a country which has e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er l@@ im@@ it p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y in order to f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ all any acc@@ u@@ sa@@ tion of s@@ el@@ f @-@ interest in our ar@@ gu@@ ment .
the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity is all very well - although I feel that it would be g@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ly in@@ appropriate to take a@@ way the l@@ ic@@ ences of all d@@ r@@ un@@ k d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s - but the problem is working out at what point a d@@ ri@@ v@@ er is to be con@@ si@@ de@@ red d@@ r@@ un@@ k acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to our h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ way c@@ od@@ e .
Commissioner , I feel that em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ying this s@@ or@@ t of c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge is the si@@ m@@ pl@@ est and most effective , but also the only way of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing the a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous objective we have set ourselves of re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the number of v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s c@@ la@@ im@@ ed by the roads of the European Union by 4@@ 0 % over the next few years .
Mr President , let me thank the rapporteur for the great commitment she has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n in this matter .
last year , n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly 4@@ 3@@ ,@@ 000 people were k@@ il@@ led on the road n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks of the EU .
one of the main reasons for this was the use of al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
there is no g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing a@@ way from this fact .
si@@ x years in the European Parliament have given me great respect for the fact that we have t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ou@@ s@@ ly di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on many issues , but we should all agree that al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l and d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing n@@ e@@ v@@ er go together .
despite this , people are k@@ il@@ led every day on the road n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks of the EU because of this p@@ rec@@ ise com@@ b@@ in@@ ation .
we can also en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in very different op@@ in@@ i@@ ons as to whether we should have common rules within the EU or whether each country should s@@ ol@@ ve this problem on its own .
allow me to point out two things for those who are in two min@@ ds about this issue .
my first point is that no EU country would find it acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble if another Member State t@@ ol@@ er@@ ated a situation in which a tra@@ in d@@ ri@@ v@@ er , an a@@ ir@@ line p@@ il@@ o@@ t f@@ l@@ ying an a@@ er@@ op@@ l@@ an@@ e with 3@@ 00 pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers on bo@@ ar@@ d or a se@@ a c@@ ap@@ ta@@ in responsible for the safety of 1@@ 000 people or were to d@@ r@@ in@@ k al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l before he or she as@@ su@@ m@@ ed responsibility for his or her pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ ers .
why is it , then , that we do not im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e the same re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment on those who d@@ ri@@ ve on our roads ?
the other point I want to make is that 9@@ 5 % of f@@ a@@ ta@@ l tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents actually take place on the roads .
all I want is that we should take the problem of these 9@@ 5 % as s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly as we do the problem of the 5 % of accidents which o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with the other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of transport .
that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why I consider the report to be an i@@ d@@ e@@ al basis for our future work on this issue , which is also why I am going to vote in favour of it t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , safety on Europe &apos;s roads is a v@@ it@@ al matter and the fi@@ gu@@ res speak for themselves : 4@@ 2 000 de@@ a@@ th@@ s a year and 1@@ .@@ 7 million people in@@ j@@ u@@ red .
something has to be done about this .
we must se@@ e@@ k to make our roads sa@@ f@@ er .
there is very great su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing a@@ m@@ on@@ g those who l@@ o@@ s@@ e a family m@@ em@@ b@@ er as a result of a c@@ a@@ r acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent .
our society is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly mo@@ b@@ il@@ e , and I am in favour of it .
but that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why it is our d@@ u@@ ty to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the r@@ is@@ ks .
here , we as p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans must as@@ su@@ me our responsibility towards society at European , as also at national and regional level , and call for better and more a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic measures .
the an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of road accidents is dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve .
the way to com@@ p@@ il@@ e acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s therefore in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es rec@@ or@@ d@@ ing , pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing and in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ting acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent d@@ at@@ a .
a s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation of what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s on the roads can provide important d@@ at@@ a to help ensure greater safety and pre@@ v@@ ent accidents .
the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d of transport m@@ od@@ es , as also road de@@ si@@ g@@ n and people themselves , are w@@ e@@ a@@ k points .
we must i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fy and se@@ e@@ k where possible to re@@ m@@ ed@@ y them .
I see this as a most important as@@ p@@ ec@@ t .
and here I think road u@@ se@@ r education is essential .
we must ra@@ ise people &apos;s a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the d@@ an@@ g@@ ers and r@@ is@@ ks involved in road use , as the pre@@ con@@ d@@ ition for their acc@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ an@@ ce of measures .
even children , a s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally high @-@ r@@ is@@ k group of road u@@ s@@ ers , must be ta@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t through pla@@ y how to be@@ have on the roads .
young people must be in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of the r@@ is@@ ks they and other road u@@ s@@ ers f@@ ac@@ e once they have ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed their d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing l@@ ic@@ ence .
one point is especially c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to my he@@ ar@@ t : measures against d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing but also against the use of m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es and d@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ s when d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
many measures have already been taken to com@@ b@@ at d@@ r@@ in@@ k d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing , including many a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s @-@ ra@@ is@@ ing measures .
yet people often do not re@@ al@@ ise that taking d@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ s and m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es can c@@ l@@ ou@@ d their min@@ ds and a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t their d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing just as much .
the EU road safety programme a@@ im@@ s to defin@@ e the main priorities clearly .
above all , we need to take a s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c approach to these problems .
it is v@@ it@@ al to call for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , road accidents are the most f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent cause of death and serious in@@ j@@ ur@@ y a@@ m@@ on@@ g children and young people , in fact g@@ en@@ er@@ ally a@@ m@@ on@@ g EU citizens under the age of 4@@ 5 .
we must no longer accept this as a st@@ ro@@ k@@ e of f@@ ate but must do something about it .
the con@@ d@@ ition , however , is that we st@@ o@@ p b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing that road safety de@@ pen@@ ds pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y on how well road u@@ s@@ ers be@@ have or re@@ main in control of themselves .
a@@ part from se@@ t@@ t@@ ing out a clear ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation , A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 4@@ 1 and 9@@ 4 of the E@@ C Treaty also provide us with the legal basis which some Members of this House d@@ ou@@ b@@ t for a great number of effective measures to improve road u@@ se@@ r safety .
it is up to us finally to at@@ ta@@ ch a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate political priority to this issue .
in fact , there is perhaps h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly any policy area in which the common responsibility of the EU , the Member States , regional and local authorities and the appropriate organisations is rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised so clearly .
su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity is , therefore , particularly ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able here .
that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why we should not un@@ de@@ re@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ te the ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e of EU measures ver@@ su@@ s Member State efforts .
c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tions of the economic costs of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents s@@ how that they are con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er than the costs of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents .
so that j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ ies the call for in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d financial resources even in ti@@ m@@ es of economic a@@ u@@ st@@ er@@ ity .
but be@@ w@@ are , let us make no mis@@ take .
it is not always the case that the more money we put in , the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er the level of safety we can achieve .
this can be d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted by information c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s on best practice in the EU st@@ a@@ tes and b@@ in@@ ding measures to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of accidents , such as al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l , d@@ r@@ u@@ g @-@ taking and the use of m@@ ed@@ ic@@ in@@ es , as also a directive on ex@@ p@@ an@@ ding safety te@@ st@@ s which will make the c@@ a@@ r industry take a more c@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ ve approach and pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing the European N@@ e@@ w C@@ a@@ r A@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me ( E@@ u@@ ro@@ N@@ C@@ A@@ P ) .
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en , on her excellent report and ur@@ ge you to en@@ d@@ or@@ se it .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to l@@ is@@ t@@ en to this discussion and it will be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to continue working on the issue of road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic safety in Parliament after this discussion and after our decision t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
I am t@@ ol@@ d that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the political groups consider a regulation at European level on al@@ co@@ h@@ ol@@ ic con@@ t@@ ent to be pre@@ f@@ er@@ able , since this is an ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve com@@ p@@ et@@ ence which we can u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e by v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ e of the Treaty .
I agree with Mr S@@ t@@ en@@ mar@@ c@@ k when he sa@@ y@@ s - and this is made pla@@ in by the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous discussion - that we should n@@ e@@ v@@ er accept safety levels that are l@@ o@@ w@@ er than those which it is possible to bring about .
however , this is something we do accept when it comes to roads but which , of course , we do not where a@@ v@@ i@@ ation is concerned .
in my opinion , it is important to have such a regulation at European level where al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l is concerned .
Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i p@@ res@@ en@@ ted some in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing v@@ i@@ e@@ ws but , un@@ like Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i , I think that we should u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e the opportunity of is@@ su@@ ing a directive as well as in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s and other al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es .
we need to u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e all opportunities , and that is what we shall do .
we have not said no to a directive before .
now , we have the ch@@ ance of taking a political initiative , so let us do so .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now , Mr B@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ is@@ t@@ a , to the issue of b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s , which was raised by the G@@ re@@ en@@ s , I believe that it is important for us to k@@ e@@ e@@ p an e@@ y@@ e on what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s .
it would be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing to see a report on the situation out there in the Union .
I am well aware of the fact that this is an important issue for c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s and m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
finally , there is the matter of education and the situation of children .
just as Mrs S@@ ch@@ i@@ er@@ h@@ u@@ b@@ er said , we need to have road safety education .
we must u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e this opportunity , together with all the other measures at national , local , regional , and European level .
we must make v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ous j@@ o@@ in@@ t efforts to this end .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly on the very th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h motion for a resolution which she has pre@@ pa@@ red on road safety . this d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the European Parliament &apos; s interest - which we have seen today in your s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es - in c@@ re@@ ating an a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous policy for com@@ b@@ ating the s@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ ge of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents .
I would also like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my gra@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de to all of you who have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en , who have given v@@ o@@ ice to your op@@ in@@ i@@ ons and who have en@@ r@@ ic@@ h@@ ed this debate .
in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the European Parliament &apos; s request , I would re@@ mind you that last M@@ ar@@ ch the Commission p@@ res@@ en@@ ted a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on road safety which l@@ is@@ ted a s@@ er@@ ies of con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted over the next few years , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally the last two years of implementation of the second action programme on road safety .
I would like to st@@ res@@ s that , in general , I am in com@@ p@@ le@@ te agreement with the con@@ t@@ ents of the report and also with what the resolution itself sa@@ y@@ s , both with regard to the action programme under way , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e implementation will s@@ o@@ on be com@@ p@@ le@@ ted , and with regard to the future road safety programme which the Commission in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to present in the next few m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
I also wish the European Union to have an effective and la@@ st@@ ing policy for re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the number of accidents , which is currently com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
in the first stage we will have to implement the fin@@ al priority measures e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed within the framework of the road safety programme , which is currently under way and , in particular , pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e that the ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation to in@@ st@@ all s@@ p@@ e@@ ed @-@ l@@ im@@ it@@ ing de@@ v@@ ic@@ es be ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to a greater number of l@@ or@@ ri@@ es , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally by l@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ing the t@@ on@@ n@@ age above which such a m@@ e@@ a@@ sure is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we will have to promote the ex@@ change of information on b@@ lack s@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ s and the te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es for re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing them and , in general , to increase the safety of road in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and adopt measures to improve the c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts in the e@@ v@@ ent of c@@ ol@@ l@@ is@@ ion with v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able u@@ s@@ ers of the road n@@ et@@ work .
these road im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents must in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a different de@@ si@@ g@@ n for current c@@ ra@@ s@@ h b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers , which are en@@ or@@ m@@ ou@@ s@@ ly un@@ f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly to c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s and m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
the second stage must in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the ad@@ op@@ tion of a more s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c approach with regard to the future action programme , for which we must establish qu@@ an@@ ti@@ fi@@ able objectives on a European sc@@ al@@ e , which will be d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up with the cooperation of the Member States , in order to achieve greater e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ ity between the measures adopted in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s and those e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on a national level .
because it is clear that the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of specific objectives - as we have seen in those countries which have adopted them - pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a st@@ im@@ u@@ l@@ u@@ s and has the effect of a p@@ s@@ y@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical in@@ c@@ en@@ tive on the authorities , which le@@ ad@@ s to them ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ ing better control and therefore to a re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion in accidents .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , I do not in@@ t@@ end today to deal with the aspects on which we agree - you know these from the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation - but I would like to ex@@ p@@ and a little more on the reasons for the two points of dis@@ agreement .
the first is d@@ r@@ in@@ k @-@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
ladies and gentlemen , you are ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly right .
y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day or the day before , the w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en procedure on the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation for 0@@ .@@ 5 to be the ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m l@@ im@@ it for al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l in the b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d was finally adopted by the Commission .
the d@@ ate is pu@@ re@@ ly co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ en@@ ta@@ l .
it was in the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation in M@@ ar@@ ch .
you must not believe that there has been any man@@ o@@ e@@ u@@ v@@ r@@ ing by an@@ y@@ one .
I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t that this was at a more ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed stage .
I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y .
p@@ le@@ a@@ se do not i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that the d@@ ate has been in any way ch@@ o@@ s@@ en to co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e with this debate .
but I would like to ex@@ pla@@ in why no proposal for a directive is being p@@ res@@ en@@ ted .
this is not being done for two f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l reasons .
firstly , I must say that the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m , one of the countries where the al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it is greater than the 0@@ .@@ 5 which we re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d -@@ as Mr W@@ att@@ s mentioned a moment ago - is the country with the second l@@ o@@ w@@ est number of accidents in the European Union after Sweden .
if G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in had a l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 2 in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of 0@@ .@@ 8 it would pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly be the country with the l@@ o@@ w@@ est number rather than the second l@@ o@@ w@@ est and would have far fe@@ w@@ er accidents .
I do not know .
what I mean to point out is that it is a fact , an objective fact , that G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in , with a l@@ im@@ it of 0@@ .@@ 8 , is the country with the second l@@ o@@ w@@ est number of accidents in the Union .
I am not re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ding 0@@ .@@ 8 but 0@@ .@@ 5 . it is not enough to re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d or to la@@ y down that an al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l l@@ im@@ it be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted if the national authorities then f@@ a@@ i@@ l to a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly control the re@@ al@@ ity of that al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l con@@ t@@ ent in d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s &apos; b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d .
I would like to say to you that if some Member States do not currently control the al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l con@@ t@@ ent in b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d , I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we will have better results just because we have re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed it to 0@@ .@@ 5 .
what we need is better control on the part of the authorities .
secondly , there are c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ s , ha@@ b@@ its and reasons why I feel that this is the c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ c t@@ y@@ p@@ e of issue which should be le@@ f@@ t to su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , and that is why we are only re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ding the level of 0@@ .@@ 5 .
I know that you have a different opinion - I have seen it - and , of course , the t@@ r@@ u@@ th is that , f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , there has not so far been a su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity in the Council to mo@@ ve forward with an initiative of this t@@ y@@ p@@ e .
if , su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly , all the Member States agree , it will be very e@@ as@@ y for them , a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st other things , to implement a level of 0@@ .@@ 5 in their countries .
do not te@@ l@@ l me that the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m w@@ an@@ ts a European directive to res@@ ol@@ ve a problem in G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in because I would not believe it .
then let them implement 0@@ .@@ 5 in the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m .
why do we have to force them to do so ?
if the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m w@@ an@@ ts to do it and we already have a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation , let them com@@ p@@ ly with it .
with regard to c@@ a@@ r f@@ r@@ on@@ ts , I clearly he@@ ar@@ d Mr W@@ att@@ s &apos; s c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m that the Commission pre@@ f@@ ers to speak and not to ac@@ t .
I cannot accept that c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m .
the Commission w@@ is@@ h@@ es to ac@@ t in the most effective way and , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es , d@@ el@@ a@@ ying an initiative for a few m@@ on@@ th@@ s can , in re@@ al@@ ity , be a much qu@@ ic@@ k@@ er way to ensure that it is im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
and we have given the a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ e in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s to re@@ ac@@ h an agreement .
they do not have until 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 , Mr W@@ att@@ s , but until J@@ un@@ e 2001 .
in this respect , I would like to te@@ l@@ l you that this initiative is not only my responsibility but it is also the responsibility of the Commissioner for In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , Mr L@@ i@@ i@@ k@@ an@@ en , and that is what we agreed .
in sa@@ ying this I wish to point out that we have by no means re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted the idea of c@@ re@@ ating a regulation in relation to f@@ r@@ on@@ t se@@ c@@ tions of c@@ ar@@ s which are more res@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ful when it comes to accidents in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing people - un@@ pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted bo@@ di@@ es - but that we simply wish to be even more effective by g@@ a@@ in@@ ing the support of the a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ e sector .
with regard to the future action programme for 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 0 , we are a p@@ ri@@ or@@ i open to all the i@@ d@@ e@@ as in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the motion for a resolution .
I am even pre@@ pa@@ red to re@@ consider the issue of the level of 0@@ .@@ 5 .
I am not going to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in ri@@ g@@ i@@ d p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons on this issue .
I do not believe that that is the main problem .
the problem of control is much more important .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , I am c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting on your cooperation , your help and your support , and I congratulate the rapporteur once again .
Mr President , my n@@ a@@ me was mentioned .
it is important for the rec@@ or@@ d to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy the situation in the U@@ K re@@ la@@ ting to the U@@ K Government &apos;s view on b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l .
I am sure that the D@@ G on T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y has a c@@ op@@ y of the U@@ K &apos;s road safety strategy that was pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in M@@ ar@@ ch 2000 .
it makes it very clear that the new government in the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m is com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion within a European context .
I believe you would now find a much more positive res@@ p@@ on@@ se to a proposal for a directive than perhaps was the case with the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion .
Mr President , on a point of order .
if I have under@@ st@@ o@@ o@@ d my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e cor@@ rec@@ tly , then it is enough to have a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation that the U@@ K Government will l@@ o@@ w@@ er the b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d @-@ al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l level .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity and in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 8 / 2000 ) by Mrs P@@ ol@@ i B@@ or@@ t@@ one , on behalf of the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , on the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the Commission to the European Parliament , the Council and the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Committee on the progress of the implementation of the action programme of the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity and in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport in the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , I will re@@ f@@ ra@@ in from defin@@ ing in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity , ad@@ op@@ ting the defin@@ ition which the Commission itself has used in the past in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d .
however , the op@@ er@@ ations su@@ p@@ por@@ ting in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity are b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing ever more ur@@ g@@ ent for a number of reasons : the need to ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ise tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic and op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e trans@@ por@@ ta@@ tion ti@@ m@@ es , and economic and environmental re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , for in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity is a key el@@ ement in su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able mo@@ bility .
as matters st@@ and , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity p@@ o@@ ses a s@@ er@@ ies of d@@ ra@@ w@@ b@@ ac@@ ks st@@ em@@ m@@ ing from the lack of in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion between the various m@@ od@@ es of transport , together with de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ a@@ r to some of these m@@ od@@ es .
the development of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity h@@ in@@ g@@ es pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y upon the level of e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the ra@@ i@@ l services on o@@ f@@ f@@ er , which unfortunately , in many Member States , ra@@ te p@@ o@@ or@@ ly in terms of quality , e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
mo@@ re@@ over , as the Commission has p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out on se@@ ver@@ al o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons , the development of infrastructure con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on un@@ im@@ od@@ al systems , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport re@@ qu@@ i@@ res a n@@ et@@ work @-@ based approach f@@ o@@ c@@ using on com@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ ity and con@@ n@@ ec@@ tions between the various m@@ od@@ es .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , open in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al information systems able to man@@ age in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport and n@@ et@@ work services e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently and to guarantee a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al and con@@ st@@ ant real @-@ time information and m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge f@@ l@@ o@@ w have yet to be put in place .
a specific an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of the f@@ r@@ ic@@ tion costs al@@ l@@ i@@ ed to in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport re@@ v@@ e@@ als that the main d@@ ra@@ w@@ b@@ ac@@ ks com@@ pa@@ red to tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al un@@ im@@ od@@ al transport can be i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied as high costs , longer time f@@ ra@@ m@@ es , in@@ f@@ er@@ i@@ or quality , h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er r@@ is@@ ks of d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to g@@ o@@ od@@ s , re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions as to the t@@ y@@ p@@ es of g@@ o@@ od@@ s that can be trans@@ por@@ ted , and more com@@ p@@ le@@ x ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures .
these f@@ r@@ ic@@ tion costs can be att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most to the ab@@ s@@ ence of co@@ h@@ er@@ ent system n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks and con@@ n@@ ec@@ tions l@@ in@@ king the la@@ t@@ ter , le@@ ad@@ ing to a l@@ o@@ s@@ s of e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and an increase in trans@@ f@@ er costs .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing prof@@ it@@ ability and s@@ er@@ v@@ ice quality levels a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the various m@@ od@@ es of transport do not si@@ t e@@ a@@ si@@ ly al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e no@@ tions of c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ er sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion and real @-@ time g@@ o@@ od@@ s trans@@ f@@ ers .
the c@@ ul@@ pr@@ it is the ab@@ s@@ ence of b@@ road el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ on@@ ic m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge systems l@@ in@@ king different par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in the in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al c@@ ha@@ in and the lack of an i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fication and information system for g@@ o@@ od@@ s or@@ g@@ an@@ ised on an in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al basis .
L@@ a@@ st@@ ly , the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e system is d@@ o@@ g@@ g@@ ed by a s@@ er@@ ies of bo@@ t@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ ks st@@ em@@ m@@ ing from the ab@@ s@@ ence of h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised time f@@ ra@@ m@@ es and ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ l@@ es a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the various m@@ od@@ es of transport , as a result of which the needs of the f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport c@@ ha@@ in do not cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d to the op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al d@@ em@@ an@@ ds of the resources em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed in the process .
by way of il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tion , the working h@@ ou@@ r@@ s of d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s and c@@ re@@ ws do not t@@ ally with in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al op@@ er@@ ations , and ter@@ min@@ als are not always able to ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ate r@@ ou@@ n@@ d @-@ the @-@ c@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k tra@@ in and sh@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ing ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ l@@ es .
clearly , the in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport framework in Europe v@@ ar@@ ies s@@ om@@ e@@ what , with to@@ t@@ ally con@@ tra@@ st@@ ing c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es ap@@ par@@ ent in the various Member States . h@@ ence the need to acc@@ or@@ d priority to the monitoring of the different c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , with the support of the T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t In@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity T@@ ask F@@ or@@ ce , with a view to s@@ in@@ g@@ ling out specific l@@ in@@ es of action de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s em@@ er@@ g@@ ing priorities in in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States .
the a@@ im@@ s which the EU in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e through the development of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity re@@ la@@ te to the need to establish an in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted system com@@ pr@@ is@@ ing the various transport m@@ od@@ es which o@@ f@@ f@@ ers se@@ a@@ m@@ less , c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ er @-@ ta@@ il@@ o@@ re@@ d d@@ o@@ or @-@ to @-@ d@@ o@@ or services , makes for e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent and c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ effective use of the transport system and pr@@ om@@ o@@ tes com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s .
in its com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity and in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport in the European Union , the Commission h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted the objectives to be pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed in the in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport sector and di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed them into priority areas for action , k@@ no@@ w@@ n as &quot; key actions &quot; : infrastructure and in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted means of transport , in@@ te@@ ro@@ per@@ able and in@@ ter@@ con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic op@@ er@@ ations , and services and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions common to all transport m@@ od@@ es .
the Commission has also pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed a s@@ er@@ ies of h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on@@ ta@@ l measures , using re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical development projects to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce in@@ no@@ va@@ tion a@@ im@@ ed at u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ing new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p in@@ no@@ va@@ tive services and increase pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
clearly , a discussion on in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity re@@ qu@@ i@@ res , at the same time , a sh@@ ar@@ p cultural change in the c@@ ul@@ ture of en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
the g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts are already pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al increase in the d@@ em@@ and for the trans@@ por@@ ta@@ tion of g@@ o@@ od@@ s and com@@ m@@ od@@ ities .
the high g@@ ro@@ w@@ th ra@@ tes are in@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing com@@ p@@ et@@ ition which will in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the v@@ ol@@ u@@ m@@ es trans@@ por@@ ted and , therefore , m@@ er@@ g@@ ers and other for@@ m@@ s of as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation between op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s in the sector will be ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able .
finally , I would like to thank the Members who con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y to the pre@@ par@@ ation of a resolution acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the committee .
I should also like to in@@ for@@ m you that , as far as the few amendments tabled are concerned , I e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally en@@ d@@ or@@ se all of them , with the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 3 , with regard to which I am s@@ om@@ e@@ what per@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ed by the re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to State aid .
Mr President , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity is still in its in@@ f@@ an@@ c@@ y .
not even 8 % of our f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t is trans@@ por@@ ted by se@@ ver@@ al different m@@ od@@ es of transport .
yet the d@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es tra@@ v@@ el@@ led on a@@ ver@@ age have been in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing since as e@@ ar@@ ly as 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 0 , a t@@ r@@ end which f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s the use of more than one m@@ od@@ e of transport .
f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t is g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing out of all pro@@ por@@ tion too , and is ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to increase by 7@@ 0 % over the next t@@ en years .
it is sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing that there is no b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ through in in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport in the o@@ f@@ f@@ ing .
perhaps the p@@ res@@ sure on the trans@@ por@@ ters and the sh@@ i@@ p@@ per@@ s is not yet so great as to bring about this b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ through .
but that being the case , a few w@@ ar@@ n@@ in@@ g@@ s are in order for the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
firstly , the road n@@ et@@ work will not be able to c@@ op@@ e with the 7@@ 0 % increase , not in the ur@@ b@@ an or regional d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion , and not in terms of long d@@ is@@ t@@ ance transport either .
to de@@ pen@@ d ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y on road transport must therefore be de@@ em@@ ed a s@@ in of rec@@ k@@ less f@@ a@@ it@@ h , which used to be a m@@ or@@ ta@@ l s@@ in .
secondly , environmental con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations will pla@@ y an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly important part over the next t@@ en years .
d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing a l@@ or@@ r@@ y through certain par@@ ts of Europe will m@@ e@@ e@@ t with in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing op@@ position .
the people will put up in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly st@@ u@@ b@@ b@@ or@@ n res@@ is@@ t@@ ance to transport v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of their environment .
we have already seen this in the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e of the directive that s@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise b@@ ans on w@@ e@@ e@@ k@@ en@@ d d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
so there is no question of our being able to op@@ t for in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity .
we are being for@@ c@@ ed into it .
now if you take that as your point of de@@ par@@ ture , n@@ one of this is really going to make any he@@ ad@@ way .
of course the se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s must apply themselves more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , and come up with some more in@@ no@@ va@@ tive i@@ d@@ e@@ as , but then the government must get down to work too , and si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y and st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ line procedures , for example .
the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European w@@ a@@ ter n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks must be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to f@@ r@@ u@@ ition qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly and as a matter of priority .
everyone t@@ al@@ ks about ra@@ i@@ l transport , but w@@ a@@ ter transport - where there really is still ro@@ o@@ m for g@@ ro@@ w@@ th - no longer se@@ em@@ s to fe@@ a@@ ture at all in the European or national l@@ is@@ t@@ s of priorities .
no one co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ tes the efforts un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en by each in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al State , when that is su@@ re@@ ly one of the essential ta@@ s@@ ks of the European Commission .
it is a p@@ ity because road transport , in com@@ b@@ in@@ ation with in@@ land n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ ation could make a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in n@@ or@@ th and n@@ or@@ th@@ e@@ a@@ st Europe .
but before we re@@ ac@@ h that point , n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es still have to be c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ d a@@ way in terms of legislation , matters of a technical and p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al nature .
in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the an@@ c@@ i@@ ent practice of co@@ a@@ st@@ al n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ ation , which has long al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed itself to be el@@ bo@@ w@@ ed out , but is now making a p@@ o@@ w@@ er@@ ful com@@ e@@ back under the m@@ od@@ er@@ n n@@ a@@ me of sh@@ or@@ t se@@ a sh@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ing , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing everyone pu@@ l@@ l@@ s together at any ra@@ te .
if we look at the ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ es that have been made since the excellent action programme of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 , then we see a number of positive aspects , for example the ta@@ s@@ k force transport in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity .
the ex@@ t@@ en@@ sion of the P@@ A@@ C@@ T programme , p@@ il@@ o@@ t actions in com@@ b@@ in@@ ed transport , will also s@@ pu@@ r matters on .
in view of the fact that the Union is to under@@ go enlargement and ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ e some new members before long , we must take account of the new situation during the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations even now .
but unfortunately , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport is still too ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve an@@ y@@ way .
this is down to sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s in the field of infrastructure , in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency in the field of management and information , and in@@ no@@ va@@ tions that do not make the gra@@ de .
all the same , we must de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p a t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European transport n@@ et@@ work in the form of a m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ m@@ od@@ al infrastructure n@@ et@@ work , and the b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity and government must j@@ o@@ in for@@ c@@ es at all levels in the process .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in transport policy we still do not pa@@ y in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport the attention it d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es .
h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to , in fact , only 8 % of European f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport is in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al , as my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e just said .
that is why this kind of transport is often not taken s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly enough yet .
but in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al g@@ o@@ od@@ s transport is both the ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion and the m@@ e@@ a@@ sure of the European in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion strategy , which se@@ e@@ ks to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te not only the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al , national transport mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts but also the various transport m@@ od@@ es .
following the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation strategy that is not quite com@@ p@@ le@@ ted yet and the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation that has be@@ gu@@ n , the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market needs this in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion strategy if it is to have a v@@ i@@ able future .
that is why the reports on the progress in im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the action programme for in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport also re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts the progress made in European transport policy .
the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the Commission and the report have raised many , indeed all the important issues : the re@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ ws of the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks a@@ im@@ ed at e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al n@@ et@@ work , measures to c@@ re@@ ate v@@ al@@ u@@ e @-@ ad@@ ded l@@ o@@ g@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ al systems , the measures that are still n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise l@@ o@@ a@@ d un@@ its and so for@@ th , g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al information , st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed transport m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ g@@ es and d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , the development of a uni@@ form in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al li@@ ability re@@ g@@ im@@ e and many others .
here , as we all know , we need a whole r@@ an@@ ge of re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y , political measures to ensure that in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport really has a v@@ i@@ able future .
because the framework conditions are so com@@ p@@ le@@ x and because the development of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport is still far from being a s@@ el@@ f @-@ su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ing process , we need a great number of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful p@@ il@@ o@@ t projects .
so I hope we will get a well @-@ f@@ un@@ d@@ ed new P@@ A@@ C@@ T programme , that will be u@@ sa@@ ble by the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries even at this stage , for it is there that many of the decisions are taken that concern our future .
the si@@ g@@ n@@ als are not all set w@@ r@@ on@@ g there yet .
I also hope that we will give in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport due importance in the S@@ i@@ x@@ th F@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ work R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me .
in our view , in future p@@ il@@ o@@ t projects should look more at st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c aspects , i@@ .@@ e@@ . at l@@ in@@ king up the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al part @-@ n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks .
another as@@ p@@ ec@@ t that has not really been ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed is this : perhaps we could look into the conditions for c@@ re@@ ating new European , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s .
for we do not yet have any real op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s in this area .
perhaps , th@@ e@@ o@@ re@@ ti@@ c@@ ally at least , and as a kind of p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ent , an international com@@ p@@ an@@ y could man@@ age A@@ l@@ p@@ ine t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t transport on an in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al basis .
of course we are also in favour of the European R@@ e@@ f@@ er@@ ence C@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e for In@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ is@@ m that k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ s being an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed and hope it will s@@ o@@ on become a re@@ al@@ ity .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
our group is in favour of ad@@ op@@ ting the report with its amendments .
at present in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity is ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve o@@ w@@ ing to f@@ r@@ ic@@ tion costs , in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , f@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ wor@@ ks of infrastructure , and par@@ tly also because road transport t@@ en@@ ds to be f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red .
the report and the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e many actions wor@@ th@@ y of support that would increase the v@@ ol@@ u@@ me of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport .
new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y must be u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ed e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , for example in in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing e@@ b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , so that the most su@@ it@@ able r@@ ou@@ te and services can be ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed for various s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
I would also like to point out that this form of transport is the most e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent system for long j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ e@@ y@@ s .
in the development of transport f@@ ac@@ il@@ ities , priority must be given to re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e regions and areas which are s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed in terms of the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks .
the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tion and d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion systems in con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed areas is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to thank both the Commission and our rapporteur for their work on this issue .
we have already said a great deal on this subject , and so I shall k@@ e@@ e@@ p this very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f .
we have been able to as@@ certain that a m@@ od@@ al sh@@ i@@ f@@ t has taken place in recent years , although the m@@ an@@ n@@ er in which , and the ex@@ t@@ ent to which , this has taken place has been very l@@ o@@ w @-@ key to d@@ ate .
we want to give this t@@ r@@ end a h@@ u@@ ge bo@@ o@@ s@@ t .
that being the case , it is important that the m@@ od@@ al@@ ities themselves , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally ra@@ i@@ l , internal and co@@ a@@ st@@ al n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ ation , are bo@@ om@@ ing and that political f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s have been g@@ r@@ an@@ ted too , in the form of li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation , in@@ te@@ ro@@ per@@ ability and a number of other things which the sector can use to se@@ i@@ z@@ e its opportunities .
yet we would also like to increase the number of opportunities available to S@@ M@@ E@@ s , in particular , although this s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es en@@ ta@@ il@@ s financial assistance .
that is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y why we have tabled an amendment for for@@ m@@ s of state aid to S@@ M@@ E@@ s , also for environmental pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses .
in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , I am not in agreement with the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed by the G@@ al@@ il@@ e@@ o pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t in these matters , but that is something we should dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s on another o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion .
I would point out that the al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing increase in transport , also as a result of e @-@ com@@ m@@ er@@ ce , means that unfortunately , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport is just a d@@ ro@@ p in the o@@ c@@ e@@ an at the moment , but will have to make he@@ ad@@ way in the future .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , road safety , in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity , the costs of transport infrastructure : my per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive on these issues , pla@@ c@@ ed one after the other on today &apos;s agenda , is that of one who is concerned with the problems of m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in@@ ous areas , particularly the A@@ l@@ p@@ s .
the subject of road safety b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s to mind the M@@ on@@ t B@@ l@@ an@@ c t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y , which is an example of the need for European co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing safety in both op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ el@@ s and those under con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion .
then there is the matter of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the A@@ l@@ p@@ s , where , a@@ part from the S@@ w@@ is@@ s decision to in@@ v@@ est he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y in ra@@ i@@ l transport , there are serious d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the other l@@ in@@ ks and the other new ra@@ i@@ l t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ el@@ s already pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for by Community d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , such as those al@@ on@@ g the T@@ ur@@ in @-@ L@@ y@@ ons @-@ B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ er l@@ in@@ k , or under discussion , such as the A@@ o@@ st@@ a @-@ M@@ ar@@ ti@@ g@@ n@@ y t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l .
clearly , if the w@@ ise sa@@ y@@ in@@ g@@ s &quot; W@@ h@@ o@@ ever b@@ re@@ a@@ ks it pa@@ y@@ s for it &quot; or &quot; P@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ter pa@@ y@@ s &quot; c@@ ro@@ p up in a discussion on the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of the roads , then , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , there needs to be fe@@ w@@ er he@@ a@@ v@@ y g@@ o@@ od@@ s v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es and more ra@@ i@@ l transport in the A@@ l@@ p@@ ine region in future .
in the sh@@ or@@ t @-@ term , there needs to be se@@ ver@@ e re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion of the number of g@@ o@@ od@@ s v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing through the region , including the M@@ on@@ t B@@ l@@ an@@ c T@@ un@@ n@@ e@@ l when it re@@ op@@ en@@ s at the end of this year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank Mrs P@@ ol@@ i B@@ or@@ t@@ one for this a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous and con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive report , and for her s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , which o@@ f@@ f@@ er great support for the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the Commission in this field .
I would also like to thank all the Members who have s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en in the debate today .
the Commission ag@@ re@@ es that an e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport system for g@@ o@@ od@@ s is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to the Union and the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries and , of course , it is essential if we want to guarantee mo@@ bility in the com@@ ing years .
I believe that the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of an en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed s@@ in@@ g@@ le market , the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of our in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es and the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development of the Union de@@ pen@@ d on this .
the Commission will e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate the in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res in the countries of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe in order th@@ e@@ re@@ by to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the re@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es for the T@@ r@@ an@@ s @-@ European T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t N@@ et@@ work .
the European R@@ e@@ f@@ er@@ ence C@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e for in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport , with its he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , will be op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al this year and will be s@@ ol@@ ic@@ it@@ ing the information which the in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al industry needs and which may help in the c@@ re@@ ation of new policies .
the Commission in@@ t@@ en@@ ds to continue su@@ p@@ por@@ ting in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport , through re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch in the framework programmes for te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and development and also by ex@@ t@@ en@@ ding and en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ing the p@@ il@@ o@@ t actions for com@@ b@@ in@@ ed transport ( the P@@ A@@ C@@ T@@ s ) .
as the report in@@ d@@ ic@@ a@@ tes , we will have to in@@ v@@ est in the necessary infrastructure and its management .
in this respect , there are various s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers - Mr C@@ a@@ ver@@ i , for example - who call for the great transport a@@ x@@ es which are already in the T@@ E@@ N@@ s to be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed .
we wish to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the use of current b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y resources , re@@ con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing their use , in order to promote the large @-@ sc@@ al@@ e as@@ si@@ m@@ il@@ ation of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport by industry .
I must te@@ l@@ l you , ladies and gentlemen , that I hope , given the de@@ g@@ re@@ e of ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment and development , that we are now on the fin@@ is@@ h@@ ing t@@ ou@@ ch@@ es .
with regard to the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on the common transport policy , as well as the d@@ el@@ i@@ very of the re@@ v@@ is@@ ed T@@ r@@ an@@ s @-@ European N@@ et@@ wor@@ ks , which I have pr@@ om@@ ised you , I hope that the Commission will be able to defin@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y ap@@ pro@@ ve a te@@ x@@ t on that issue over the next few w@@ e@@ e@@ ks .
in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport is one of the key el@@ em@@ ents in it .
we are at an important stage in the development of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport , since we have to mo@@ ve on from pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing p@@ il@@ o@@ t actions and projects to en@@ sur@@ ing that industry in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ a@@ tes them in a g@@ en@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ed s@@ en@@ se .
the work that we have un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ en has con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed that the k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , systems and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es ex@@ is@@ t in Europe to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , which f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ a@@ tes the sa@@ f@@ e and d@@ u@@ ra@@ ble transport of g@@ o@@ od@@ s .
the ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing policies that we are going to present will support the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport .
finally , I would like to say that I am in com@@ p@@ le@@ te agreement with the proposals to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ on@@ ic systems , made by different s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers , a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st others the rapporteur , Mr S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ man@@ n and Mr P@@ o@@ h@@ j@@ a@@ m@@ o .
these com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ on@@ ic systems must s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally support in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport : these support in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments are a pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ ite for ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent European transport , which has a good c@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency ra@@ ti@@ o and which res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts the environment .
I am also very ha@@ p@@ p@@ y with the agreement between Parliament and the Commission on this issue and I can as@@ sure you that the services of the T@@ R@@ E@@ N D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al will continue to pla@@ y an ac@@ tive role in the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport .
I would like to end by th@@ an@@ king the rapporteur and all the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers and I hope I will continue being able to c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on your work and cooperation on this subject , when it comes to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on transport .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for the use of transport infrastructure
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 4@@ 5 / 2000 ) by Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a P@@ a@@ ol@@ o , on behalf of the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , on transport infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to present this own @-@ initiative report , d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up by the P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m with the a@@ i@@ m of b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing about progress in an area which I hope our work will help you to understand better .
as you know , it d@@ er@@ i@@ v@@ ed from a 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 Commission G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er , which called for measures to in@@ ter@@ n@@ al@@ ise the external costs in@@ c@@ ur@@ red by environmental , safety and con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations , in order to bring about a f@@ a@@ i@@ re@@ r and more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent system of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing u@@ s@@ ers for access to transport infrastructure .
b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally , the report c@@ al@@ l@@ s upon the Commission to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e by h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing the defin@@ it@@ i@@ ons of internal and external costs , h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing or i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying ch@@ ar@@ ge c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tion m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es , and then , of course , le@@ a@@ v@@ ing the implementation of these measures to su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity and the decisions to be taken by the Member States .
in my opinion , in e@@ s@@ s@@ ence , the report en@@ su@@ res that the re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to apply the &quot; p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ter pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle is in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the w@@ i@@ d@@ er principle of &quot; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s . &quot;
this is its contribution , and it has two consequences which I wish to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e now . the first is that if the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y which we hope the Commission will dec@@ i@@ d@@ e upon and we will be able to en@@ d@@ or@@ se en@@ ab@@ l@@ es us to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r defin@@ ition of the internal and external costs and a c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r system for ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing u@@ s@@ ers , we will c@@ re@@ ate the conditions to be able to trans@@ f@@ er the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of infrastructure from pu@@ re@@ ly public resources and general ta@@ x@@ ation to the u@@ s@@ ers as such .
we can therefore now p@@ ic@@ ture the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous e@@ f@@ for@@ t before Europe - the Europe of today and the Europe of t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w - in the process of con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ting new infrastructure , the e@@ f@@ for@@ t of in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing p@@ ri@@ va@@ te c@@ ap@@ it@@ al in this op@@ er@@ ation as well , which would not be possible if we do not su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed in i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ying this situation .
the next st@@ e@@ p is to consider that , where the att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of some of these costs is m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ less , as , for example , in the case of the I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s , which have already fully ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed their pa@@ y@@ back - the re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e from these ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es which ex@@ is@@ t today could con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te funds to be used in c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es , in order to ensure that certain costs ch@@ ar@@ ged to road u@@ s@@ ers s@@ er@@ ve to improve infrastructure in other m@@ od@@ es of transport which are certainly more en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly .
I would st@@ res@@ s that this whole system , which trans@@ f@@ ers the financial b@@ ur@@ d@@ en from the State to the u@@ se@@ r , must have a sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d , and that is the last principle , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to which those who have the most difficult c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es because they are dis@@ ab@@ led or because they li@@ ve in rural or re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e areas where access is difficult , can in some way be ex@@ em@@ p@@ ted , and a s@@ er@@ ies of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es , including State su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es , can therefore be de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed to com@@ pen@@ sa@@ te for this .
our objective in pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing this report is to draw together certain f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es which I have already mentioned : the &quot; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle , the &quot; p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ter pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle and the principle of c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ is@@ ation et@@ c@@ . together .
how can we do this ?
the m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion given here is that a s@@ er@@ ies of good p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es ex@@ is@@ t now in Europe , which we have at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ted to ex@@ pl@@ or@@ e and put together in a se@@ min@@ ary w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e pa@@ per@@ s we will make available to an@@ y@@ one one who w@@ is@@ h@@ es to st@@ u@@ d@@ y the issue in more de@@ p@@ th and which we have fin@@ an@@ c@@ ed with the help of the Commission .
well then , these p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es can now , in my opinion , be g@@ en@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ed and made available to everyone .
this would make it possible - and I feel that the time is now ri@@ p@@ e - to ob@@ ta@@ in op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ ve in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations for ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ing European policy in this di@@ rec@@ tion in p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al terms .
( de ) Mr President , V@@ ice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , ladies and gentlemen , I want to give high p@@ ra@@ ise to the rapporteur for his su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s in ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing a b@@ road con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s with his report , after we have s@@ p@@ ent years in this House h@@ o@@ t@@ ly de@@ b@@ ating the right way to ch@@ ar@@ ge for transport infrastructure costs .
Commissioner , V@@ ice @-@ President , I hope that after the vote t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w you will per@@ use all the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ts for the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on transport policy again and ch@@ ec@@ k whether they follow the same l@@ in@@ es as proposed by this House .
after all , n@@ or@@ m@@ ally the Commission &apos;s proposals always take account of the Member States &apos; v@@ i@@ e@@ ws , and perhaps in future they will also take more account of Parliament &apos;s v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
I believe that the C@@ o@@ st@@ a report o@@ f@@ f@@ ers an opportunity to r@@ e @-@ think some of the ha@@ b@@ its the various de@@ par@@ t@@ ments have g@@ ro@@ w@@ n so f@@ on@@ d of .
I also hope that we do not m@@ i@@ x up the subject matter of the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er with the subject of the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks .
we are about to re@@ view the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks ; these are both important su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts .
to present them to Parliament as a s@@ in@@ g@@ le pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge would , in my view , be extremely un@@ w@@ ise since they are in fact se@@ par@@ ate su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts .
allow me to make just a few com@@ ments on the C@@ o@@ st@@ a report .
amendment No 1 makes it quite clear that we want use @-@ based transport ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing , which can be ver@@ i@@ fied on the basis of the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , ex@@ p@@ an@@ sion and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement costs .
that is the first issue .
so there are two a@@ im@@ s of which we must not l@@ o@@ s@@ e si@@ g@@ h@@ t when we h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise these transport infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es .
firstly , we must finally achieve a s@@ in@@ g@@ le market in this area .
for when you think that we still have en@@ or@@ m@@ ous d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tions of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition because of di@@ ver@@ g@@ ent f@@ is@@ c@@ al and other ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es between the Member States , a whole 8 @-@ 9 years after the com@@ p@@ le@@ tion of the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market on 3@@ 1 December 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 2 , then the question of e@@ qu@@ al com@@ p@@ et@@ ition is b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to ar@@ ise .
secondly , we really all think that after the m@@ e@@ te@@ or@@ ic r@@ is@@ es in o@@ i@@ l pr@@ ic@@ es over the past year , in w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er way we want to con@@ ver@@ t and achieve a more f@@ a@@ i@@ r and en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble system , the to@@ ta@@ l ch@@ ar@@ ge for un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ s must not r@@ ise .
we do not want any for@@ c@@ ing up of pr@@ ic@@ es .
last point : in relation to external costs I have two re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s .
firstly , about three years ago , Parliament dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed in to@@ to to work out on a s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c basis what the external costs actually are .
how can they be c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ted and how can they be ch@@ ar@@ ged ?
we n@@ e@@ v@@ er received that report .
secondly , we must di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ate when we c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ late these external costs .
to give just one example : con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion costs .
it would be ab@@ sur@@ d to ch@@ ar@@ ge an un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king for the fact that the d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s are st@@ u@@ c@@ k in a ta@@ i@@ l @-@ back because the Member States have not ex@@ p@@ an@@ ded the roads , so that the un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ king not only has h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er p@@ et@@ ro@@ l and working costs but also has to pa@@ y ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es to the Member State responsible for the con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , for his excellent work on what is a very difficult , de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed but important d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er .
con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion , p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion , g@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k , g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ s , f@@ re@@ a@@ k w@@ e@@ a@@ th@@ er .
is it the end of the world ?
no , it is just r@@ u@@ s@@ h @-@ h@@ our in my region .
the same problems are o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing in regions and Member States ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union .
we all have the same transport crisis and there may be common s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to these common problems .
we must all accept the fact , for example , that the f@@ a@@ st@@ est g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing g@@ a@@ se@@ s is the transport sector .
something su@@ re@@ ly , c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , must be done .
however , as we all know , everyone w@@ an@@ ts s@@ om@@ e@@ one el@@ se to do it .
that is our ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge .
I hope Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos;s work , his report and the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons we will re@@ ac@@ h t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w will provide a framework within which we can be@@ g@@ in to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le these problems .
we must promote better under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of our common problems and , indeed , find common s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions to them ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union , but on the basis of con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s and m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al under@@ st@@ an@@ ding .
secondly , we must promote an ex@@ change of i@@ d@@ e@@ as .
many l@@ o@@ c@@ al@@ ities and regions have excellent i@@ d@@ e@@ as , and that k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and information must be dis@@ se@@ min@@ ated throughout the European Union .
indeed , that is my third point : Europe has a key role to pla@@ y here in dis@@ se@@ min@@ ating best practice as to how best we ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the transport ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge .
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly and finally , in terms of what Europe &apos;s contribution can be within the framework of this particular initiative , I hope that governments , local authorities and those im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing ta@@ x@@ es and ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es can do so within a framework that is de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed and in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted at a European level , and do it together .
however , I want to say that there is great concern and an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos;s report , although I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally feel that many of those concerns were fully ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed in committee where , I know , there was w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ par@@ ty support for Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos;s work .
there were concerns , for example , about su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity .
but that was more than a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed when we said to the Commission : you have a key role to pla@@ y in t@@ r@@ ying to pu@@ l@@ l this re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch together .
but , clearly , Member States and their role will be fully res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted in terms of their rights to de@@ ter@@ min@@ e their own ta@@ x@@ ation levels .
indeed , the work we have done has already g@@ a@@ in@@ ed and se@@ c@@ u@@ red w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d support .
I can re@@ f@@ er to a le@@ t@@ ter from the organisation that re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ ing c@@ l@@ u@@ b@@ s ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s Europe , including , for example , the A@@ A and R@@ A@@ C , who are b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c and su@@ p@@ por@@ tive of our work , because they know that un@@ less Europe ta@@ k@@ es a le@@ a@@ d on this issue , un@@ less we be@@ g@@ in pu@@ l@@ ling together the best of the i@@ d@@ e@@ as from ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union , then the c@@ ities , to@@ w@@ n@@ s and rural areas , will continue to su@@ f@@ f@@ er from un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble levels of con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion and p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion .
I com@@ m@@ en@@ d Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos;s report , his work and , above all , his ability to bring us all together in a s@@ in@@ g@@ le common objective of t@@ r@@ ying to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the transport crisis .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , for his most excellent work .
I would also like to say thank you for the in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing debate on the subject with some il@@ l@@ u@@ min@@ ating ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es .
I think it is important that the issue is now being de@@ al@@ t with by Parliament .
the main principle of the report is quite right , that u@@ s@@ ers should pa@@ y for the transport infrastructure and its ma@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ance costs .
ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es for the use of the transport infrastructure must take account of the costs to society , but also the ability @-@ to @-@ pa@@ y principle and the need to support re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e areas .
the importance of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for the use of the transport infrastructure will increase as a means of con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ing the situation in the future .
the system of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es must be f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble and d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c , so that it would o@@ f@@ f@@ er in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es for the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of new technical services .
as there are pl@@ ans , however , for a com@@ b@@ in@@ ation of f@@ a@@ re@@ s and ta@@ x@@ es , we have to take c@@ are that we are not simply le@@ f@@ t with a system of ta@@ x@@ ation .
there are still a l@@ o@@ t of problems at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to a system of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es .
co@@ ver@@ ing over@@ all costs with f@@ a@@ re@@ s will work in areas where there is a l@@ o@@ t of transport .
conditions v@@ ar@@ y re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally , however , to a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ex@@ t@@ ent , so the same b@@ a@@ se@@ s for ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es cannot apply e@@ ver@@ y@@ where .
long d@@ is@@ t@@ an@@ c@@ es , sc@@ at@@ te@@ red p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions and difficult natural conditions must be taken account of when the in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments in respect of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es are de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed , just as the report st@@ a@@ tes .
in my opinion , it is important that we look into the possible impact of the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e before ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing b@@ ec@@ om@@ es a re@@ al@@ ity .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to thank Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , who did , when all is said and done , put in a h@@ u@@ ge a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of work , having st@@ ar@@ ted by following the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of the high @-@ level working group on this subject , because it is an own @-@ initiative report .
ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly , we were le@@ f@@ t with a report that we would have pre@@ f@@ er@@ red , at the very least , to s@@ en@@ d out a different si@@ g@@ n@@ al to the Commission , in particular .
in fact we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t more from the Commission than the si@@ g@@ n@@ al s@@ ent out by what , in a s@@ en@@ se , re@@ ma@@ in@@ s of the C@@ o@@ st@@ a report .
allow me to ex@@ pla@@ in as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws - it will also speak of a certain a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation .
every so often , I ch@@ er@@ ish the hope that we will be su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently c@@ le@@ v@@ er to g@@ a@@ in in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t into a certain per@@ i@@ o@@ d and do what we have to with it .
I have already an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ ted for quite some time that f@@ a@@ i@@ r pr@@ ic@@ ing would be a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al , in@@ te@@ l@@ li@@ g@@ ent debate and would d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er measures .
when I see how long it all ta@@ k@@ es , that is when I start l@@ o@@ s@@ ing pa@@ ti@@ ence .
if I can draw something of a com@@ par@@ is@@ on between the way in which the discussion on the ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the agricultural policy is now taking place against the b@@ ac@@ k@@ d@@ ro@@ p of the problems sur@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ding food safety - in G@@ er@@ many , a@@ m@@ on@@ g a number of other countries , my own in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded - then I pre@@ d@@ ic@@ t than something si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en where the transport policy is concerned , and the environmental problems we are now ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing , ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of the f@@ a@@ il@@ ed c@@ li@@ ma@@ te con@@ f@@ er@@ ences , et@@ c .
I am also ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated at the fact that al@@ most everyone still h@@ i@@ d@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d all k@@ in@@ ds of issues to do with our su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed in@@ ability to establish the c@@ o@@ s@@ t s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ally .
we can do it for accidents all right , but not for other things .
I have a problem with this .
again , there is more than enough d@@ at@@ a for us to make he@@ ad@@ way with this whole a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r .
I therefore hope con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures - of the kind , in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , that first fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ red in Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos; s report and a number of which we quite d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly r@@ e @-@ su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted - will be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er .
not that we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t everyone to go al@@ on@@ g with them , but the pr@@ im@@ ary in@@ t@@ en@@ tion is to s@@ en@@ d out a si@@ g@@ n@@ al to the Commission to at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate , if not h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise , these measures - which will in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de a k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ r@@ e le@@ v@@ y and so on - at European level , so as to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d a situation where one country does take action and another does not .
one country will say that n@@ one of this is s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ally fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble , while another will simply get on with implementation , which is a most c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous state of a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s of course .
that is why we have put a number of su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts back on the ta@@ ble and we hope that some of them make it through .
a@@ part from that , I wish everyone l@@ u@@ c@@ k at the d@@ ra@@ f@@ ting stage .
Mr President , I would also like to j@@ o@@ in Members in rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ ing the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able work that has been carried out by the rapporteur and the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , who have in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated many amendments .
I would , however , like to come back to some points I think wor@@ th em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ing to make the report as effective as possible .
first of all , I feel it is im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to point out that the main th@@ ing is to promote the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability of transport , which is a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l , long @-@ term m@@ e@@ a@@ sure n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t our environment and a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion .
on this issue , I do not believe that it is possible to consider f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport on the same level as p@@ ri@@ va@@ te transport .
the for@@ m@@ er is currently w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red as an economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as the la@@ t@@ ter al@@ l@@ o@@ ws freedom of movement , a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l freedom .
we must ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the quality c@@ h@@ o@@ ice r@@ an@@ ge in the v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of transport available .
that should then d@@ ri@@ ve us to consider the need to improve services of general interest in these se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s that are so important to the people and to the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
secondly , I also believe that we need to p@@ in@@ point priority issues .
we cannot consider ra@@ i@@ l u@@ s@@ ers and road u@@ s@@ ers on the same level either .
this means that the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of road use is ad@@ ded to the to@@ ta@@ l of costs b@@ or@@ n@@ e by society such as environmental costs and the costs of accidents .
all st@@ u@@ di@@ es have clearly s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n this .
we must give this f@@ ac@@ to@@ r priority in terms of Community action .
to su@@ m up , with regard to ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing , I believe that this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing should not further increase costs , particularly those pa@@ i@@ d by u@@ s@@ ers .
any infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing system , like the one proposed in my group &apos; s amendment , should improve the services of general interest , which some transport services provide , in order to o@@ f@@ f@@ er all citizens e@@ qu@@ al access to high @-@ quality , sa@@ f@@ e and a@@ f@@ for@@ d@@ able services .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to start by th@@ an@@ king the rapporteur both for the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of work he has done and also , in particular , for his w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to accept the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons , amendments and proposals of all the re@@ st of the committee , to the point that I feel this report can be said to be a h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly c@@ ol@@ le@@ g@@ i@@ al report pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed by the committee as a whole .
mo@@ re@@ over , the current situation is clear - the W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er and the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ ted it per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly : there is a great problem because of the environmental and social costs we have to be@@ a@@ r and because of the at@@ ta@@ c@@ k on free trade that the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in ta@@ x@@ es and ta@@ x@@ ation systems in our countries im@@ p@@ o@@ ses upon their economic systems .
with this report , therefore , we have i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied a possible situation , a road to take , and it is now up to the Commission to take it .
I rec@@ all the b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks that we all share : greater pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity with regard to use in the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of costs , att@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s to social costs , but also protection of dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ged g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical areas and se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s of the population , &quot; y@@ es &quot; to environmental su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability but , at the same time , re@@ con@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion of the right to mo@@ bility as a uni@@ ver@@ sa@@ l right .
the only re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation I would v@@ en@@ ture to make , Commissioner , is that all this is good , particularly the sh@@ i@@ f@@ t to the &quot; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle , but with the res@@ er@@ va@@ tion that we cannot allow this principle to pen@@ al@@ ise the citizens or b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses .
sh@@ i@@ f@@ ting to the &quot; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle means en@@ ter@@ ing into the ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ e of pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing a s@@ er@@ v@@ ice for which a pr@@ ice is set , and we must therefore guarantee the citizens and b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses what they want and what they are w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to pa@@ y for : n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y quality .
quality in the context of transport , in my opinion , means above all safety , acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ bility and co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
if we can provide this , then , at the same time , we will have over@@ come our present di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es and set the w@@ h@@ e@@ el@@ s in motion for a new per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive for the future .
Mr President , I would like to ad@@ d to the p@@ ra@@ ise for Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , the rapporteur , because this is an extremely difficult subject and there are very con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ting op@@ in@@ i@@ ons .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , he has had many amendments to work through .
when all is said and done , I believe that the te@@ x@@ t p@@ res@@ en@@ ted is clear and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent - no mean fe@@ at .
I think that this contribution by the European Parliament will en@@ able the Commission to make good progress in its su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ent work .
the issue of infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing is perhaps one of the most difficult for the general public to understand , but it is perhaps also the key to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing our objective of a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able freedom of movement , given that the number of people tra@@ v@@ el@@ ling and the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t trans@@ por@@ ted within the Union is ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to increase con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly .
today , we know that road tra@@ v@@ e@@ l pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es the most p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion but that it is also c@@ he@@ ap@@ er in terms of both infrastructure fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing , which is often f@@ un@@ d@@ ed by the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , and in terms of its use .
therefore , if we really wish to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l without c@@ a@@ using so much d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to the environment , we will certainly need to establish ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing ; that is , how the various t@@ y@@ p@@ es of transport pa@@ y the real pr@@ ice of costs .
all the same , I believe that we must be very aware that the ra@@ i@@ l system is not and will not for many years be in a position to com@@ p@@ et@@ e to a great ex@@ t@@ ent with road transport , in particular in terms of f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport or com@@ b@@ in@@ ed transport l@@ in@@ ks , which are ur@@ g@@ ent priorities .
there are still con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able infrastructure costs and infrastructure and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment needs , and ra@@ i@@ l com@@ p@@ an@@ ies &apos; prof@@ its do not provide enough to co@@ v@@ er them .
com@@ pa@@ red to road t@@ ol@@ l@@ s , those on the ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s are still too high with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant st@@ ra@@ in on op@@ er@@ ating costs .
the issue of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing is therefore ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l to this matter and if we really wish to improve transport we need to be in a position to ab@@ s@@ or@@ b e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently the external costs of transport ; as mentioned ; in other words , so that road transport actually pa@@ y@@ s for all the costs it en@@ ta@@ il@@ s , as does ra@@ i@@ l transport , and so that the pr@@ ic@@ es ch@@ ar@@ ged acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te@@ ly re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t this transparency regarding costs .
we should not , however , c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e our e@@ y@@ es to one political st@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ling b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k in all this . the political st@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ling b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k is that our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w citizens want to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l .
they believe that they have the right to freedom of movement , something I think we should be@@ a@@ r in mind , and very often they do not di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ate f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t transport and the p@@ ri@@ va@@ te c@@ a@@ r .
this was ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous last S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er .
therefore , on a political level , we must take a c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ous approach , which should be both gra@@ d@@ u@@ al and s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive .
a gra@@ d@@ u@@ al approach means that we cannot im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ex@@ t@@ r@@ a costs on road tra@@ v@@ e@@ l until the ra@@ il@@ way is in a position to take over from it , and for the time being the ra@@ il@@ way is not in any such position .
a s@@ el@@ ec@@ tive approach is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed , because I believe that we have to d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish between p@@ ri@@ va@@ te transport and g@@ o@@ od@@ s transport and that we may also have to gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce ta@@ x@@ es on he@@ a@@ v@@ y g@@ o@@ od@@ s v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es , if we really wish to improve p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion in regions like ou@@ r@@ s , that ac@@ t as c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ roads .
Mr President , we must make it very clear that this is not about the EU ra@@ is@@ ing ta@@ x@@ es or im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing a new tax over and above the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing national ta@@ x@@ es .
it is an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to find a common set of c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , of c@@ o@@ s@@ t com@@ p@@ on@@ ents for the transport infrastructure , and min@@ im@@ is@@ ing su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the EU .
however , it is up to the Member States to set and le@@ v@@ y ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es , al@@ be@@ it in a common framework .
at present , re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e is not e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for transport infrastructure .
quite often , I know in the U@@ K , it is used for b@@ ol@@ st@@ er@@ ing government co@@ f@@ f@@ ers .
I am sure it is the same in other EU Member States .
transport costs should be pa@@ i@@ d by the u@@ se@@ r , but governments should not ch@@ ar@@ ge rural u@@ s@@ ers if there is no public transport , and this report makes that very clear .
this report is about a level pla@@ ying field : not to ch@@ ar@@ ge more but to ch@@ ar@@ ge more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
ha@@ u@@ li@@ ers in the U@@ K com@@ pla@@ in that they are at a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge , and that is t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
non @-@ U@@ K t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s do not pa@@ y U@@ K road tax .
other EU countries &apos; a@@ ver@@ age is t@@ en ti@@ m@@ es l@@ o@@ w@@ er H@@ T@@ V ta@@ x@@ es .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to di@@ e@@ se@@ l f@@ u@@ e@@ l : it is three ti@@ m@@ es more ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve in the U@@ K .
that le@@ ad@@ s to d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tion of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the EU .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the U@@ K E@@ u@@ ro@@ sc@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ c@@ s c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ ing this report , they should welcome it because it will do a l@@ o@@ t to help our h@@ ar@@ d @-@ p@@ res@@ sed ha@@ u@@ li@@ ers .
Mr President , I have not yet re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed the point that a number of people w@@ h@@ o@@ m I have he@@ ar@@ d speak this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing have re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed .
as matters st@@ and , infrastructure in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments are made in w@@ a@@ ter@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s and other transport m@@ od@@ es , for example .
no@@ b@@ od@@ y k@@ no@@ ws ex@@ ac@@ tly how much is in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed .
on the other hand , the state rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e from transport , such as road tax .
no@@ b@@ od@@ y k@@ no@@ ws p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y how much this a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts to , but one th@@ ing we do know is that it is not di@@ rec@@ tly r@@ e @-@ in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed in roads and other for@@ m@@ s of infrastructure .
this report ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses the b@@ al@@ ance between re@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e and ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e ; in@@ t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble costs such as environmental and no@@ ise @-@ re@@ la@@ ted costs are also taken into account .
some people also want to rec@@ ou@@ p the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic j@@ a@@ m@@ s from those who get st@@ u@@ c@@ k in them , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the &apos; p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ter pa@@ y@@ s &apos; principle .
I think this is an excellent principle and I would like to see it ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in full , but not to tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic j@@ a@@ m@@ s .
tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic j@@ a@@ m@@ s are in@@ d@@ ic@@ a@@ ti@@ ve of f@@ a@@ il@@ ed government policy on the infrastructure f@@ r@@ on@@ t , which is why the government itself , certainly in the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , must be re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as the p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ter .
this report t@@ al@@ ks about b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ing the pa@@ y@@ ment of social costs between the different m@@ od@@ es of transport .
let us take a moment to consider the tra@@ in in this li@@ g@@ h@@ t .
road transport always se@@ em@@ ed to cause far more p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion than ra@@ i@@ l transport .
following re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , this se@@ em@@ s not to be the case .
now the question is : what are we actually se@@ e@@ king to achieve by making social costs v@@ is@@ i@@ ble in this way ?
do we really want an objective , ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the costs of the transport m@@ od@@ es , or , if certain results do not m@@ e@@ e@@ t with our ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l , for example if ra@@ i@@ l transport b@@ ec@@ om@@ es pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ el@@ y ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve as a result , will we end up making a political as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment ?
we want people to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l by tra@@ in and so it must be made more a@@ f@@ for@@ d@@ able .
that is fin@@ e by me , but not by using this m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d .
we are not going to tax w@@ a@@ ter and road transport he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y first on the basis of the th@@ e@@ o@@ re@@ ti@@ c@@ al mo@@ de@@ l , and then s@@ par@@ e the tra@@ in .
road and pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ er tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic already pa@@ y far more than their share in terms of social costs .
so either we st@@ o@@ p be@@ ating about the b@@ u@@ s@@ h , so that everyone k@@ no@@ ws what they can be for or against , or we op@@ er@@ ate a well @-@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al system with gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es for the dis@@ ab@@ led , people who li@@ ve in rural areas and have no c@@ h@@ o@@ ic@@ es , and the com@@ p@@ et@@ ition position of the Union .
Commissioner , I must say , this is a h@@ or@@ n@@ e@@ t &apos; s n@@ est you have g@@ o@@ t y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f into .
why should a system of this kind only be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to the transport sector ?
why should it not be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to al@@ u@@ min@@ i@@ u@@ m f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies , h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ als , s@@ k@@ i r@@ un@@ s , h@@ y@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts , par@@ li@@ a@@ ment b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s and high @-@ v@@ ol@@ ta@@ ge n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks too ?
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , but I would like to point out that he d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions not for his p@@ s@@ y@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity to un@@ ite w@@ il@@ l@@ s , but for having in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded certain f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s in the report which allow us all to be un@@ ited .
I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t two of these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s , the on@@ es which le@@ a@@ d me to support the re@@ st of his proposals .
the first is that the report , &quot; st@@ res@@ ses that such m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y needs a gra@@ d@@ u@@ al and st@@ e@@ p @-@ w@@ ise implementation based on transparency and su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent information . &quot;
the second f@@ ac@@ to@@ r which le@@ ad@@ s me to ap@@ pro@@ ve this report is the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity issue , because , un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos; s report makes it ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly clear - he has said this with com@@ p@@ le@@ te transparency - that there is going to be an increase in the c@@ o@@ s@@ t for u@@ s@@ ers , as the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of funding by the States is going to be pa@@ s@@ sed on to u@@ s@@ ers .
we cannot i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ e that fact .
we therefore need this gra@@ d@@ u@@ al implementation , which se@@ em@@ s to me to be ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly essential because , when we speak of ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ s in relation to internal and external costs , in the f@@ ul@@ l@@ est s@@ en@@ se of the wor@@ d , which is currently difficult to defin@@ e , we are t@@ al@@ king about an increase in c@@ o@@ s@@ t for the u@@ se@@ r .
therefore , in fact , we are t@@ al@@ king about f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ ing ra@@ i@@ l transport .
I believe that this is one of the b@@ a@@ se@@ s which j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the im@@ position of ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ s .
the fact is that road transport - a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ es - have a clear and very serious environmental impact , so much so that they al@@ one are re@@ pla@@ c@@ ing , and therefore in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing , what all the other in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s are sa@@ v@@ ing in terms of g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se g@@ a@@ se@@ s .
the time has therefore come to ta@@ me the a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ e .
no@@ b@@ od@@ y w@@ an@@ ts to be de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed of an a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ e , but we must ta@@ me it .
on the one hand , by means of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , a@@ im@@ ed at re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion . on the other hand , however , we must also in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence d@@ ri@@ ver@@ s .
it is clear that these ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ s are going to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce an increase in the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to u@@ s@@ ers so that they might consider the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of using public transport and the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of making more ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al use of the ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s - both for g@@ o@@ od@@ s and for pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ er transport .
I believe that this is the key f@@ ac@@ to@@ r , which t@@ r@@ u@@ ly j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ ies the Commission and Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a &apos; s proposed im@@ position of ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ s .
that is why we are going to support h@@ i@@ m but , of course , this gra@@ d@@ u@@ al implementation se@@ em@@ s to me to be f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l to the con@@ su@@ m@@ er being able to accept and take this process on bo@@ ar@@ d .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to congratulate Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a on his h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of this difficult d@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ er .
it is an in@@ t@@ ra@@ c@@ ta@@ ble subject and the fact that there are 1@@ 2@@ 6 amendments s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s how di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed opinion is , but at least it has led to a more re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c position .
b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king , I would , in th@@ e@@ or@@ y , agree with the report that we need to have a more acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te idea of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ al social costs of transport .
however , in practice , it would ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r that such measures would be att@@ en@@ ded by u@@ n@@ e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ted and un@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ded effects .
that is why a great deal more re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch will need to be done before the pr@@ ic@@ es can be c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ted cor@@ rec@@ tly .
I do not see e@@ y@@ e to e@@ y@@ e with Mr B@@ ou@@ w@@ m@@ an on that sc@@ or@@ e .
one of the un@@ de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble effects is that the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to roads will r@@ ise by a re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y small a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t , ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 1@@ 0 to 1@@ 5 % . this con@@ tra@@ st@@ s with the 1@@ 00 % r@@ ise in the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to ra@@ i@@ l , and the 5@@ 0 % r@@ ise in the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to internal n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ ation .
the de@@ si@@ red m@@ od@@ al sh@@ i@@ f@@ t will come under re@@ view again then .
my second concern is that the c@@ o@@ s@@ t to transport will r@@ ise by a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t .
that would be to the d@@ et@@ r@@ im@@ ent of Europe &apos; s economic position .
finally , I do not go al@@ on@@ g with the rapporteur &apos; s proposal to de@@ part from the &apos; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s &apos; principle , in that he w@@ an@@ ts to g@@ r@@ an@@ t ex@@ t@@ r@@ a assistance to re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e regions , for example .
firstly we must consider in real terms whether this would le@@ a@@ d to d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tion of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition and an increase in the to@@ ta@@ l costs .
I am against c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ es for the same reason .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , th@@ an@@ ks to the C@@ o@@ st@@ a report the discussion about a common framework for le@@ v@@ ying transport infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es has g@@ o@@ t going again .
if we want a s@@ in@@ g@@ le market that wor@@ ks , we need a transport system that wor@@ ks , in which the conditions of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition are e@@ qu@@ al or at least com@@ par@@ able for all those involved in transport .
the gra@@ d@@ u@@ al h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of transport infrastructure ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es is the most important st@@ e@@ p towards that .
the way we agree to c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ late costs is certainly important to the ma@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ance , op@@ er@@ ation and new development of infrastructure whether full costs or mar@@ g@@ in@@ al costs , social mar@@ g@@ in@@ al costs or social n@@ e@@ t costs .
but al@@ most more important in terms of e@@ qu@@ al opportunities in com@@ p@@ et@@ ition is that we re@@ ac@@ h agreement , and do so as f@@ a@@ st as possible .
yet we must re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er one th@@ ing . if we want to see f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between the various transport m@@ od@@ es too then we need to go on dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the implementation of the external costs .
to pre@@ v@@ ent that discussion also means pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of the various m@@ od@@ es of transport and is therefore no more than l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ ying , or a policy of l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ ying for the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o .
I will fi@@ g@@ h@@ t out the question of who is h@@ ol@@ ding s@@ ha@@ m de@@ b@@ a@@ tes in this House with Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i el@@ se@@ where ; at present I only have two min@@ u@@ tes &apos; s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king time .
for he@@ a@@ v@@ y g@@ o@@ od@@ s transport we ur@@ g@@ ently need a Europe @-@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e , k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ r@@ e @-@ based he@@ a@@ v@@ y g@@ o@@ od@@ s ch@@ ar@@ ge ; here we could also en@@ v@@ is@@ age re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the mo@@ to@@ r v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le ta@@ x@@ es .
many transport as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations are themselves se@@ e@@ ing it that way now .
only if we ch@@ ar@@ ge transport costs on the &quot; u@@ se@@ r pa@@ y@@ s &quot; principle can we ob@@ ta@@ in a market @-@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing crisis in g@@ o@@ od@@ s transport , for we all know about the next le@@ ap@@ s in g@@ o@@ od@@ s transport costs : r@@ is@@ ing costs as a result of enlargement e@@ a@@ st@@ w@@ ar@@ d , of e @-@ com@@ m@@ er@@ ce , and that is on to@@ p of the ra@@ tes of increase we have seen up to now .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a for his ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ent report and all the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers for par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating in this debate .
I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to be able to say that the Commission has received the report and its con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons with great sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion .
I am aware of the great a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of work and the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous e@@ f@@ for@@ t that the rapporteur , Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , has put in to t@@ r@@ ying to achieve the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st possible con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s , and for which he has been p@@ raised by Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i and other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers .
I would like to say that , with regard to such a s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve and th@@ or@@ n@@ y issue as ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res , it is a great ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement - and I st@@ res@@ s this - to have al@@ most s@@ qu@@ a@@ re@@ d the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ le , because it is really difficult to re@@ ac@@ h a con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s on a proposal such as this .
this report is based on a s@@ er@@ ies of se@@ min@@ ar@@ s with the members of the Commission &apos; s own high level group on ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and on an information con@@ f@@ er@@ ence on best practice in ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
by this I mean that this is a well @-@ wor@@ k@@ ed , well @-@ in@@ for@@ m@@ ed and st@@ u@@ di@@ ed d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment and we o@@ we that firstly to Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a and to the other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who have s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n their great interest in such a th@@ or@@ n@@ y and difficult issue .
the report is therefore well @-@ wor@@ k@@ ed and makes a s@@ ol@@ i@@ d contribution to the under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of the policy of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res as well as its ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation , a key issue in the or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of transport policy and in making progress with a policy which gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es la@@ st@@ ing transport and mo@@ bility for the future and in de@@ al@@ ing in a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al way with the ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary d@@ em@@ and to which we are going to have to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion in the years to come .
the report also co@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ es with the Commission &apos; s policy on ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for transport in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
the Commission b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ es that the lack of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation in f@@ is@@ c@@ al policies , the lack of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation in Member States &apos; ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing , h@@ in@@ d@@ ers the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of transport op@@ er@@ ations and re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ts the development of the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market and economic in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion .
w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the different means of transport , it im@@ p@@ o@@ ses real costs on European com@@ p@@ an@@ ies and on society in general .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , the Commission has proposed the gra@@ d@@ u@@ al implementation - and I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y that Mr I@@ z@@ qu@@ i@@ er@@ do has le@@ f@@ t , because he has not seen that not only has Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted that amendment , but that the Commission is ha@@ p@@ p@@ y that he has - of a h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised framework for ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res in the European Union which is ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ able to all means of transport .
the Commission &apos; s policy of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a framework for the reform of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ es and ta@@ x@@ es on transport , with a view to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ting environmental costs , infrastructure costs and the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of man@@ ag@@ ing d@@ em@@ and for transport .
progress has been made , as in the case of the ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l in December of the measures on ra@@ il@@ way in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res through the con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation procedure .
a great deal , however , re@@ ma@@ in@@ s to be done .
I am therefore p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to be able to as@@ sure Parliament that the concerns h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted in the report in relation to ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res will be taken fully into account in the next Commission W@@ h@@ ite P@@ ap@@ er on the common transport policy , which I re@@ f@@ er@@ red to pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly and which , although s@@ om@@ e@@ what la@@ ter than the d@@ a@@ tes in@@ it@@ i@@ ally en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ ed , will en@@ able us to make progress in s@@ ol@@ v@@ ing one the most com@@ p@@ le@@ x problems of that transport policy : ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res .
all of that will be possible th@@ an@@ ks to the ma@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ent work of the Members of this Parliament and Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a in particular .
thank you very much , Mrs de P@@ al@@ ac@@ i@@ o .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w at 1@@ 2 no@@ on .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was c@@ l@@ o@@ sed at 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 4@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l of the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes of the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ it@@ ting
y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day &apos; s M@@ in@@ u@@ tes have been d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted .
are there any com@@ ments ?
Mr President , I must ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ise , because this is not a com@@ ment on y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day &apos; s M@@ in@@ u@@ tes , but on the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes from the day before y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day .
unfortunately , I no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed too late that my n@@ a@@ me was not on the att@@ en@@ d@@ ance re@@ g@@ is@@ ter .
however , I was here the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e day and to@@ o@@ k part in all the r@@ ol@@ l @-@ call v@@ o@@ tes and other v@@ o@@ tes .
I would be gra@@ te@@ ful if this could therefore be cor@@ rec@@ ted .
Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t , of course the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes will be cor@@ rec@@ ted to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t the t@@ r@@ u@@ e situation .
Mr President , Mrs M@@ a@@ es is not present in the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er .
she is att@@ en@@ ding a B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u meeting of our group .
but I no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed that she is not l@@ is@@ ted on y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day &apos; s att@@ en@@ d@@ ance re@@ g@@ is@@ ter .
she was quite defin@@ it@@ el@@ y there .
she s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e in the debate on the Swedish Presidency .
I would ask you to a@@ m@@ en@@ d the att@@ en@@ d@@ ance re@@ g@@ is@@ ter acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
that will certainly be done , Mr S@@ ta@@ es .
( Parliament adopted the M@@ in@@ u@@ tes )
Mr President , on M@@ on@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on , Parliament proposed that the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs should look into the situation of the workers of the European cor@@ por@@ ation , D@@ an@@ one , th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed with the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of 3@@ 000 j@@ o@@ b@@ s in the b@@ is@@ c@@ u@@ it sector , 1@@ 7@@ 00 of which are in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
we do not know when the committee is going to m@@ e@@ e@@ t to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s this matter and it is very ur@@ g@@ ent as the European B@@ o@@ ar@@ d of D@@ an@@ one is going to m@@ e@@ e@@ t t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
I would like to he@@ a@@ r your re@@ p@@ ly on the subject of this in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y and , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , on behalf of m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f and my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w par@@ ty members , I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with these workers . it is ap@@ p@@ al@@ l@@ ing that a cor@@ por@@ ation wor@@ th m@@ il@@ li@@ ons should be able to d@@ ri@@ ve th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of workers throughout Europe into un@@ employment and p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
Mrs L@@ ag@@ u@@ il@@ l@@ er , I would su@@ g@@ g@@ est that , given the importance and the nature of the matter , you speak to the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on E@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ment and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Affairs , Mr R@@ o@@ c@@ ar@@ d .
Mr President , I w@@ on@@ d@@ er if you have seen the ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ve report in today &apos;s ed@@ ition of L@@ e F@@ i@@ g@@ ar@@ o .
it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s an in@@ ter@@ view with a C@@ or@@ si@@ can ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t under the he@@ ad@@ line &apos; A@@ r@@ ma@@ t@@ a cor@@ s@@ a : m@@ en@@ ac@@ e ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ e su@@ r P@@ ar@@ is e@@ t S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g . &apos;
the ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to the A@@ r@@ ma@@ t@@ a C@@ or@@ s@@ a organisation .
the in@@ ter@@ view ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s on the f@@ r@@ on@@ t pa@@ ge of today &apos;s L@@ e F@@ i@@ g@@ ar@@ o and sa@@ y@@ s that the A@@ r@@ ma@@ t@@ a C@@ or@@ s@@ a is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ing di@@ rec@@ t st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es on P@@ ar@@ is and S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g if its d@@ em@@ an@@ ds , which in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the re@@ le@@ a@@ se of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , are not m@@ e@@ t .
the n@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per sa@@ y@@ s that it has pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed the ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le in order to al@@ er@@ t French public opinion to the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate d@@ an@@ g@@ er th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ing it and it also st@@ a@@ tes , by way of information , that em@@ er@@ g@@ ency measures have been taken in P@@ ar@@ is in order to deal with this im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate th@@ re@@ at .
it sa@@ y@@ s nothing about S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
I should like to draw the b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u &apos;s attention to this major issue and ask if it k@@ no@@ ws an@@ y@@ th@@ ing about this and if it has made re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions to the authorities in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g for ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al measures to be taken to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t Parliament because it se@@ em@@ s to me that an@@ y@@ one who so w@@ is@@ h@@ es can en@@ ter the Parliament b@@ u@@ il@@ ding and I fe@@ a@@ r that we may have to deal with h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous and un@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ seen c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es .
Mr M@@ ar@@ in@@ o@@ s , I wish to say , first of all , that I am gra@@ te@@ ful for your information , or at least for the fact that you have s@@ ha@@ red it with us .
there is a fe@@ el@@ ing in Parliament , which I think is s@@ ha@@ red by all Members , that the authorities g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing this in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion take account of and give great priority to the issue of security .
I therefore feel that e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing necessary is either being done or being con@@ si@@ de@@ red in order to guarantee the s@@ mo@@ o@@ t@@ h f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing of this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g or in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s in the most se@@ c@@ ur@@ e conditions possible .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , thank you for your information .
Mr President , as rapporteur in the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y on pre@@ par@@ ations for the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion of the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h R@@ e@@ public , I have a request to make of you .
it has come to our attention that a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the C@@ z@@ ec@@ h Parliament , Mr I@@ v@@ an P@@ il@@ i@@ p , has been ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed in C@@ u@@ b@@ a .
he has e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently been acc@@ used of s@@ p@@ ying .
the t@@ r@@ u@@ th is that he m@@ e@@ t civil rights c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers and that his actions were quite n@@ or@@ ma@@ l for a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of a f@@ re@@ el@@ y el@@ ec@@ ted par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
Mr President , I ur@@ ge you to ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge for a request to be made to the C@@ u@@ b@@ an authorities for Mr P@@ il@@ i@@ p and those ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ ying h@@ i@@ m to be re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly , because the C@@ u@@ b@@ an re@@ g@@ im@@ e does not have any m@@ or@@ al g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for g@@ i@@ v@@ ing l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ons in democracy to members of a f@@ re@@ el@@ y el@@ ec@@ ted par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
I have all the more reason for as@@ king you this given that in A@@ p@@ ri@@ l this year a meeting of the In@@ ter @-@ P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y Union is due to take place in C@@ u@@ b@@ a .
how can one p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy h@@ ol@@ ding a meeting of this kind in a country where members of par@@ li@@ a@@ ment are ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed if they t@@ al@@ k to civil rights c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers ?
thank you very much , Mr S@@ ch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ er , I shall con@@ v@@ e@@ y your information and your concern - which , I think we all share - to Mrs F@@ on@@ ta@@ ine , the President of this Parliament , who will certainly state Parliament &apos; s position on this issue .
Mr President , I r@@ ise to request that the th@@ re@@ at@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m against this House be taken s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly and that the S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al draw up a plan to actually guarantee the safety of this House .
I shall re@@ p@@ e@@ at what I said a few m@@ om@@ ents ago : I believe that Parliament ta@@ k@@ es security issues extremely s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , and we all feel that the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in which we work and the f@@ a@@ me of Parliament itself make it a ta@@ r@@ get .
the com@@ p@@ et@@ ent authorities are therefore very att@@ en@@ tive to this issue and to l@@ o@@ o@@ king at measures to improve the situation so that we can work sa@@ f@@ el@@ y and in peace .
Mr President , also on the question of the security of the House , you will rec@@ all that on 2@@ 8 N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 , the Turkish F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Minister ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y of this House and he was in@@ ter@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ ted by d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s .
this was a cause for great concern .
at the time , we d@@ re@@ w the attention of the President to this matter and she pr@@ om@@ ised she would look into it and find out what the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es were , how the d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s had g@@ o@@ t into Parliament , and take appropriate st@@ e@@ p@@ s to ensure that such things did not ha@@ p@@ p@@ en again .
in the context of what we have been dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing , the security of this House , I w@@ on@@ d@@ er if you would follow this up and see what st@@ e@@ p@@ s have been taken to improve security and report on that particular in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent last N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er .
Mr V@@ an O@@ r@@ d@@ en , the President of Parliament and the B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u fully no@@ te your com@@ ment and you will s@@ o@@ on have a res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the important issue that you have raised .
b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the decision @-@ making process
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 ­ 0@@ 3@@ 7@@ 3 / 2000 ) by Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , on behalf of the Committee on W@@ om@@ en &apos; s Rights and E@@ qu@@ al O@@ p@@ por@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ities , on a report from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament and the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Committee on the implementation of Council R@@ ec@@ om@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation 9@@ 6 / 6@@ 9@@ 4 of 2 December 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 on the b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the decision @-@ making process &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ O@@ M ( 2000 ) 1@@ 20 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 2@@ 1@@ 0 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 1@@ 1@@ 7 ( C@@ O@@ S ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you all know , respect for the human rights and f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s of women is a very recent a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ i@@ r .
it was not until the t@@ w@@ en@@ ti@@ et@@ h c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y that women ac@@ qu@@ i@@ red the right to access education , the s@@ c@@ i@@ ences , the ar@@ ts and pa@@ i@@ d employment and that they were finally rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised as be@@ in@@ g@@ s with political rights .
the 2@@ 0@@ th c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y be@@ g@@ an with women fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting for the right to vote .
at the start of the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y , the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds of h@@ al@@ f the population on the pl@@ an@@ e@@ t c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing a f@@ a@@ i@@ r di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations between the se@@ x@@ es in all se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s of economic , social , family and political life .
the need for women to be pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted in the decision @-@ making process and for a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c institutions , re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ting the b@@ al@@ ance of the se@@ x@@ es in nature , is a s@@ in@@ e qu@@ a non of democracy and peace and of the cohesion and com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the European Union .
in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to this need and on the basis of d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ en@@ ted proposals by the European n@@ et@@ work of ex@@ per@@ ts which made up the Commission in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 2 , the Council adopted an important re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to the Member States on the b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of men and women in the decision @-@ making process in December 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
we can see from the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by the Member States that little progress has been made over the last three years and that there are h@@ u@@ ge dis@@ c@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es between the Member States .
the most sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y results are in countries which have a long tra@@ d@@ ition of pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing e@@ quality of the se@@ x@@ es , such as Sweden and F@@ in@@ land , where the pro@@ por@@ tion of women in par@@ li@@ a@@ ment and government is over 4@@ 0 % .
Sweden , as you all know , has a c@@ ab@@ in@@ e@@ t of 1@@ 0 m@@ al@@ e and 1@@ 0 f@@ em@@ al@@ e min@@ is@@ ters .
and of course , at the other end of the s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ m , there are countries such as G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and I@@ t@@ al@@ y , where the pro@@ por@@ tion of women is b@@ el@@ o@@ w or ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 1@@ 0 % .
the problem ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly re@@ la@@ tes to the u@@ p@@ per rather than the l@@ o@@ w@@ er ec@@ h@@ el@@ ons of ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion , where the real decisions are taken , where the real power is ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised , where the future of the European Union is pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed and or@@ g@@ an@@ ised .
clearly , c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ e@@ ous measures are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed if the problems and con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tions in@@ h@@ er@@ ited from past co@@ v@@ en@@ an@@ ts between the se@@ x@@ es are to be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed .
we need a new in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al and social framework which re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts all the ch@@ an@@ g@@ es that have taken place since , which gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es e@@ qu@@ al opportunities and di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly and e@@ v@@ en@@ ly between the two se@@ x@@ es , so that any decisions taken re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t the w@@ is@@ h@@ es , v@@ al@@ u@@ es , priorities , interests and ab@@ il@@ ities of both se@@ x@@ es of the human ra@@ ce .
now that women are fully involved in the production process and ou@@ t@@ number men at European uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities , there is no ex@@ c@@ use to ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de them from p@@ ol@@ ic@@ y@@ - and decision @-@ making pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses , n@@ or is it right that women should be@@ a@@ r the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of family ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations and h@@ om@@ e @-@ making al@@ one .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to st@@ u@@ di@@ es and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , men and women working and taking decisions together , a b@@ al@@ ance between the m@@ al@@ e and f@@ em@@ al@@ e , could result in a more b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and f@@ a@@ i@@ re@@ r world .
this b@@ al@@ ance must not , of course , d@@ ro@@ p b@@ el@@ o@@ w 4@@ 0 % for each se@@ x , which is con@@ si@@ de@@ red an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge , especially in S@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ a , where it has been ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed for years now .
what is certain is that , once there is a c@@ r@@ it@@ ical ma@@ s@@ s of women in the decision @-@ making process , priority issues re@@ la@@ ting to the quality of life , such as environmental protection , social policy and w@@ el@@ f@@ are , m@@ ed@@ ical c@@ are , education , the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against d@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ s and tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king in human be@@ in@@ g@@ s and the p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful resolution of con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts will em@@ er@@ ge on the political agenda .
if we are to mo@@ ve in this di@@ rec@@ tion , i@@ .@@ e@@ . if we are to achieve a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of the se@@ x@@ es , we need to adopt specific initiatives and measures , such as re@@ v@@ is@@ ing the par@@ ty political st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture and the procedure for s@@ el@@ ec@@ ting c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes .
the legislation on public funding for political parties should make pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on for greater funding for parties which guarantee a g@@ en@@ d@@ er b@@ al@@ ance within the par@@ ty and for s@@ an@@ c@@ tions for parties which have too few women , as was rec@@ ently dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
governments , especially in countries in which the pro@@ por@@ tion of women is b@@ el@@ o@@ w 3@@ 0 % , should consider how to ad@@ ap@@ t and reform their el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , if quotas in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed are to be effective , they must be l@@ in@@ k@@ ed with other measures re@@ la@@ ting to political parties and the reform of the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al system .
we also need to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le st@@ e@@ re@@ o@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ es by te@@ ac@@ h@@ ing the role of the se@@ x@@ es from an e@@ ar@@ ly age and to c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ te women &apos;s ability to h@@ ol@@ d high o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , how can we st@@ ri@@ ve to c@@ re@@ ate a b@@ al@@ ance between men and women in their working life , both in the p@@ ri@@ va@@ te sector and in public institutions , and both at European and national level ?
we need an effective strategy le@@ ad@@ ing to positive measures .
we need to com@@ b@@ at i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ ance and ou@@ t@@ m@@ od@@ ed c@@ l@@ ic@@ h@@ é@@ s about g@@ en@@ d@@ er r@@ ol@@ es .
our role mo@@ de@@ l should be those con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent women who very e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ y s@@ en@@ i@@ or p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons and who ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
however , they , and this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es e@@ qu@@ ally to men , have to be able to man@@ age their d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic com@@ m@@ it@@ ments just as well as they c@@ op@@ e with the prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al d@@ em@@ an@@ ds pla@@ c@@ ed on them .
on behalf of the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s Party ( C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts ) and European D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts , I would like to congratulate Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u on her report , which in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es many important se@@ c@@ tions , such as the d@@ em@@ and for the role of women to be en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ed or for action to be taken to c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter women &apos;s in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion in management and decision @-@ making bo@@ di@@ es within com@@ p@@ an@@ ies and also , I have to say , in trade uni@@ ons .
the lack of e@@ qu@@ al opportunities in the la@@ b@@ our market needs to be ta@@ c@@ k@@ led by de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing t@@ al@@ ent e@@ ar@@ ly on .
we also support the call for g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ specific st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s in order to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful com@@ par@@ is@@ ons of objectives and ou@@ t@@ comes .
we are in favour of cooperation between the two se@@ x@@ es and therefore want to see women &apos;s concerns , ou@@ t@@ look and ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence making a contribution .
they really do en@@ h@@ an@@ ce a m@@ an &apos; s world .
however , on some points there is not a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the Members of the P@@ P@@ E Group in the Committee on W@@ om@@ en &apos;s Rights and E@@ qu@@ al O@@ p@@ por@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ities .
that is why one h@@ al@@ f voted for the report and the other h@@ al@@ f against - now that is e@@ quality .
the main concerns are co@@ v@@ e@@ red in the f@@ our amendments which I have tabled j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly with A@@ st@@ ri@@ d L@@ ul@@ ling .
Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u has already agreed to one of them : c@@ a@@ re@@ er and family are no longer to be d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed as a d@@ ou@@ ble dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge which women have to f@@ ac@@ e , but rather as a t@@ w@@ o@@ f@@ ol@@ d b@@ ur@@ d@@ en which they have to c@@ op@@ e with and which they can indeed c@@ op@@ e with in practice .
another amendment op@@ p@@ o@@ ses the idea that women need to be tra@@ in@@ ed in areas like public s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king and as@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s if they are to get on in the world .
for one th@@ ing , men also have sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s in these areas and , what is more , these d@@ a@@ y@@ s many women do not w@@ a@@ it to be given financial support to do this .
they are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time .
however , the two most important amendments are about re@@ j@@ ec@@ ting the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of quotas .
we know that there are various systems in the Member States .
some have qu@@ o@@ t@@ a ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents of one kind or another .
some want a kind of ex@@ change system , al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating men and women , and others st@@ i@@ pu@@ late that the parties have to pa@@ y fin@@ es if an a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate pro@@ por@@ tion of women is not gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed in their l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity should come into pla@@ y here .
su@@ re@@ ly it is not right for in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al measures in Member States to be er@@ od@@ ed by Europe through the back d@@ o@@ or .
el@@ se@@ where , governments are called upon to re@@ view the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ al impact of v@@ ar@@ ying el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems .
that is not a j@@ o@@ b for governments - it is a j@@ o@@ b for the parties .
they should look at this and draw up their v@@ o@@ ting l@@ is@@ t@@ s c@@ a@@ re@@ fully with this in mind .
it is their j@@ o@@ b and not one for governments .
we regard these amendments as so important that we have re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed a r@@ ol@@ l @-@ call vote .
if you could give us your support on this , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , your report could well se@@ c@@ ur@@ e an over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity .
an@@ y@@ one de@@ e@@ p@@ ly concerned about e@@ qu@@ al opportunities needs to make sure not only that the over@@ all objectives are right , but that the de@@ ta@@ i@@ l is right too .
the more p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y we wor@@ d this , the greater its c@@ re@@ di@@ bility will be , especially a@@ m@@ on@@ g those who do not have su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in this field , and that will make it all the more l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y that we will se@@ c@@ ur@@ e a b@@ road con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s today .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the policy of the Group of the Party of European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s is for every f@@ em@@ al@@ e c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of the EU to have access to decision @-@ making pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses at local , regional , national and European level .
e@@ qu@@ al participation for women in political and social decision making is not only our le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te right , but a social n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ity .
we do not just en@@ r@@ ic@@ h a m@@ an &apos; s world ; we are par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating in all areas of this su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ d@@ ly m@@ al@@ e world .
as the new m@@ il@@ l@@ en@@ n@@ i@@ u@@ m d@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ s , we are con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e our c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , who I would like to thank s@@ in@@ c@@ e@@ re@@ ly for her per@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ence and h@@ ar@@ d work , in order to mo@@ ve c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the objective of e@@ quality in the d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion of power between men and women .
it has been a long ha@@ u@@ l from the first women &apos;s su@@ f@@ f@@ ra@@ ge , in F@@ in@@ land in 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 4 , to g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed political l@@ is@@ t@@ s in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , and we still have a long way to go before we can take women p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , ma@@ y@@ or@@ s , min@@ is@@ ters and par@@ ty c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s for g@@ r@@ an@@ ted as a part of e@@ ver@@ y@@ d@@ a@@ y life .
the European Union has made con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able progress in this regard .
we have now been able to increase the pro@@ por@@ tion of women in the European Parliament to 3@@ 0 % , and it is , in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , mar@@ k@@ e@@ d@@ ly h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er in the le@@ f@@ t @-@ w@@ ing groups than in the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive and more right @-@ w@@ ing groups .
2@@ 5 % of the Commission is made up of women , and the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e is 2@@ 4@@ .@@ 8 % in the governments of the Member States and 2@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 % in national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments .
I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to be@@ a@@ r g@@ la@@ d ti@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s from my own country .
since the last government res@@ h@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ le in G@@ er@@ many , women now make up 3@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 % of the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al G@@ er@@ m@@ an Government , and this has been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed by my par@@ ty , by my political family .
we are therefore con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent about our own role and can ac@@ t as a d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force for e@@ qu@@ al rights and the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds ar@@ is@@ ing from the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report .
I must call upon the House to support the rapporteur , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the three issues just raised by Mr M@@ an@@ n , and st@@ ic@@ k to the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al te@@ x@@ t p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by the committee .
it would be a mis@@ take to re@@ j@@ ec@@ t quotas , as the parties are being ur@@ g@@ ed to do .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we also su@@ p@@ por@@ ted quotas as ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ated in the report to the W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence on W@@ om@@ en in B@@ e@@ i@@ j@@ ing .
the right th@@ ing is to k@@ e@@ e@@ p all m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s open .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u for a really ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding report .
I think it is ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary in the way it is w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en .
the report clearly em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ es the b@@ i@@ g di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between the Member States , but there is one th@@ ing all the countries have in common : there is no e@@ quality , including in those countries which are f@@ ur@@ th@@ est al@@ on@@ g the road , and here I am th@@ in@@ king , for example , of the S@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ an countries .
in S@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ a , we have made a l@@ o@@ t of progress at par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y level , both on the back and the f@@ r@@ on@@ t b@@ en@@ ch@@ es .
only Sweden and F@@ in@@ land are mentioned , and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k is in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in an a@@ si@@ de .
I should therefore like to say a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of things about D@@ en@@ mar@@ k .
I want to st@@ res@@ s that 9 of the 2@@ 1 min@@ is@@ ters in the D@@ an@@ ish government are women and that both the Minister of E@@ con@@ om@@ ic Affairs and the Minister of F@@ in@@ ance are women .
my own par@@ ty has 4 f@@ em@@ al@@ e min@@ is@@ ters at the moment and one m@@ al@@ e min@@ is@@ ter , p@@ l@@ u@@ s a f@@ em@@ al@@ e le@@ ad@@ er of the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y par@@ ty and a f@@ em@@ al@@ e par@@ ty c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an , and I am the only w@@ om@@ an el@@ ec@@ ted to the European Parliament .
we have for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ te@@ ly n@@ e@@ v@@ er g@@ one in for qu@@ o@@ t@@ a systems for , if that were the case , I believe that men would have be@@ gu@@ n to take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the fact .
in the S@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ an countries too , however , there are very few women in management p@@ o@@ st@@ s , particularly at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est level .
D@@ en@@ mar@@ k has nothing to bo@@ a@@ st about , and n@@ or has Sweden , as far as I can see .
as was p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , the Swedish P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister &apos; s d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation con@@ s@@ is@@ ted only of men .
we clearly have a problem , therefore .
I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally believe that this has to do with the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds made of women in the h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical system .
but that is , of course , something we can dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s .
g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and I@@ C@@ T will pu@@ l@@ l in two different di@@ rec@@ tions .
clearly , I@@ C@@ T has a f@@ l@@ at st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture , and that is to women &apos; s ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation has a con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture , which is to the dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of women who th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly l@@ o@@ s@@ e out in the h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical system .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I want to say that my most important m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge is that cooperation at European level can be extremely u@@ se@@ ful to us , but we must rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that the different countries f@@ ac@@ e very different problems , and quite different initiatives are therefore re@@ qu@@ i@@ red .
we must d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish between those things from which we can all b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it in the Community , for example st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s that can be com@@ pa@@ red , and those areas in which we can clearly only o@@ f@@ f@@ er each other in@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion .
that att@@ it@@ u@@ de will be of no less im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate importance in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with enlargement .
here , we are concerned with countries which may well have the legislation in place , but not the t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , and j@@ o@@ in@@ t aid on our part is really n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in this area .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u on a very good and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve report .
one of its main th@@ em@@ es is the need for an in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted strategy .
if we are to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the very serious im@@ b@@ al@@ ance of re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of men and women , not only in the political s@@ p@@ here but also in decision @-@ making at all levels in society , this is essential .
we should re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that just last year the F@@ in@@ n@@ ish presidency l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed at n@@ ine se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s in the Member States , including national , regional and local par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , the civil s@@ er@@ v@@ ice and the su@@ pre@@ me c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er it l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed it f@@ ou@@ n@@ d women were under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted .
the problems have been rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised for a long time , but progress on s@@ ol@@ v@@ ing them has been s@@ l@@ o@@ w .
we re@@ p@@ e@@ at ourselves con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in these reports , c@@ al@@ l@@ ing for better st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s and training , a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s to encourage more women into p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s in the same way as they have already very often become key pla@@ y@@ ers in their own com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities and local groups , and for measures to make it e@@ a@@ si@@ er for men and to women to b@@ al@@ ance work and family life .
we have to k@@ e@@ e@@ p on sa@@ ying these things because they are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
but , in addition , we need positive action , such as quotas , to make a real di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
this report does not d@@ ic@@ ta@@ te what should be done in in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States , but c@@ al@@ l@@ s upon the governments to look at their own situation and take action to improve the b@@ al@@ ance of women and men , using le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive means , if necessary , as some have already done .
where these measures have been used , they have been su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful , not only in g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing more women el@@ ec@@ ted to Parliament but also in ra@@ is@@ ing a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing good role m@@ od@@ el@@ s for other women - g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s in particular - and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing debate and decision @-@ making all ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
so the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s / European F@@ re@@ e A@@ l@@ li@@ ance will support all the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of the report because it will con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te towards ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing e@@ quality and real democracy .
Mr President , in the Swedish E@@ n@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ op@@ a@@ ed@@ i@@ a of W@@ om@@ en &apos; s H@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y , the en@@ t@@ r@@ y under the he@@ ad@@ ing P@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch@@ y re@@ ad@@ s as f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ ws :
&@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ A social system based on h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical relations between men , st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red so that the decision @-@ making pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses are con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed from the to@@ p down and so that women as a se@@ x are pla@@ c@@ ed in a su@@ b@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate position .
the i@@ d@@ e@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fication is pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed by a system of v@@ al@@ u@@ es de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by m@@ al@@ e th@@ in@@ k@@ ers and f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded on men &apos; s per@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of re@@ al@@ ity .
the ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al basis of this system con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s of a di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of la@@ b@@ our acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to g@@ en@@ d@@ er which , at all levels of the h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ies , as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ s to women the ta@@ s@@ ks which are either un@@ pa@@ i@@ d or more p@@ o@@ or@@ ly pa@@ i@@ d .
one of the pre@@ re@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ es of this is control of women &apos; s se@@ x@@ u@@ al@@ ity and f@@ er@@ ti@@ l@@ ity .
this control in t@@ u@@ r@@ n re@@ qu@@ i@@ res st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence against women , on the one hand , and that women p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ise s@@ el@@ f @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ sion , on the other . &apos;
I would like to come back b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly to the question of how we p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ise s@@ el@@ f @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ sion .
after all , it is not just in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er - it also ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s throughout the various se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s of society - that re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of quotas and , for some reason I cannot f@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ m , have a ter@@ ri@@ ble d@@ re@@ a@@ d of al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ating quotas acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to g@@ en@@ d@@ er .
it is said that women must be ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted on m@@ er@@ it , but I should like to ask the question which , more often than not , em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ers and le@@ ad@@ ing m@@ al@@ e p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans ap@@ par@@ ently f@@ a@@ i@@ l to ask : what m@@ er@@ its are we actually l@@ o@@ o@@ king for ?
after all , we know that , to a large ex@@ t@@ ent , women and men are at present u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ ally re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in society as a whole .
we in the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ al Group of the European United L@@ e@@ f@@ t / N@@ or@@ di@@ c G@@ re@@ en L@@ e@@ f@@ t have no problem w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever with b@@ ac@@ king Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u &apos; s report one h@@ un@@ d@@ red per c@@ ent - on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary .
we are w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for what is called the &apos; k@@ e@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ u@@ p effect &apos; .
we have now been w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for 1@@ 5@@ 0 years , so we do not want to w@@ a@@ it even another two years for something to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , I think that the l@@ o@@ w level of re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of women and , indeed , young people in our par@@ li@@ a@@ ments is the result of a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ f@@ ic@@ it , not a sur@@ p@@ l@@ u@@ s . c@@ l@@ o@@ sed el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t@@ s d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up di@@ rec@@ tly by the parties - as re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed in your report - where it is not even possible to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s a pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence vote , re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the best system for ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of parties , or rather par@@ ty o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als and c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted by parties , be they women or men , in our par@@ li@@ a@@ ments .
on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , I think the s@@ l@@ o@@ w progress in re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of women and young people in our par@@ li@@ a@@ ments is actually due to el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems which pre@@ v@@ ent c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes st@@ an@@ ding against each other and being ch@@ o@@ s@@ en , if only in pr@@ im@@ ary el@@ ec@@ tions , by the people rather than by par@@ ty se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ ri@@ es .
I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t if the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s are particularly te@@ l@@ ling either way - I w@@ on@@ d@@ er what M@@ ar@@ g@@ a@@ re@@ t T@@ ha@@ t@@ ch@@ er or H@@ il@@ ary C@@ l@@ in@@ t@@ on would think of your position on the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity system - but a great deal of d@@ at@@ a and e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence ex@@ is@@ t@@ s to d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite of your th@@ e@@ ses .
another re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation , made in the ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment to your report , is to go so far as to g@@ r@@ an@@ t public fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es to the parties which get the most women into par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
although done with the best of in@@ t@@ en@@ tions , that could be the road to b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y and su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ised re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion and re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in our par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , and it is a road I do not feel we should take .
women &apos; s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion re@@ qu@@ i@@ res more democracy , not less .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l concern must be to establish e@@ qu@@ al opportunities between men and women .
by e@@ qu@@ al opportunities I do not mean le@@ v@@ el@@ ling down , I mean e@@ qu@@ al opportunities for e@@ qu@@ ally qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied women to j@@ o@@ in and progress in the decision @-@ making process and in prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al life , for example by el@@ im@@ in@@ ating di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences in s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies between men and women doing e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent work .
we know from the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s that in n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly all countries at least h@@ al@@ f the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate is made up of women , yet the number of women in decision @-@ making p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons in com@@ p@@ an@@ ies and in public bo@@ di@@ es is re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ b@@ ly l@@ o@@ w .
I regard the pr@@ im@@ e political ta@@ s@@ k as being to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate all b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers to e@@ qu@@ al opportunities .
I have in mind framework conditions that allow women to take responsibility for s@@ ha@@ p@@ ing their own in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al li@@ f@@ e@@ st@@ y@@ le .
a policy that sh@@ i@@ f@@ ts this ta@@ s@@ k to economic pla@@ y@@ ers le@@ ts policy ma@@ k@@ ers o@@ f@@ f the h@@ o@@ o@@ k at the ex@@ pen@@ se of those a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
because the issues involved are social protection , the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of family work , qu@@ al@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ations and s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s , working conditions , working h@@ ou@@ r@@ s and much more be@@ si@@ d@@ es .
it is not a matter of quotas and positive dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation .
if you will for@@ give me , I consider that no@@ tion in itself to be ab@@ sur@@ d .
how can dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation be positive ?
I do not want to have my j@@ o@@ b because I am a w@@ om@@ an , but because I am qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied for it , and I believe that many women feel the same way .
Mr President , Commissioner , this report de@@ als with the b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of men and women in the decision @-@ making process by an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ing the different s@@ it@@ u@@ ations and the lack of participation of women .
we always point out that we women make up h@@ al@@ f of the population and therefore we need greater participation so that women can feel d@@ u@@ ly re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted .
however , it is important to point out that the in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ation of women into public life and the la@@ b@@ our market in pr@@ om@@ in@@ ent p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons is very recent .
and we should also point out that it has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed th@@ an@@ ks to the efforts of women themselves , who have had to over@@ come en@@ or@@ m@@ ous di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
it is a long road al@@ on@@ g which we must continue to make progress , until such time as it is so n@@ or@@ ma@@ l to find women in the p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons which have always been o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ i@@ ed by men that reports such as this are no longer necessary .
women need support , they need more training , more con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ent h@@ ou@@ r@@ s of work and su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent help so that they can re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ e their prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al li@@ v@@ es with their family li@@ v@@ es .
greater participation by women means im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents in democracy and the full rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of their rights on e@@ qu@@ al terms with men .
we agree with the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the report - and we would like to support it to@@ t@@ ally - with the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of the specific re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing fi@@ x@@ ed ob@@ li@@ g@@ at@@ or@@ y quotas , because that could c@@ re@@ ate ad@@ ded problems for women themselves .
we ar@@ gu@@ e for more b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed and h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er @-@ level participation by women than there is at present , particularly in certain countries of the European Union .
the European n@@ et@@ work of e@@ quality com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , which already ex@@ is@@ t@@ s , should be st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed , because it is a very appropriate for@@ u@@ m for the ex@@ change of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences and of good practice .
women must be involved in all areas - not just in the de@@ f@@ ence of their own rights - by par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ating in the resolution of e@@ ver@@ y@@ d@@ a@@ y problems , in the institutions and on com@@ p@@ an@@ y management bo@@ ar@@ ds , in uni@@ ons and in social and cultural organisations .
Mr President , a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful m@@ an once said that h@@ al@@ f of he@@ a@@ v@@ en is b@@ or@@ n@@ e up by women .
but the v@@ o@@ ic@@ es of women are ab@@ s@@ ent when it comes to taking key decisions and se@@ t@@ t@@ ing priorities .
in other words , women , who make up more than h@@ al@@ f of the world &apos; s population , are s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted in political , economic and social areas .
this is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble in a democracy .
no@@ where is the ri@@ f@@ t between de j@@ ur@@ e and de f@@ ac@@ to e@@ quality greater than within the decision @-@ making process .
in order to achieve a b@@ al@@ ance , a con@@ c@@ re@@ te plan of action with a set ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ ble is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
an important part of such a plan is a b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king system .
I am therefore very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u would like to see such a system .
I pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e that the EU &apos; s objectives regarding women in the decision @-@ making process be based on the a@@ ver@@ age of the three most su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful Member States within each field , with an@@ n@@ u@@ al reports from the Member States .
it is ma@@ in@@ ly women who are v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of human rights , such as ra@@ p@@ e , se@@ x@@ u@@ al o@@ f@@ f@@ ences , ab@@ use in the h@@ om@@ e and tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king . women are under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted on the legal and le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive bo@@ di@@ es that j@@ u@@ d@@ ge these c@@ r@@ im@@ es .
this le@@ ad@@ s to the la@@ t@@ ter being given l@@ o@@ w priority . often , the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s are not pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ ted .
the e@@ qu@@ al participation of women in decision @-@ making pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses is not only a matter of d@@ em@@ an@@ ding social j@@ u@@ st@@ ice and democracy , but is also essential if women &apos; s ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence and k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge is to be made the most of .
f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ e women &apos; s decision @-@ making ab@@ il@@ ities is an un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble w@@ a@@ st@@ e .
in Sweden , the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c Party has op@@ ted for the al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of quotas . this comes after many years &apos; st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le to increase the number of women involved in the par@@ ty , which is to say qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied women .
women re@@ p@@ res@@ ent 5@@ 0 per c@@ ent of our Government and 4@@ 4 per c@@ ent of the Swedish Parliament .
the only par@@ ty to have op@@ en@@ ly op@@ p@@ o@@ sed this is the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party . all these women , however , are qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied .
women should not only be@@ a@@ r up h@@ al@@ f of he@@ a@@ v@@ en , they should also accept responsibility for decisions concerning our whole world .
Mr President , I want to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my th@@ an@@ ks for a good report .
it should be ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous to everyone that men and women should have the same opportunities to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in decision @-@ making at all levels , but unfortunately this is not the case .
so what can be done ?
we need greater e@@ quality in the h@@ om@@ e , access to good ch@@ il@@ d c@@ are , s@@ ha@@ red par@@ en@@ ta@@ l responsibility , more en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement within ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al systems to b@@ re@@ a@@ k with tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al g@@ en@@ d@@ er @-@ l@@ in@@ k@@ ed r@@ ol@@ es , and f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble working h@@ ou@@ r@@ s in order to ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ate in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
in addition to this , we also need working m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , industry and trade uni@@ ons which are not based on men &apos; s priorities .
despite the fact that p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es , to a far too great ex@@ t@@ ent , to be a m@@ al@@ e d@@ om@@ a@@ in - in some countries more than in others - the problems are greater still in industry and trade uni@@ on organisations .
this is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble and needs to be the f@@ o@@ c@@ us of more attention .
e@@ quality is not a women &apos; s issue and can only be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed through cooperation between both se@@ x@@ es .
therefore , men must be involved - in a to@@ t@@ ally different way than at present - in working towards e@@ quality .
for in@@ st@@ ance , more men should be ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y involved in working towards e@@ quality within this Parliament .
we need more women in decision @-@ making p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons , but - and this is where I agree with Mrs T@@ he@@ or@@ in - not because they are women but because it is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble for so much s@@ k@@ il@@ l and ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence to go to w@@ a@@ st@@ e .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u &apos; s report pla@@ c@@ es em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on a very important issue : e@@ quality between men and women is extremely p@@ rec@@ ar@@ i@@ ous .
all the fi@@ gu@@ res con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te this and we are making s@@ l@@ o@@ w progress .
that is why , in my view , we have to k@@ e@@ e@@ p em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ ing the issue of decision making and what Europe can do .
Europe has pla@@ y@@ ed a le@@ ad@@ ing role in the st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le for e@@ quality of t@@ re@@ at@@ ment , on the one hand , and e@@ quality in decision making , on the other .
this has been l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , however , be@@ ar@@ ing in mind the con@@ t@@ ents of the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights , where decision making on policy is taken into account only with regard to European Parliament or local el@@ ec@@ tions .
I would just like to te@@ l@@ l you about the French situation , where we have a law which is currently being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted for local el@@ ec@@ tions .
in the b@@ att@@ l@@ es we are w@@ ag@@ ing we dis@@ co@@ v@@ er that every day in the French p@@ res@@ s there are t@@ r@@ u@@ ly f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating ar@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es and de@@ b@@ a@@ tes about the way that the real situation is being trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed , for , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce is the most b@@ ac@@ k@@ w@@ ar@@ d country in Europe in this regard .
today , with the g@@ a@@ me of m@@ u@@ si@@ c@@ al c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s that is being pla@@ y@@ ed by the government , women make up 8 % of the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
that is less than 1@@ 0 % , and that means that the French situation is si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant .
the debate we are having today in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er is one that has been going on con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s@@ ly for two or three years in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
I have just one ar@@ gu@@ ment in de@@ f@@ ence of e@@ quality , not just political e@@ quality but e@@ quality in general .
this ar@@ gu@@ ment , which is both political and p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ical , is this : there is no e@@ quality without re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions , and I ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party to pro@@ ve o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise .
let us not t@@ al@@ k of positive dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation quotas or an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se .
there can be no production in our society without re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions in order to ensure e@@ quality .
this is the only com@@ ment I w@@ an@@ ted to make .
it was our fin@@ al ar@@ gu@@ ment in the b@@ att@@ le for e@@ quality .
that is why I want to ad@@ d very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , by way of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , that there is n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s something important which must be c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied in today &apos; s debate about decision making , which does not co@@ v@@ er the whole problem regarding se@@ x@@ u@@ al e@@ quality , and that is the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence between political and economic matters .
we now know what we have to do in the political ar@@ en@@ a , and I believe we are making progress .
certainly , I am g@@ a@@ in@@ ing a great deal from the current ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds economic e@@ quality in general , and decision making in particular , however , the problem is much more serious and much more ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve .
as my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w m@@ em@@ b@@ er in the Group of the Europe L@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ al , D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at and R@@ e@@ form Party has just mentioned , what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s within tra@@ d@@ es uni@@ ons and in prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al el@@ ec@@ tions has as yet h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly been for@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted .
we have to work on this . it is a much more com@@ p@@ le@@ x issue .
I believe that in future we must no longer t@@ al@@ k about political e@@ quality without fin@@ ding the appropriate m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s . these will not be the same m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s in terms of con@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ ts as those used in the political ar@@ en@@ a .
the means of gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing better re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of women both in industry and at a prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al level must be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
Mr President , when I st@@ ar@@ ted out in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s some th@@ ir@@ ty years ago , and I w@@ ent al@@ on@@ g to the pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary meeting of the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence on W@@ om@@ en , which to@@ o@@ k place in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , I ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed the only f@@ em@@ al@@ e di@@ pl@@ om@@ at our country had at the time .
all the dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k on how we could help women pen@@ et@@ ra@@ te the world of decision making , the world of employment , et@@ c . , were w@@ a@@ st@@ ed on her .
she had re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed her g@@ o@@ al under her own st@@ e@@ am , but she had made so many sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es al@@ on@@ g the way that she had become a w@@ om@@ an w@@ h@@ o@@ m I do not wish other women to take as a role mo@@ de@@ l .
for women who made their way into p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y , et@@ c@@ . many years ago , are women who had to make h@@ u@@ ge sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
what we want is to give women the opportunity to find their n@@ ic@@ he in decision making , p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s and the world of employment in a n@@ or@@ ma@@ l way , with some help from society .
we might well question how this should be done .
how can we help women ?
for years , we have been l@@ o@@ o@@ king for st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es for a society which pa@@ y@@ s li@@ p s@@ er@@ v@@ ice to the idea that women must be given all opportunities , but which has so little in@@ put when it comes to se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up b@@ in@@ ding , effective st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es in order to achieve this .
the few st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es which were set up have always been st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es with ta@@ r@@ get fi@@ gu@@ res or quotas - call them what you will .
the ta@@ r@@ get fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e system or the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system is not a system which only ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to women .
in my country , where the two l@@ an@@ gu@@ age regions , D@@ u@@ t@@ ch and French , should co@@ ex@@ is@@ t in h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y , we also apply quotas for l@@ an@@ gu@@ age pro@@ por@@ tions .
the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system , therefore , is not a system s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ed for women .
people now ac@@ t as if it were a system which only ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to women , but it is a system that is used in many areas of society .
it is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y that it will also be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to other areas in future .
I have qu@@ o@@ ted one example .
I cannot understand , therefore , those who are so an@@ x@@ i@@ ous about this system .
each time , I w@@ on@@ d@@ er whether the reason why they are against the qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system is because , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly , their a@@ i@@ m is to pre@@ v@@ ent women from j@@ o@@ in@@ ing at all , or whether it is g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y because they have f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions .
I am in favour of a qu@@ o@@ t@@ a system .
this view is not s@@ ha@@ red by the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of my group , but is by a number of others .
I am an ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ate of the system .
I su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed it in B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m as the only country in Europe , and it was s@@ o@@ on c@@ op@@ i@@ ed in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce .
I believe it is one of the few p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al op@@ tions which ex@@ is@@ t at the moment .
I support the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report .
con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions .
Mr President , Commissioner , despite the fact that the number of women in education , employment and p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s has in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d and con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to increase , it is clear that there are still great problems and in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities in the social se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s under discussion .
those who t@@ r@@ u@@ st in the idea that , th@@ an@@ ks to o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al e@@ quality and the pa@@ s@@ sa@@ ge of time , s@@ el@@ f @-@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ t@@ or@@ y m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s will work in favour of social b@@ al@@ ance , are mis@@ taken , because they do not ap@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ate the fact that , although e@@ quality before the law and e@@ quality of opportunity are necessary conditions , they are not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent in themselves .
women with the necessary ab@@ il@@ ities often do not make it , but we know many cases of men who at@@ ta@@ in p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons of power without having su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent m@@ er@@ it and they are n@@ e@@ v@@ er called &apos; qu@@ o@@ t@@ a men &apos; .
par@@ ity democracy , which we have been t@@ al@@ king about for many years , is an in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment which is in@@ t@@ en@@ ded , through b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion , to put an end to the mo@@ de@@ l of st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l power which has k@@ e@@ p@@ t women out of the decision @-@ making process .
it is essential to c@@ re@@ ate ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res which promote and m@@ on@@ it@@ or g@@ en@@ d@@ er e@@ quality , and it would also be very h@@ el@@ p@@ ful to re@@ su@@ me the work of the European n@@ et@@ work of ex@@ per@@ ts in the pr@@ om@@ o@@ tion of women in the field of decision @-@ making , which had con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s in the past .
on the other hand - as Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u &apos; s excellent report points out - it is especially important to promote the participation of men and women in all policies at a pro@@ por@@ tion of a min@@ im@@ u@@ m of 4@@ 0 % and a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m of 6@@ 0 % .
in this respect , the systems of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ating men and women on par@@ ty l@@ is@@ t@@ s , pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted in certain political parties , have had un@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ able su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
so the a@@ i@@ m must be the ad@@ op@@ tion of national el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions which provide for the c@@ re@@ ation of par@@ ity l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
the next In@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence must in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de amendments to the Treaty in this respect , so that this objective may be f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed in all the institutions and policies of the Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w women M@@ E@@ P@@ s , if we want to improve our democracy - and that should be our objective here - it is essential that we share res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities and power .
Mr President , the participation of women in decision making is not only a necessary con@@ d@@ ition for the rights and interests of women to be res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted , but also an essential basis for con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ating j@@ u@@ st@@ ice and de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing democracy .
the re@@ al@@ ity of the situation s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that , despite various re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations and res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , this is an area in which major im@@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ es still re@@ main , with a h@@ u@@ ge under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of women in decision @-@ making bo@@ di@@ es , both in economic and social s@@ p@@ he@@ res of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity and in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , and this con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tes to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing im@@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ es and dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ations .
as the rapporteur , w@@ h@@ o@@ m I congratulate on her work , em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ es , it is therefore c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to adopt b@@ ol@@ d measures to promote the participation of women in decision @-@ making , which will also re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e men and women to take on an e@@ qu@@ al share of res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities in public and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te life .
we must also encourage new an@@ t@@ i @-@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es , and that in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es within political parties and public and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tions too , with the a@@ i@@ m of el@@ im@@ in@@ ating the p@@ s@@ y@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical and p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es to the participation of women in decision @-@ making st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and in political life , th@@ e@@ re@@ by pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing re@@ t@@ ro@@ gra@@ de action such as the recent case in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al , where the government ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed the M@@ in@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ y for E@@ quality .
we must change this situation .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I am in favour of a much more b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the decision @-@ making process than is currently the case .
but , un@@ like our rapporteur , I am not con@@ c@@ e@@ ited enough to c@@ la@@ i@@ m that e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing would be different and better if women par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ ted e@@ qu@@ ally in the decision @-@ making process .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , we must not acc@@ use all men ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the bo@@ ar@@ d of having the w@@ r@@ on@@ g in@@ t@@ en@@ tions , for example in relation to de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the rights of children or to the environment , to n@@ a@@ me just a few of the areas mentioned in this context by our rapporteur .
for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ te@@ ly , there are men who are t@@ al@@ en@@ ted and f@@ er@@ v@@ ent su@@ p@@ por@@ ters of the rights and interests that are c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to our he@@ ar@@ ts .
unfortunately , there are also f@@ em@@ al@@ e p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans who just cannot be re@@ li@@ ed upon , even when it comes to pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing more f@@ em@@ al@@ e c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes on the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
in my long political c@@ a@@ re@@ er I can te@@ l@@ l you that it has mo@@ st@@ ly been women who , a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition from me , have t@@ ri@@ ed to put s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ es in my w@@ h@@ e@@ el@@ s .
it must , of course , be said that , despite the good policies of e@@ qu@@ al t@@ re@@ at@@ ment and e@@ qu@@ al opportunities which have been de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed since 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 5 by the Community and , above all , despite the well @-@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ ed re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation of the Council in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 on the b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the decision @-@ making process , progress towards these objectives is s@@ l@@ o@@ w . it is mo@@ v@@ ing at a s@@ n@@ a@@ i@@ l &apos; s or a t@@ or@@ to@@ is@@ e &apos; s pa@@ ce rather than at the s@@ p@@ e@@ ed of a ra@@ c@@ e@@ h@@ or@@ se .
the reason why I voted against this d@@ ra@@ f@@ t resolution on the Commission report in the Committee on W@@ om@@ en &apos; s Rights and E@@ qu@@ al O@@ p@@ por@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ities was because it makes a number of ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ated c@@ la@@ im@@ s and d@@ em@@ an@@ ds , which are c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive for women who want to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate fully in the decision @-@ making process .
I am therefore against the re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to a 4@@ 0 % qu@@ o@@ t@@ a , b@@ el@@ o@@ w which measures would be called for to achieve a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of both g@@ en@@ d@@ ers .
I am of the opinion that such measures are essential now and in the future , ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of the per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge of participation that is ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
I am against the d@@ em@@ and ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed to political parties that they adopt qu@@ o@@ t@@ a systems and , in particular , the z@@ i@@ p@@ per system to set up the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
this z@@ i@@ p@@ per system would be in@@ com@@ pa@@ ti@@ ble with the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al law of my country where , for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ a@@ te@@ ly for me , it is not the political par@@ ty which dec@@ i@@ d@@ es the place of a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate on the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t , but the people , by means of pre@@ f@@ er@@ ence v@@ o@@ tes .
what we need to do is to call on political parties to reform their st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res and procedures with a view to g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing ri@@ d of the di@@ rec@@ t and in@@ di@@ rec@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es to the participation of women , given that Member States could encourage political parties to put a l@@ ar@@ g@@ er number of f@@ em@@ al@@ e c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ tes on their el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t@@ s , by means of financial in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es if necessary .
finally , I find it ab@@ sur@@ d to d@@ em@@ and that only women be tra@@ in@@ ed to take on le@@ ad@@ ing r@@ ol@@ es and to take decisions when many men , who already have such r@@ ol@@ es and j@@ o@@ b@@ s , would g@@ re@@ at@@ ly b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from such training .
my Group has tabled amendments to get ri@@ d of the c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter @-@ pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive d@@ em@@ an@@ ds I have just d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed and I hope that these amendments will be adopted .
I would just like to make one more com@@ ment , which I should not really do before the vote , on the French trans@@ la@@ tion of our amendments .
it is de@@ f@@ ec@@ tive to the ex@@ t@@ ent that these amendments are not only in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble but , as c@@ o @-@ a@@ u@@ th@@ or , I am b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to say that , when I re@@ a@@ d these amendments in French , I feel like a mo@@ th@@ er h@@ en who can no longer find her ch@@ ic@@ ks .
so , Mr President , it is the G@@ er@@ m@@ an te@@ x@@ t which ta@@ k@@ es p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ence .
I ask Members to be aware of this and to be@@ a@@ r it in mind when we vote .
Mr President , Commissioner , as the rapporteur has t@@ ol@@ d us , the number of dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations , res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions and un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ s on e@@ qu@@ al opportunities for men and women is pre@@ t@@ t@@ y res@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ ble .
the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am is ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly the legal basis and it defin@@ es e@@ qu@@ al opportunities between men and women as one of the main priorities of European policy .
however , although there has been some m@@ od@@ est progress , there are still some con@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ u@@ ous sh@@ or@@ t@@ com@@ in@@ g@@ s .
there is a mar@@ k@@ ed im@@ b@@ al@@ ance in the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of men and women in the decision @-@ making process , and there are al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States .
throughout Europe , there are especially few women in le@@ ad@@ ing p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons in ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion and in political decision making .
this means that everyone involved in the economic and social world has to pla@@ y a part if responsibility is to be d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted e@@ v@@ en@@ ly ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the public and p@@ ri@@ va@@ te se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , in b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s and family life .
above all , we need to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that the e@@ qu@@ al opportunities de@@ f@@ ic@@ it in the la@@ b@@ our market is par@@ tly att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ta@@ ble to the l@@ o@@ w pro@@ por@@ tion of women in Europe &apos;s b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses , in its trade uni@@ ons and in its public sector , and par@@ tly att@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ta@@ ble to an in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate social infrastructure , d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ted st@@ e@@ re@@ o@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ es and l@@ o@@ w pa@@ y .
one important area we need to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le is education and training .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st other things , women have to le@@ ar@@ n to la@@ y c@@ la@@ i@@ m to a role in le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p and decision making .
you cannot t@@ al@@ k about b@@ al@@ ance when women account for just 4@@ 0 % of all those involved in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s at European or national level .
quotas are therefore an important in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment if we are to approach this ta@@ r@@ get .
but it is not just a question of in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the number of women , but also about en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ing their role in society and rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ ing the quality of their work .
Party and government st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res need to be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed and where they are f@@ ou@@ n@@ d to be la@@ c@@ king we need to j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly c@@ re@@ ate b@@ in@@ ding re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , such as min@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ es for e@@ qu@@ al opportunities .
greater in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of women in public life needs to be re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ re@@ d using up @-@ to @-@ d@@ ate st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s . this would also clearly d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te that not only have we re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s but that we have also re@@ g@@ res@@ sed in certain areas .
this means that we have to promote e@@ qu@@ al opportunities while , at the same time , de@@ f@@ en@@ ding what has already been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
Mr President , I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s the point of view of working women not only because it is on them , of all women , that the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of social organisation w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ s most he@@ a@@ v@@ il@@ y , but also because the workers &apos; movement can take pr@@ i@@ d@@ e in having been the first to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t for the rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of e@@ quality between men and women .
long before the r@@ ul@@ ing c@@ la@@ s@@ s g@@ a@@ ve women the right to vote , the workers &apos; movement had already , within its own organisation , given le@@ ad@@ ing women the place they d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed .
the f@@ ate of working women is l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s of the working c@@ la@@ s@@ s as a whole .
it is women who are the main v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of in@@ se@@ c@@ ur@@ e employment , en@@ for@@ c@@ ed part @-@ time work and the l@@ o@@ w s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies that are pa@@ i@@ d for such work .
what is un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble is that in@@ se@@ c@@ ur@@ e employment , en@@ for@@ c@@ ed part @-@ time work and l@@ o@@ w s@@ al@@ ar@@ ies are al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to ex@@ is@@ t .
s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es about e@@ quality between men and women will continue to be just so much h@@ o@@ t a@@ i@@ r as long as c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ less working f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies are de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed of a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate h@@ ou@@ s@@ ing and as long as there are not enough public a@@ m@@ en@@ ities , ch@@ il@@ d c@@ are c@@ ent@@ res and n@@ ur@@ s@@ er@@ y sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
in all areas , European in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion policy is no more f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble to the interests of working women than Member State policy .
although I will vote in favour of the report because of the good in@@ t@@ en@@ tions that are st@@ a@@ ted in it , they are still nothing more than good in@@ t@@ en@@ tions .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , even today we cannot as@@ su@@ me that men and women can work al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e each other with e@@ qu@@ al rights in all areas .
that much we all agree upon .
but we also know very well that participation in decision making , be it by men or women , is not an a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c right .
the situation v@@ ar@@ ies w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y , de@@ pen@@ ding on the field , the s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m and the area of responsibility .
this is b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to be a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r when re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing a decision about any m@@ an or w@@ om@@ an se@@ e@@ king to h@@ ol@@ d a particular o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , ap@@ pl@@ ying for a j@@ o@@ b or w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to j@@ o@@ in a particular committee .
however , we can le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly ask if this always ap@@ p@@ li@@ es .
is it not t@@ r@@ u@@ e to say that there are still certain pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ es in our society which m@@ il@@ it@@ ate against a per@@ s@@ on or a se@@ x from the ou@@ t@@ set ?
the m@@ al@@ e n@@ ur@@ s@@ er@@ y sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l te@@ ac@@ her or w@@ om@@ an f@@ ir@@ e @-@ fi@@ g@@ h@@ ter are still ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions to the r@@ u@@ le - as are women who make it to the very to@@ p on management bo@@ ar@@ ds , as di@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ s or on political com@@ m@@ it@@ te@@ es .
as a r@@ u@@ le , this under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion is not because of any lack of s@@ k@@ il@@ l or ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise .
a w@@ om@@ an always has to do something ex@@ t@@ r@@ a to pro@@ ve h@@ er@@ s@@ el@@ f - ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise on its own is not enough , her en@@ ti@@ r@@ e c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es pla@@ y a part .
her children , her family and even the si@@ m@@ p@@ le idea of the w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er se@@ x are b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers to progress .
for far too long we have been te@@ l@@ ling women that they have to be better than the men they are com@@ p@@ et@@ ing against .
for that reason al@@ one we need things like the report before us to w@@ a@@ k@@ e society up from time to time and k@@ e@@ e@@ p up the m@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ m .
I believe that the d@@ ou@@ ble b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of family d@@ u@@ ti@@ es and a c@@ a@@ re@@ er should not be used as g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds for dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation , n@@ or are they a d@@ ou@@ ble dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge as st@@ a@@ ted in R@@ ec@@ it@@ al D@@ . C@@ om@@ b@@ in@@ ing a family and a c@@ a@@ re@@ er in fact d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes a high de@@ g@@ re@@ e of or@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al s@@ k@@ il@@ l and life ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence that should not be un@@ de@@ re@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted , and should be re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as a particularly u@@ se@@ ful s@@ k@@ il@@ l for those in le@@ ad@@ ing p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
it should also be as@@ su@@ m@@ ed that men have the same family com@@ m@@ it@@ ments as women , and all we women de@@ b@@ ating here this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing who have a family would be un@@ able to do all this if our par@@ t@@ n@@ ers were not also com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies as f@@ a@@ th@@ ers .
unfortunately , we have not quite re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed that point yet , and it can still be said that w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as a family pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es support for a m@@ an , it is a m@@ il@@ l@@ st@@ one for a w@@ om@@ an .
so , right from the ou@@ t@@ set , when we are ed@@ u@@ c@@ ating young people , we need to c@@ ou@@ n@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ t these en@@ t@@ r@@ en@@ ch@@ ed social i@@ ma@@ g@@ es .
I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t whether simply d@@ em@@ an@@ ding quotas and per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ g@@ es is the right way to achieve greater re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion , and it should su@@ re@@ ly not be this Parliament &apos; s j@@ o@@ b to call for 4@@ 0 % re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion in all political fi@@ el@@ ds at national and international level .
for a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s to g@@ ro@@ w we need b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed reports and discussion pa@@ per@@ s that em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e e@@ qu@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion , and I therefore ur@@ ge you to support the P@@ P@@ E Group &apos; s amendments .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish , first of all , to congratulate our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Member , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , on the excellent report she has p@@ res@@ en@@ ted to us .
I am not o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing my con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions as a m@@ er@@ e for@@ m@@ al@@ ity .
I am doing so in order to be f@@ a@@ i@@ r and because I believe they are d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed .
this report is not only excellent , but its ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment is a st@@ u@@ d@@ y of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st interest to an@@ y@@ one concerned about e@@ qu@@ al rights for men and women and will un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly s@@ er@@ ve as a se@@ min@@ al re@@ f@@ er@@ ence work for the future .
this pro@@ v@@ es the ec@@ c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity of the B@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u &apos;s decision to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the l@@ en@@ g@@ th of ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ments to one pa@@ ge .
this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er does not pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce pa@@ per by the m@@ et@@ r@@ e .
we are en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s and p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s must have a s@@ ou@@ n@@ d basis .
your report , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , is a fin@@ e example of the importance of the political te@@ x@@ ts d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up in this Parliament .
in my s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h I shall f@@ o@@ c@@ us on the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al system .
this is a c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al problem because it pre@@ d@@ a@@ tes our own participation in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s .
women must be given the opportunity to be el@@ ec@@ ted in order to pro@@ ve what they are c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of .
some el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems make the participation of women even more difficult .
these are , as we have seen , systems that use s@@ in@@ g@@ le n@@ a@@ me l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
this practice has s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed women .
it is not so much the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ ate that is to b@@ la@@ me , but the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res of the parties themselves , which c@@ re@@ ate en@@ or@@ m@@ ous di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es by means which are often less than legal .
th@@ us , although there is a mo@@ ve towards at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to change this system of s@@ in@@ g@@ le n@@ a@@ me el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al l@@ is@@ t@@ s , with procedures being c@@ re@@ ated , in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce for example , to set the b@@ al@@ ance right and to achieve a qu@@ o@@ t@@ a of 5@@ 0 % for both se@@ x@@ es , the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e government has an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed the c@@ re@@ ation of a new el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al law that will par@@ ti@@ ally re@@ place the pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al system with the s@@ in@@ g@@ le n@@ a@@ me system .
this is an initiative that g@@ i@@ v@@ es great cause for concern and we must be aware that , in this case , this will clearly dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate against women who wish to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u on her excellent p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of the situation in Europe as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds e@@ quality of the se@@ x@@ es and on her or@@ de@@ red approach to proposals and s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions .
I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y that the s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ m@@ an for the P@@ P@@ E who ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st op@@ position to the report has le@@ f@@ t because the debate would have been h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing .
allow me to start by making a political ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tion .
the t@@ it@@ le of the report : &quot; the b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of women and men in the decision @-@ making process &quot; has a d@@ u@@ al m@@ e@@ an@@ ing .
the decision @-@ making process ta@@ k@@ es place in the c@@ ent@@ res of power ; but it also means b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation in the most important decision @-@ making process for the future , which ta@@ k@@ es place in the family .
so it re@@ f@@ ers to both se@@ x@@ es and the n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers of women in decision @-@ making c@@ ent@@ res cannot be in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d un@@ less the pro@@ por@@ tion of time which men s@@ pen@@ d on family matters is also in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d .
this a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally means that if we want to achieve the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red ta@@ r@@ get , we need to make ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to the family , society , the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y and the cultural i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity which we have had for c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ri@@ es .
the debate re@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ed l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d whether or not quotas , i@@ .@@ e@@ . a qu@@ an@@ t@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ ve commitment on participation , was an acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
I would say , from a p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ical point of view , that a set of n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers or rules can n@@ e@@ v@@ er change a social fact of life .
however , h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that rules and ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s can bring about change , especially if they are ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed by a set of policies .
so what we need to do , and this is clearly ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u &apos;s report , is to implement three t@@ y@@ p@@ es of policy si@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ou@@ s@@ ly if we are to achieve this important objective , which concerns democracy in our s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es .
the first t@@ y@@ p@@ e of policy is ma@@ in@@ st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ ing e@@ qu@@ al opportunities in the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y and employment , in social systems and social protection and in education systems and the cultural i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity of our s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es .
the second t@@ y@@ p@@ e of policy concerns specific measures and specific positive action to support the policy of participation in the decision @-@ making process .
these measures re@@ la@@ te to el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems , where it has been pro@@ v@@ en that there is a c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cor@@ relation between el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al systems and the participation of women , they re@@ la@@ te to the need for con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ous st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s which th@@ ro@@ w the f@@ ac@@ ts into re@@ li@@ e@@ f , they re@@ la@@ te , of course to political parties and their internal political com@@ m@@ it@@ ments and they re@@ la@@ te to la@@ ws for positive action .
excellent ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es have been c@@ ited in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , which pro@@ ve that w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ v@@ er quotas have been ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with all the policies which I have just mentioned , they have had positive results .
and we cannot i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ e the fact that the only countries which have made any serious he@@ ad@@ way with the participation of women are the countries which had ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed specific policies .
not always with le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ s on quotas but with political un@@ d@@ er@@ ta@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ s by the political parties and always with specific qu@@ an@@ t@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ ve ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e by re@@ p@@ e@@ ating what the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister of L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g said when the question of whether or not there should be specific ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s for employment in the Member States was being de@@ b@@ ated : &apos; the ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion of political de@@ si@@ r@@ e , the ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion of political in@@ t@@ en@@ tion is not enough .
policy without specific qu@@ an@@ t@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ ve ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s and means is simply l@@ it@@ er@@ a@@ ture . &apos;
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place at no@@ on .
com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of EU f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es
the next it@@ e@@ m is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 4 / 2000 ) by Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , on behalf of the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y , on the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Committee and the Committee of the R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ons : the state of the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the EU f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; C@@ O@@ M ( 1999 ) 4@@ 5@@ 7 - C@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 0@@ 6 / 2000 - 2000 / 2@@ 1@@ 5@@ 9 ( C@@ O@@ S ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ;
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank those who h@@ el@@ p@@ ed to have the debate on this report mo@@ v@@ ed to a time when we can speak about it and vote on it today , in the d@@ a@@ y@@ time .
if the report had been dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed in the e@@ v@@ en@@ ing it would have been in@@ su@@ l@@ ting to the f@@ our million em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es di@@ rec@@ tly or in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly con@@ n@@ ec@@ ted with the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er .
this sector is responsible for a t@@ ent@@ h of the to@@ ta@@ l in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al ou@@ t@@ put for the EU and a third of the world &apos; s f@@ o@@ re@@ st industry production .
all of us present here know the problems that the T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing s@@ it@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ s will p@@ o@@ s@@ e from this day on .
during the debate on the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation it b@@ ec@@ a@@ me ap@@ par@@ ent that the F@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y C@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er is extremely he@@ te@@ ro@@ g@@ en@@ e@@ ous .
P@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ers and pr@@ in@@ t@@ ing wor@@ ks use pa@@ per and other f@@ o@@ re@@ st industry products , but many of them see themselves ma@@ in@@ ly as con@@ t@@ ent pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers .
the con@@ t@@ ent industry &apos; s ou@@ t@@ put is ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised , not just by its use of pa@@ per , but also by the new el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ on@@ ic industry : el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ on@@ ic com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation .
the report ex@@ p@@ res@@ ses the hope that the Commission will also take account of the special fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in these new in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
the report re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ds that the p@@ e@@ at industry should be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in this c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er .
p@@ e@@ at has its own part to pla@@ y in f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , particularly in the N@@ or@@ di@@ c countries and in I@@ re@@ land .
the report does not adopt a position on whether p@@ e@@ at is a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able or a f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l f@@ u@@ e@@ l .
however , as it is pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ ally , these pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ers must have their place in EU ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion .
in the opinion of the rapporteur , the report con@@ ta@@ in@@ s an un@@ necessary number of ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons re@@ la@@ ting to f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y , but it was the wish of the committee , although Parliament has already ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its view on f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y matters in the recent T@@ h@@ om@@ as report .
nothing more needs to be ad@@ ded ; in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , its con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons should be put into effect in the Commission in a more pro@@ ac@@ tive way than is the case at present .
the Commission must also c@@ a@@ re@@ fully st@@ u@@ d@@ y the con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons of Mr P@@ e@@ s@@ ä@@ l@@ ä , s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king on behalf of the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment .
the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the open sector of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , where the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity is con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted in g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ ally com@@ p@@ et@@ ing mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
for that reason , I cannot agree with the amendment proposed by my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , Mrs S@@ ch@@ i@@ er@@ h@@ u@@ b@@ er and Mr R@@ ü@@ b@@ i@@ g , that the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture should be responsible for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y .
ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture in the EU is not acc@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ ed to working in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the conditions of the open sector .
the same problem also re@@ la@@ tes to Mrs A@@ in@@ ar@@ d@@ i &apos; s proposed amendment .
Mrs F@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ ch &apos; s amendment , in my opinion , is taken account of in the te@@ x@@ t adopted by the committee and not least on the basis of her own amendments .
the special needs of the con@@ t@@ ent industry are de@@ al@@ t with th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly in my report , and , for that reason , I do not think this amendment is necessary at this stage .
w@@ o@@ o@@ d is a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able natural res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce .
it has many u@@ se@@ s ; for example , it can be used in the energy industry .
the report acc@@ e@@ p@@ ts the principle acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to which f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y products should be used for the production of energy only at the end of the production c@@ ha@@ in , after which there is no longer any other use for it and it cannot be rec@@ y@@ c@@ led .
Member States are the best ex@@ per@@ ts when it comes to man@@ ag@@ ing their own f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
the m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ation of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s , their importance as s@@ in@@ ks of c@@ ar@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ e , and their p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion for future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations will be best re@@ al@@ is@@ ed though the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , and there is no j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fication for in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the Commission &apos;s p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y matters .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d , it has an important j@@ o@@ b to do , sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
the needs of the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry must also be taken into account in com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al policy .
the European f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er will su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed a@@ m@@ i@@ d fi@@ er@@ ce com@@ p@@ et@@ ition if the rules are the same for all .
if the over @-@ ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation of nature and people is not al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed in Europe , it should not be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed el@@ se@@ where .
the di@@ ver@@ se u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ation of w@@ o@@ o@@ d can improve employment , especially in rural areas , and , con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s also con@@ n@@ ec@@ t with the EU &apos; s employment strategy .
s@@ c@@ i@@ ence and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch must find new u@@ se@@ s for w@@ o@@ o@@ d . for example , using gra@@ s@@ s to make ch@@ em@@ ical pu@@ l@@ p would mean more w@@ o@@ o@@ d for other pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses .
such i@@ d@@ e@@ as must be pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted within a new F@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ work P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch .
w@@ o@@ o@@ d can be used more in con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , as an en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly and he@@ al@@ th@@ y ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al .
and finally : if the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s do well , so will people .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment , I would first like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my w@@ ar@@ m@@ est th@@ an@@ ks to the rapporteur , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , and the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y , for an excellent report and some excellent cooperation .
the Commission has d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted a c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ able com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the state of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry .
this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment has m@@ e@@ ant that f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y matters have been made the subject of very necessary debate in the EU , which , unfortunately , ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s all too ra@@ re@@ ly .
the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment is ma@@ in@@ ly sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with the policies set for@@ th by the Commission and Parliament &apos; s d@@ ra@@ f@@ t report .
we would like to st@@ res@@ s the importance of the whole f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y c@@ ha@@ in in our own opinion , and that in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es the importance of the prof@@ it@@ ability of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and w@@ o@@ o@@ d h@@ ar@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing , which is responsible for the ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al b@@ a@@ se of the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry . su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture in Europe still de@@ pen@@ ds on the family f@@ o@@ re@@ st b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ised by t@@ w@@ el@@ ve million p@@ ri@@ va@@ te f@@ o@@ re@@ st o@@ w@@ n@@ ers and the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities they are en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in .
the H@@ ag@@ u@@ e C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion on W@@ or@@ l@@ d C@@ li@@ ma@@ te C@@ h@@ an@@ ge f@@ a@@ il@@ ed .
we , the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment , have f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed the c@@ li@@ ma@@ te agreement process ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , as , in our opinion , the K@@ y@@ o@@ to P@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l ta@@ k@@ es to@@ t@@ ally in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent account of the importance of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and all w@@ o@@ o@@ d products are a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able c@@ ar@@ b@@ on s@@ in@@ k , and their importance in this respect has to be rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised .
the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of matters of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y in the EU is p@@ o@@ or .
there are more D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ a@@ tes @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al to deal with them but there is a lack of uni@@ for@@ m@@ ity .
per@@ s@@ on@@ n@@ e@@ l resources have been in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d in the area of the environment , but the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture responsible for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y has very few resources to work with , as does that for industry .
for that reason , I support A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 by Mrs S@@ ch@@ i@@ er@@ h@@ u@@ b@@ er on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group .
l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise I want to s@@ how my support for A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 3 and 4 in particular , which are from the opinion by the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and R@@ u@@ ra@@ l D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment .
our committee ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed them by general con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I start by dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ing an interest , or two interests , in this issue .
I have an interest in a f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s in N@@ e@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , in@@ h@@ er@@ ited from my f@@ a@@ th@@ er , so that g@@ i@@ v@@ es me a p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al interest .
more rec@@ ently I v@@ is@@ ited F@@ in@@ land to see the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry at work as the gu@@ est of C@@ E@@ P@@ I , the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ ation of European P@@ ap@@ er In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
so you see the st@@ r@@ on@@ g F@@ in@@ n@@ ish th@@ em@@ e in this report con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es even with me .
can I welcome this com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation and ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my p@@ le@@ a@@ sure at its em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the importance of this industry .
like the rapporteur and other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es I rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y is a very important industry , important for the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y and important for the environment .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
in itself it has made quite a contribution towards the con@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion of pa@@ per and this is to be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed , even if our c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es on the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y had to make it a little b@@ it longer than he would wish .
better to say too much about f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y than too little .
I no@@ te with interest his re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to te@@ le@@ com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ations and the ch@@ an@@ g@@ es in the s@@ ha@@ p@@ e of the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation industry .
I ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to believe that despite all these w@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ ful aspects of m@@ od@@ er@@ n te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , we will continue to need pa@@ per for our re@@ ad@@ ing , because it is the m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m that most people are still com@@ for@@ ta@@ ble with and I certainly am .
also , of course , we shall continue to need ti@@ m@@ b@@ er for all the other u@@ se@@ s to which it is put , such as in con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion and other possible new u@@ se@@ s .
the rapporteur and the Committee on A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture draw attention to the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch into new u@@ se@@ s of ti@@ m@@ b@@ er .
can I s@@ ou@@ n@@ d one no@@ te of w@@ ar@@ n@@ ing .
it is a little un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c to ask the Commission to ensure that pa@@ per pr@@ ic@@ es in Europe are com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve .
I think that might be st@@ re@@ t@@ ch@@ ing the Commissioner &apos;s p@@ o@@ w@@ ers a little b@@ it .
I see he is s@@ m@@ il@@ ing so perhaps he ag@@ re@@ es with me .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the Commission has to ensure that f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition ta@@ k@@ es place .
that is the key issue here , rather than t@@ r@@ ying to favour our industry .
this is a v@@ al@@ u@@ able , su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able industry , very important to the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y of Europe and to our environment , and this is a very ti@@ m@@ el@@ y report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his res@@ ol@@ u@@ te approach to the work he has done , which is so t@@ y@@ p@@ ical of h@@ i@@ m , on this report , which is a b@@ road por@@ tra@@ y@@ al of human life in g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing f@@ o@@ re@@ st st@@ o@@ c@@ k country .
one third of our land area is co@@ v@@ e@@ red in f@@ o@@ re@@ st , and if you in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de our n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s to the e@@ a@@ st in the p@@ ic@@ ture , there is still more f@@ o@@ re@@ st .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based industry actually em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ s two and a h@@ al@@ f million people , which is no in@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant matter , and , as we know , ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for a t@@ ent@@ h of in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al ou@@ t@@ put .
when we c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ late the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of c@@ ar@@ b@@ on that is se@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ red in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s I think we also have to take into account the st@@ an@@ ds of f@@ o@@ re@@ st st@@ o@@ c@@ k that were g@@ ro@@ w@@ n and t@@ en@@ ded p@@ ri@@ or to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 .
o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , this work of many dec@@ ad@@ es will not be taken into account when the effect of g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se g@@ a@@ se@@ s is c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ted .
and so it is that we are re@@ w@@ ar@@ ding just those who have d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed their f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and are now h@@ ur@@ ri@@ ed@@ ly t@@ r@@ ying to do some pl@@ an@@ ting , while they have first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most been d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ ying them for c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ri@@ es .
they who have t@@ en@@ ded their f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s pro@@ per@@ ly for dec@@ ad@@ es , li@@ v@@ ed o@@ f@@ f f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and know this d@@ el@@ ic@@ ate b@@ al@@ ance , would be pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed , because there are Member States in which people no longer have an@@ y@@ where to pl@@ ant a t@@ re@@ e , un@@ less they start pl@@ an@@ ting them on their own ro@@ o@@ f@@ s .
for this reason , par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 1@@ 7 in this report is very important .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and se@@ as are a@@ m@@ on@@ g the most important c@@ ar@@ b@@ on s@@ in@@ ks and st@@ o@@ re@@ s , and it has also been seen that the ability of f@@ o@@ re@@ st s@@ o@@ i@@ l in the n@@ or@@ th to ab@@ s@@ or@@ b c@@ ar@@ b@@ on is even greater than that of t@@ re@@ es .
but , ladies and gentlemen , the situation is such that we cannot g@@ ro@@ w se@@ as : of the two we can only g@@ ro@@ w f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s c@@ re@@ ate peace .
that is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing an ever greater f@@ ac@@ to@@ r when it comes to con@@ t@@ ent@@ ment - I think it is fin@@ e for N@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ do - and it c@@ re@@ a@@ tes ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical b@@ al@@ ance .
a de@@ a@@ d t@@ re@@ e is s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c , and you can le@@ an against it , whether it is w@@ ar@@ m or c@@ ol@@ d ; you can only le@@ an against a ro@@ c@@ k when it is w@@ ar@@ m .
the use of w@@ o@@ o@@ d is th@@ us cause for di@@ ver@@ si@@ fication , and especially now , when we are at the stage where com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation is mo@@ v@@ ing further a@@ way from pa@@ per , which is w@@ o@@ o@@ d @-@ based .
I would pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e that the Commission should an@@ n@@ e@@ x to some appropriate d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment a set of i@@ d@@ e@@ as for the m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e use of w@@ o@@ o@@ d , as we are now on the c@@ re@@ st of a w@@ a@@ ve with regard to w@@ o@@ o@@ d @-@ based production .
now the basis of the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity is ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing and the f@@ o@@ c@@ us is on new ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , for his excellent work and the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of cooperation that he has s@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to promote in his approach to this important issue .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the Commission d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es th@@ an@@ ks for a new t@@ y@@ p@@ e of com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation , in which a field of industry has been com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed from the point of view of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
the report is com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve in its present form .
during the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e Presidency an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al objective was ad@@ ded to it at the committee stage : that the EU should be the world &apos; s most d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c and com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve ec@@ on@@ om@@ y in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y sector also .
our group su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the v@@ i@@ e@@ ws set for@@ th in the report and most of the amendments to it .
we ourselves are ta@@ b@@ ling a few amendments , which we ask you to support .
I would in particular like to m@@ en@@ tion A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 3 , which ra@@ is@@ es the question of the importance of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es .
when it is at its best , the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y sector can s@@ er@@ ve as a mo@@ de@@ l for other se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s regarding how r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able natural resources can be ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited , how c@@ ar@@ b@@ on from the at@@ m@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ here b@@ in@@ ds in products and how the ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als su@@ p@@ p@@ ly c@@ ha@@ in wor@@ ks in an en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able , yet , at the same time , ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic@@ ally prof@@ it@@ able , way .
in this s@@ en@@ se , the importance of con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion with w@@ o@@ o@@ d should be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted more ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
it is also important to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the importance of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y for less de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed areas , and especially for rural areas in di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
this importance is particular e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ent in the area of employment .
the Union should work more e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y in the future to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p small b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses that use ra@@ w ti@@ m@@ b@@ er , for example .
Mr President , I welcome the rapporteur &apos;s em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able f@@ o@@ re@@ st in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es which are indeed of pr@@ im@@ ary importance to the European Union .
however , the Commission &apos;s com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation is rather a h@@ o@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ p@@ o@@ d@@ ge which l@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ s together w@@ il@@ ly @-@ n@@ il@@ ly the pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing industry which is k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge @-@ based and con@@ t@@ ent @-@ f@@ o@@ c@@ used with pr@@ im@@ ary f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es and also pa@@ per production .
the pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing industry is both un@@ ha@@ p@@ p@@ y and b@@ em@@ used , to say the least , and this is not how we promote the European Union n@@ or how things work in the Member States .
the pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing industry fe@@ el@@ s that there is a lack of rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of its particular re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments with regard to the ex@@ p@@ an@@ ding I@@ T sector .
the Commission could be open to the acc@@ u@@ sa@@ tion , indeed , that perhaps it pre@@ f@@ ers an I@@ T sector de@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d of con@@ t@@ ent .
I would re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d , Commissioner , that you look s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly at this question and re@@ view this whole di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of la@@ b@@ our .
may I also take issue with the report &apos;s par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 2 : p@@ e@@ at is not a w@@ o@@ o@@ d su@@ b@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te , it is a f@@ u@@ e@@ l / f@@ er@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ er in its own right .
I know there are particular I@@ r@@ ish and F@@ in@@ n@@ ish interests here , but I do not believe that we can accept p@@ e@@ at as a f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based industry .
it is a com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly se@@ par@@ ate f@@ u@@ e@@ l sector which has also f@@ er@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ er as a com@@ p@@ on@@ ent .
c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change : the rapporteur makes some in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing com@@ ments here .
I agree with h@@ i@@ m that we should ur@@ g@@ ently implement the K@@ y@@ o@@ to A@@ g@@ re@@ ement .
that is what we all want to do .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s are , of course , important st@@ or@@ ag@@ es of C@@ 0@@ 2 but the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for ex@@ p@@ an@@ sion of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s in the EU is l@@ im@@ ited , even if welcome .
however , I f@@ a@@ i@@ l to understand the re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the o@@ c@@ e@@ ans .
we have had o@@ c@@ e@@ ans since time im@@ m@@ em@@ or@@ i@@ al , and this has nothing to do with our present problems with c@@ li@@ ma@@ te change , so I agree with my other c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es and cannot see what possible re@@ le@@ v@@ ance that par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h has .
finally , with regard to the pa@@ per industry : it should c@@ le@@ an up its b@@ a@@ d for@@ m@@ er rec@@ or@@ d on the p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ tion of the environment , and it is also important to in@@ qu@@ ir@@ e into the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es of m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ ies in the pa@@ per sector , particularly with regard to c@@ ar@@ te@@ l@@ s in the rec@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ ing sector .
Mr President , I should like to re@@ f@@ er b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly to the importance of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y from a rural development as well as a family @-@ f@@ ar@@ m per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
European ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture will always re@@ main c@@ r@@ it@@ ical to the well @-@ being of European rural ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies - indeed , it re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the main op@@ tion for economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , production con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ s ensure that many farmers cannot increase their in@@ come from farming and , therefore , al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve in@@ come @-@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ating opportunities from o@@ f@@ f @-@ f@@ ar@@ m ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities are v@@ it@@ al if rural p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions are to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th .
we have seen the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of rural development programmes , including the L@@ E@@ A@@ D@@ E@@ R s@@ ch@@ em@@ e and other such ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities which have h@@ el@@ p@@ ed c@@ re@@ ate much n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed employment in small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es in rural areas throughout Europe .
however , the op@@ tion to en@@ g@@ age in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity can also be a very con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tive and en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ly m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m for farmers to increase their ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing in@@ come .
in the I@@ r@@ ish government &apos;s national development plan for 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 , a to@@ ta@@ l of I@@ E@@ P 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ m is being pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
this would be co@@ f@@ un@@ d@@ ed under the common agricultural rural development programme .
this la@@ t@@ ter in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment will support a pl@@ an@@ ting programme in I@@ re@@ land of over 20 000 h@@ a per year over the per@@ i@@ o@@ d of the plan .
the f@@ o@@ c@@ us will be for on @-@ f@@ ar@@ m f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y , with g@@ r@@ an@@ ts , pl@@ an@@ ting and ma@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ance , as well as in@@ come @-@ support pre@@ m@@ i@@ u@@ m .
in addition to C@@ A@@ P support and measures , an al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of I@@ E@@ P 8@@ 0@@ m has been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed in the regional op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al programme for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment in h@@ ar@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment , f@@ o@@ re@@ st roads and general w@@ o@@ od@@ land im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents .
with regard to the EU op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al programme for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and the g@@ en@@ er@@ ous funding available for a@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ ation , it is im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that the end pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t of this in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment is a quality , su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able f@@ o@@ re@@ st pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t , one c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of y@@ i@@ el@@ ding over time a re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n both for the in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al f@@ ar@@ m@@ er and the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
because of the re@@ la@@ tive re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of t@@ re@@ es to sur@@ v@@ i@@ ve , the necessary si@@ l@@ va@@ cultural p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es could be n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ ted in the e@@ ar@@ ly years of e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of new f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
this must be a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ed if the European sector is to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of quality and com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in the future .
on a b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive , Parliament should be aware of the serious th@@ re@@ at to the world &apos;s t@@ ro@@ p@@ ical f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s , which are d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ing by 1@@ 5 million h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res an@@ n@@ u@@ ally .
not su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch is being done on the g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing of t@@ ro@@ p@@ ical h@@ ar@@ d@@ w@@ o@@ od@@ s .
in this regard , we should be aware of the work of the European F@@ o@@ re@@ st In@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te and its en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ement and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch into the pl@@ an@@ ting of new t@@ ro@@ p@@ ical f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
if we are to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the need for su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability , we must ta@@ c@@ k@@ le these problems very e@@ ar@@ ly on .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly to@@ p@@ ical , especially be@@ ar@@ ing in mind the still very wor@@ r@@ ying situation of the people working in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es who were the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of the December 1999 st@@ or@@ m@@ s .
we must therefore welcome this b@@ ro@@ ad@@ en@@ ed approach to in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al policy and the Community f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y strategy .
to t@@ al@@ k of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s at a time of k@@ e@@ en wor@@ l@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e com@@ p@@ et@@ ition , the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es involved in the enlargement and re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing of the rural world w@@ h@@ il@@ st ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing the di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and the m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity of the f@@ o@@ re@@ st is , of course , a good th@@ ing .
however , I feel b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to in@@ for@@ m Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en that I was rather dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by his report , which se@@ em@@ s to me to take a s@@ om@@ e@@ what si@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ is@@ ti@@ c approach towards the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the w@@ o@@ o@@ d industry .
I get the re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that he se@@ es f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y as in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al production un@@ its based on in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve s@@ in@@ g@@ le @-@ c@@ ro@@ p farming n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ it@@ ating a re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion every th@@ ir@@ ty years .
R@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing from F@@ in@@ land , where I w@@ it@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ sed p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y this kind of in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ve c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ tion , which it is ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al to the pa@@ per industry to promote , I n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s think , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , that the w@@ e@@ al@@ th of Europe re@@ si@@ d@@ es s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally in its di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
while I may be con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed of the v@@ al@@ i@@ d@@ ity of this approach to c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ting the N@@ or@@ di@@ c f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s , I think the report should have taken account of f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s where b@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity su@@ b@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s , for example in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , as well as in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es other than pa@@ per in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
it se@@ em@@ s to me that there was a t@@ en@@ d@@ ency to for@@ get e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing to do with ti@@ m@@ b@@ er and other w@@ o@@ o@@ d @-@ based con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als made in other par@@ ts of Europe .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , we will support this report as its approach is quite si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant , as well as the excellent amendments tabled by our c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t for A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 , which se@@ em@@ s to us ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ ant .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able and prof@@ it@@ able f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and w@@ o@@ o@@ d industry is h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly important for Europe in many w@@ a@@ y@@ s .
I would like to re@@ mind you about both environmental aspects and ec@@ o @-@ social and economic aspects .
as a ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al , w@@ o@@ o@@ d is the most important r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce in Europe , and no one should un@@ de@@ re@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ te the importance in regional policy terms of small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ ses in the w@@ o@@ o@@ d industry and in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ers of j@@ o@@ b@@ s in rural areas .
this sector is a key f@@ ac@@ to@@ r in a m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al agricultural and f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry . together , the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and w@@ o@@ o@@ d in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es provide m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of j@@ o@@ b@@ s in Europe .
a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry can make a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al contribution to c@@ li@@ ma@@ te protection and to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing the K@@ y@@ o@@ to objectives .
g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king , we must pro@@ te@@ c@@ t our f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s in order to de@@ f@@ end ourselves against dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers .
I am therefore very gra@@ te@@ ful to the pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er for her com@@ ments .
I would particularly like to draw attention to pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s and v@@ i@@ r@@ g@@ in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s in the A@@ l@@ p@@ s .
appropriate proposals for the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion industry need to be pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed .
the use of w@@ o@@ o@@ d and w@@ o@@ o@@ d products in the b@@ u@@ il@@ ding industry should be pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted , and w@@ o@@ o@@ d should in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly be used in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of other con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion ma@@ te@@ ri@@ als .
a further ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of w@@ o@@ o@@ d is that it in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es fi@@ x@@ ing large qu@@ an@@ t@@ ities of C@@ O@@ 2 over long per@@ i@@ od@@ s .
I therefore support the approach of using ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting and ad@@ ver@@ t@@ is@@ ing measures for w@@ o@@ o@@ d products to ra@@ ise public a@@ w@@ ar@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
we need to provide information and ad@@ v@@ ice about the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ es of these products throughout Europe .
I am not ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ating a Community f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y policy , but rather a common f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y strategy for Europe , with the Commission pla@@ ying a pro@@ per co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating role .
the various aspects of f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es should be co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated within a s@@ in@@ g@@ le di@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ general , and it would make s@@ en@@ se for this to be the di@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ general for ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , which would also need to be a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ed to c@@ op@@ e with the w@@ i@@ d@@ e v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of ta@@ s@@ ks involved .
without f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y there can be no w@@ o@@ o@@ d industry .
so I hope that the House will accept this l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ c and vote for A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ments N@@ o@@ s 1 and 2 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to both congratulate and com@@ mis@@ er@@ ate with the rapporteur , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en .
this report on the f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es co@@ ver@@ s just about every important area i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ able , and very much of what it sa@@ y@@ s is cor@@ rec@@ t .
however , I would still like to com@@ ment on a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of points .
first , I think what is mis@@ sing here is a re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments in this sector as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds m@@ er@@ g@@ ers and ac@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
this particularly ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the pa@@ per industry at present , where more and more com@@ p@@ an@@ ies are m@@ er@@ g@@ ing because they believe this is essential if they are to re@@ main com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve .
my fe@@ a@@ r is that Europe , which I hope will itself be g@@ ro@@ w@@ ing together , will in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly be f@@ ac@@ ed with c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es com@@ par@@ able with those in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a and other countries , where the p@@ res@@ sure which com@@ p@@ an@@ ies are com@@ ing under is simply pa@@ s@@ sed on to their f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s , which are being ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited in the most b@@ r@@ u@@ ta@@ l way .
I therefore hope that the Commission will bring forward appropriate and clear proposals , if at all possible in the form of directives .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the environment , we should not f@@ o@@ o@@ l ourselves .
n@@ ine years after R@@ i@@ o we are still a long way from being able to m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ fully implement what was agreed there in terms of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability .
in the long r@@ u@@ n , we will pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly have to pre@@ par@@ e for our n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s to ab@@ s@@ or@@ b what the t@@ ro@@ p@@ ical f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s of the T@@ h@@ ir@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d cannot , for w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er reasons .
so in future f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s will above all be very g@@ re@@ at@@ ly involved in environmental protection , which b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s me to my third point , that is to say the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t .
I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally very much hope that the idea of the pa@@ per@@ less o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e and perhaps even of a pa@@ per@@ less Parliament , by v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ e of the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t , will not just give r@@ ise to qu@@ i@@ e@@ t s@@ m@@ il@@ es but actually become a re@@ al@@ ity .
although this would have a cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ding impact on j@@ o@@ b@@ s in the industry , it would make s@@ en@@ se en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king .
that is my last point .
to su@@ m up , this report c@@ re@@ a@@ tes a n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ ve im@@ p@@ res@@ sion .
it re@@ la@@ tes too much to ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , and it rather g@@ i@@ v@@ es the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion of t@@ r@@ ying to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t something that really can no longer be pro@@ te@@ c@@ ted .
we only have to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed to the st@@ e@@ e@@ l industry .
I do not think it makes s@@ en@@ se to su@@ b@@ si@@ d@@ ise this sector .
but the idea of su@@ p@@ por@@ ting small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es which is con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 3 is very positive .
it is also extremely important for us to consider the issue of c@@ ar@@ te@@ l@@ s , given the most recent t@@ r@@ en@@ ds in this sector .
Mr President , un@@ like Mr C@@ h@@ ic@@ h@@ e@@ st@@ er , I have no l@@ in@@ ks with the st@@ r@@ on@@ g F@@ in@@ n@@ ish th@@ em@@ e in this report , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t for the fact that I wor@@ k@@ ed , with the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st of p@@ le@@ a@@ sure , at the Commission under the a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity of Commissioner L@@ i@@ i@@ k@@ an@@ en .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing this com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on the &apos; f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based industry &apos; .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for acc@@ e@@ p@@ ting some of my amendments in the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y , even though he se@@ es no need for A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 , which I p@@ res@@ en@@ ted .
I would like to ask just one question , Mr President , which ti@@ es in p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y with A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 5 and re@@ la@@ tes to the position of the pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing industry within the Commission services .
I re@@ a@@ d in the p@@ res@@ s that , in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 , Commissioner W@@ al@@ l@@ st@@ r@@ ö@@ m ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ged the fact that the pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing industry must not be re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded as b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ ing to the f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , as the place it now o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ ies within the European Commission might le@@ a@@ d one to believe .
is this also the opinion of the Commission ?
if this is the case , what are its pl@@ ans for the future ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , w@@ o@@ o@@ d is a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al , a con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al with a future .
w@@ o@@ o@@ d re@@ g@@ ro@@ ws , it ro@@ ts and fin@@ ds its way back into the natural c@@ y@@ c@@ le from which it c@@ a@@ me .
so we should not for@@ get w@@ o@@ o@@ d in the S@@ i@@ x@@ th F@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ work P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me on R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch - we should make sure that the priority area for w@@ o@@ o@@ d is acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up with due c@@ are , especially in the field of b@@ i@@ o@@ te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
I believe that w@@ o@@ o@@ d will be a l@@ o@@ t more important for us in the future than it has been in the past .
as w@@ o@@ o@@ d is also very w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y used in the international con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion industry , the w@@ o@@ o@@ d industry f@@ ac@@ es n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous problems .
it has to deal with a h@@ u@@ ge number of technical trade b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers , a m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ pl@@ ic@@ ity of national st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds and a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ is@@ ation procedures and also , to some ex@@ t@@ ent , b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c te@@ st@@ ing , monitoring and c@@ er@@ ti@@ fication re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
this is an area where the European Commission should apply S@@ L@@ I@@ M .
and perhaps the w@@ o@@ o@@ d sector is an i@@ d@@ e@@ al one for in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing mo@@ de@@ l procedures , p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly including B@@ E@@ S@@ T .
I would like to thank H@@ ans @-@ P@@ e@@ ter M@@ ar@@ t@@ in , as pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing small and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ z@@ ed en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es is , of course , a c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and essential matter , and one where we have an important par@@ t@@ n@@ er in the Commission .
however , there is also the matter of making appropriate ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to b@@ u@@ il@@ ding la@@ ws and re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , because f@@ ir@@ e re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions in Europe in particular v@@ ar@@ y w@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ y .
we believe it is high time that the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion products directive was adopted .
this directive in particular would en@@ able great progress to be made in mar@@ k@@ e@@ ting w@@ o@@ o@@ d .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds world trade , I would like to st@@ res@@ s that J@@ ap@@ an has very re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tive legislation in this area .
this is something we also need to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s because w@@ o@@ o@@ d is , after all , not just a ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al and a con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al , but it will also be h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly important in future through b@@ i@@ o@@ te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
that is why we especially want to promote s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ er b@@ i@@ om@@ as@@ s power st@@ ations , which will make an important contribution to Europe &apos;s energy s@@ el@@ f @-@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , so that this is also an area where w@@ o@@ o@@ d has an important role to pla@@ y .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , who pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t report .
as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the Committee on the E@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ ment , P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c H@@ e@@ al@@ th and C@@ on@@ su@@ m@@ er P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , I am especially en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged by how the report has man@@ ag@@ ed to take account of ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical and even par@@ tly s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o @-@ economic conditions in the industry , ac@@ tive , as it is , in the market .
I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f wish to ra@@ ise the issue of p@@ e@@ at , which is de@@ al@@ t with in the second par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h of the report .
the report c@@ al@@ l@@ s for the in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of the p@@ e@@ at industry in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er .
this is most j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
it will support many a@@ im@@ s of the energy policy which the EU is t@@ r@@ ying to d@@ ri@@ ve through , and which it has just mentioned in the G@@ re@@ en P@@ ap@@ er on energy .
p@@ e@@ at will re@@ in@@ for@@ ce the situation regarding our s@@ el@@ f @-@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency in energy and its gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , which , al@@ ar@@ min@@ g@@ ly , are in dec@@ line ; and it will promote the com@@ b@@ in@@ ed production of el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity and he@@ at , and bring with it the s@@ y@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ c b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of the use of w@@ o@@ o@@ d and p@@ e@@ at for energy .
given that p@@ e@@ at g@@ ro@@ w@@ th is on a year @-@ to @-@ year basis , it is clearly also a r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able energy s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce .
mo@@ re@@ over , p@@ e@@ at has many re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally positive effects that favour employment .
on the whole , p@@ e@@ at should be com@@ pa@@ red to w@@ o@@ o@@ d rather than c@@ ar@@ b@@ on , for example , which is now how it is c@@ la@@ s@@ sed by the EU , going against what is f@@ ac@@ t@@ u@@ ally cor@@ rec@@ t .
the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ability of p@@ e@@ at is an in@@ con@@ te@@ st@@ able b@@ i@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical fact .
p@@ e@@ at g@@ ro@@ ws con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally through the as@@ si@@ m@@ il@@ ation of bo@@ g pl@@ an@@ ts and the production of f@@ o@@ re@@ st l@@ it@@ te@@ r .
its or@@ i@@ g@@ in is in principle ex@@ ac@@ tly the same as that of other b@@ i@@ om@@ as@@ ses that d@@ er@@ i@@ ve from pl@@ an@@ ts , for example w@@ o@@ o@@ d .
the time necessary for the process is longer , however .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to a new , im@@ par@@ ti@@ al s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c report , p@@ e@@ at should be d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h@@ ed from f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l f@@ u@@ el@@ s , which take m@@ il@@ li@@ ons of years to form .
o@@ w@@ ing to its or@@ i@@ g@@ in and e@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ ally r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able nature , p@@ e@@ at must be c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fied as a b@@ i@@ om@@ as@@ s f@@ u@@ e@@ l , but because it re@@ g@@ ro@@ ws su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally more s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly than other pl@@ an@@ ts , a new , third c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y should be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed and pla@@ c@@ ed between f@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ l f@@ u@@ el@@ s and energy s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ability ra@@ te is f@@ a@@ st .
p@@ e@@ at is a b@@ i@@ om@@ as@@ s f@@ u@@ e@@ l with a s@@ l@@ o@@ w r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ability ra@@ te .
it is un@@ d@@ en@@ i@@ able that b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing p@@ e@@ at , as with w@@ o@@ o@@ d f@@ u@@ e@@ l , pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ se g@@ as em@@ is@@ si@@ ons in the at@@ m@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ here .
the K@@ y@@ o@@ to agreement does not in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de em@@ is@@ si@@ ons from b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing w@@ o@@ o@@ d in the over@@ all em@@ is@@ si@@ ons b@@ ur@@ d@@ en , as the c@@ ar@@ b@@ on that is se@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ red in w@@ o@@ o@@ d would be re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d in any case when the w@@ o@@ o@@ d dec@@ a@@ y@@ s .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , st@@ u@@ di@@ es on c@@ ar@@ b@@ on levels and g@@ as c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tion in p@@ e@@ at@@ l@@ an@@ ds have come out in recent years and their results s@@ how it would be de@@ si@@ ra@@ ble to have a r@@ e @-@ evaluation of p@@ e@@ at f@@ u@@ e@@ l em@@ is@@ si@@ ons which to@@ o@@ k account of g@@ as levels in bo@@ g@@ s as a whole .
when we speak of p@@ e@@ at it is wor@@ th re@@ min@@ ding ourselves of sc@@ al@@ e .
the area de@@ voted to energy use is very small com@@ pa@@ red to the areas of mar@@ sh@@ land used in f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture .
the p@@ e@@ at h@@ ar@@ v@@ est ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for less than one per m@@ i@@ l of the to@@ ta@@ l area of n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n p@@ e@@ at@@ l@@ an@@ ds .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the economic ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation of p@@ e@@ at is important in those areas where there is a l@@ o@@ t of mar@@ sh@@ land .
for example , in F@@ in@@ land we use less than h@@ al@@ f the an@@ n@@ u@@ al g@@ ro@@ w@@ th of p@@ e@@ at each year .
we therefore do not t@@ ou@@ ch the c@@ ap@@ it@@ al , because the interest is enough to get by on .
the report ur@@ g@@ es the Commission to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation and co@@ h@@ er@@ ence of Community se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ al action having an impact on f@@ o@@ re@@ st c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ers , in order to improve com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s .
this need for co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation and co@@ h@@ er@@ ence would in particular ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to apply to p@@ e@@ at , and one important st@@ e@@ p on the road would be to change the way it is c@@ la@@ s@@ si@@ fied and its st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s , to cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ d with its t@@ r@@ u@@ e nature .
Mr President , first I wish to thank all the members of Parliament and , in particular , the rapporteur E@@ s@@ k@@ o S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , for his excellent report .
the Commission is ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to adopt the report and the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t resolution .
they are in line with the Commission &apos; s v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
the report is ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ ve and ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ res in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l those n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s that a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry , both the t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble and the in@@ t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble .
we particularly agree with you that in@@ t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s , such as prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al s@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ s , in@@ no@@ va@@ tions and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and development work , are cor@@ n@@ er@@ st@@ on@@ es of the position regarding com@@ p@@ et@@ ition in European industry .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g the most important priorities is en@@ sur@@ ing there is this high level of prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al s@@ k@@ il@@ l .
first of all I would like to sh@@ ed a little li@@ g@@ h@@ t in just a few words on how important this sector of industry is .
it ac@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts for 1@@ 0 % of all in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al ou@@ t@@ put in the EU , whether m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red in terms of v@@ al@@ u@@ e ad@@ ded or number of j@@ o@@ b@@ s .
it is wor@@ th re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ ing that a to@@ ta@@ l of 1@@ 2 million p@@ ri@@ va@@ te f@@ o@@ re@@ st o@@ w@@ n@@ ers su@@ p@@ p@@ ly w@@ o@@ o@@ d to industry , and the sector is re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted e@@ ver@@ y@@ where in the EU .
the industry is often l@@ o@@ c@@ ated in re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e regions , where it h@@ el@@ p@@ s to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , levels of employment and the infrastructure .
fi@@ ve main areas of the industry form one of the b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ est in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s in the European Union .
the v@@ al@@ u@@ e of its ou@@ t@@ put st@@ an@@ ds at more than EUR 3@@ 00 b@@ il@@ li@@ on , its v@@ al@@ u@@ e ad@@ ded at EUR 1@@ 1@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on .
it g@@ i@@ v@@ es di@@ rec@@ t employment to 2@@ .@@ 5 million people , and in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e is much l@@ ar@@ g@@ er than that .
in the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation the state of com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st industry and in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es re@@ la@@ ted to it was ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed by v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ing the sector in a new way , as a c@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ er , in which each sector &apos; s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts the com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the other se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s .
in such an ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation by groups any an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al areas may be over@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed , but qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons can be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed from a b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ point .
the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation o@@ f@@ f@@ ers a basis for the future evaluation of f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s having an impact on com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in this industry .
that is why the Commission has made a s@@ er@@ ies of se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ al st@@ u@@ di@@ es of the f@@ o@@ re@@ st industry and in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es re@@ la@@ ted to it .
st@@ u@@ di@@ es on the pr@@ in@@ t@@ ing and m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ ised in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es have already been pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
in addition , the Commission has e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed , as an ex@@ t@@ en@@ sion to the com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation in hand , two ch@@ an@@ n@@ el@@ s for debate .
one is an ad@@ v@@ is@@ or@@ y committee on f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y and f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e work g@@ o@@ t under way again in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 , and the other is a for@@ u@@ m for f@@ o@@ re@@ st and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
this for@@ u@@ m pla@@ y@@ s a major role , as it makes it possible to s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally an@@ al@@ y@@ se essential qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons and in@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ t e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y with com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al organisations and other in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed parties .
re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es from the Community &apos; s institutions , such as Parliament and the Commission , as well as the Member States also par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the for@@ u@@ m .
the first for@@ u@@ m was held here in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er , it was made up of people of a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity , and I might m@@ en@@ tion that the rapporteur , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en , was also present .
there were also dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons about pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing , which Mrs F@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ ch mentioned : ec@@ om@@ m@@ er@@ ce and in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al and in@@ te@@ l@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty rights were dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed .
the next for@@ u@@ m is to be held in S@@ to@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ ol@@ m in J@@ un@@ e .
that will f@@ o@@ c@@ us on a c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r look at how f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es can , for their part , promote su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development and op@@ ti@@ mis@@ e their contribution to the protection of the environment at all st@@ ag@@ es of the production c@@ ha@@ in from f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y itself right up to the end products .
it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing ever more important to take account of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development .
in J@@ un@@ e we shall be h@@ ol@@ ding the meeting of the European Council in G@@ o@@ th@@ en@@ b@@ ur@@ g , at which important decisions will be taken in this area .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es are those in which all the economic , social and environmental aspects of su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development are c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent on one another .
f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es use r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able ra@@ w ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al and the most up @-@ to @-@ d@@ ate rec@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ ing and energy @-@ sa@@ v@@ ing m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s , so its contribution may well be especially important for su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development .
in re@@ p@@ ly to Mrs F@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ ch &apos; s question I would say this : we understand very well that pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing today di@@ f@@ f@@ ers from the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y industry pro@@ per , and in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es production based on pa@@ per just as much as many other in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es .
the problem for the Commission has been that the resources of the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al for E@@ n@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise have f@@ al@@ l@@ en by 20 % over the last year .
we have l@@ o@@ s@@ t 2@@ 1@@ 0 st@@ a@@ f@@ f in all .
we have had to com@@ b@@ ine de@@ par@@ t@@ ments and o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
I am n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s pre@@ pa@@ red to take this matter up now as a subject for discussion again , ma@@ in@@ ly with a mind to l@@ o@@ o@@ king at in which sector or in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with which sector pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing would best be pla@@ c@@ ed .
I will be in con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the industry after this debate .
once again I wish to thank Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en for an excellent report and the other members for their contribution to this work .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
we shall now pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to the vote .
Madam President , I wish to put a request to you and the House .
my report was to have been de@@ b@@ ated this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , but has been put back to this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on , al@@ on@@ g with the vote .
unfortunately I cannot st@@ a@@ y , so I would be gra@@ te@@ ful if it could be de@@ f@@ er@@ red until the next part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
Madam President , this is ex@@ ac@@ tly what we fe@@ a@@ re@@ d when the F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ ting was done a@@ way with - that we would no longer be able to do our work on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on either .
Mrs P@@ ac@@ k , you will understand that it is not for the President to com@@ ment on these ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions .
let me say only that , in the p@@ rec@@ ise case re@@ f@@ er@@ red to me , Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report was ti@@ m@@ e@@ tabled for this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , but we did not have time to deal with it .
Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i is ab@@ s@@ ent this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on and cannot st@@ a@@ y be@@ h@@ in@@ d to present his report .
I think it appropriate , un@@ less there are any ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , to agree to his request to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one the report due to his ab@@ s@@ ence this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on and in view of the fact that the report could not be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed at the ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted time .
Madam President , we are quite ha@@ p@@ p@@ y for you to te@@ m@@ p@@ er j@@ u@@ st@@ ice with m@@ er@@ c@@ y , as it were .
however , I would like to support Mrs P@@ ac@@ k and make the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l point that if we are having sh@@ or@@ ter part @-@ se@@ s@@ si@@ ons it is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble for reports not to be voted on because ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s are no longer present on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
we agree with the procedure adopted today , but we would like you to make it clear once again , including to committee c@@ ha@@ ir@@ s , that Members should ensure that they st@@ a@@ y until T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
Mr S@@ w@@ ob@@ od@@ a , I agree en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly with you .
it Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report had not been ti@@ m@@ e@@ tabled for this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , I should not have had this opportunity .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only en@@ d@@ or@@ se the com@@ ments made by Mrs P@@ ac@@ k and Mr S@@ w@@ ob@@ od@@ a , but I feel that the problems in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing amendments to the s@@ ch@@ ed@@ u@@ le are also due to what I would call p@@ o@@ or ti@@ m@@ e@@ ta@@ b@@ ling , as we n@@ e@@ v@@ er se@@ e@@ m able to k@@ e@@ e@@ p to the set agenda .
we are con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally having to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one the discussion of reports .
I think this is re@@ la@@ ted to the fact that we are not man@@ ag@@ ing our time well enough and that we should perhaps also change and re@@ as@@ se@@ s@@ s a number of w@@ a@@ y@@ s in which the House op@@ er@@ a@@ tes . I believe , however , that c@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing the part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion to f@@ our d@@ a@@ y@@ s is the main reason for all these de@@ par@@ t@@ u@@ res from the agenda .
if we c@@ u@@ t the pl@@ en@@ ary part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion working time to three and a h@@ al@@ f d@@ a@@ y@@ s , the next th@@ ing we shall be down to two d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
what is the point of the European Parliament ?
it is up to all the Members of the House to s@@ how how serious they are in their work , in line with the com@@ m@@ it@@ ments they have made as Members of Parliament .
this is the issue being raised again .
Madam President , I want to make two b@@ ri@@ e@@ f points in this context .
the first is that all w@@ e@@ e@@ k we have been he@@ ar@@ ing people t@@ al@@ king about the decision to ab@@ ol@@ ish the F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ ting .
now w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er decision was taken and however we voted in that decision , a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c decision was taken by the House and the next opportunity to change that will ar@@ ise when we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ a@@ r for 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 .
I think it is un@@ d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c to k@@ e@@ e@@ p ra@@ is@@ ing it .
secondly , if we look at the agenda for this w@@ e@@ e@@ k , we see that the agenda for M@@ on@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing was free .
so perhaps we could also look at w@@ a@@ y@@ s of making better use of our time and using the M@@ on@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing for de@@ b@@ a@@ tes .
then we would all be fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed by T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on and could go h@@ om@@ e and do our j@@ o@@ b@@ s on F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y .
Madam President , I am one of those who were most op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to doing a@@ way with the F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ ting .
I am therefore ent@@ it@@ led to state that I think that , when a request is made to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one the vote on a report which is ti@@ m@@ e@@ tabled for the end of T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day &apos; s s@@ it@@ ting , and which must be p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by a Member who has to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l 2000 k@@ m to get h@@ om@@ e and who , if he cannot take the only f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t available , on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on , is then for@@ c@@ ed to go h@@ om@@ e on F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y e@@ v@@ en@@ ing , we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t also to s@@ how some f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ bility with regard to his situation in future .
unfortunately , this is a vote I consider ir@@ responsible , and it pla@@ c@@ es us in this situation , which we must man@@ age in as responsible a m@@ an@@ n@@ er as possible in the com@@ ing m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
we do not need to start a debate on the issue .
Madam President , in the context of these issues , a te@@ e@@ th@@ ing problem has ar@@ is@@ en with the f@@ our @-@ day w@@ e@@ e@@ k in relation to transport .
it is im@@ possible until next December to get on the S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g @-@ B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t at 4@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . on a T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
that has re@@ su@@ l@@ ted in many of our st@@ a@@ f@@ f and p@@ res@@ s o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ers having to le@@ a@@ ve on the 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
that is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble .
could you p@@ le@@ a@@ se t@@ al@@ k to the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers @-@ that @-@ be and put ex@@ t@@ r@@ a f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts back to B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing to ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ate our st@@ a@@ f@@ f , so that they can st@@ a@@ y here all T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Mrs D@@ o@@ y@@ le , since you ra@@ ise the subject , I can in@@ for@@ m you that S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g T@@ own H@@ all has ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted Mr R@@ ies as the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive to deal with all these problems , and any others , which may em@@ er@@ ge .
I had a l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y meeting with Mr R@@ ies this w@@ e@@ e@@ k and , on my initiative , we dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed these specific problems , because they are problems that I am well aware of , and not just for one n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ ity but for all the Members of the House .
Mrs B@@ or@@ d@@ es , this is not a pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l motion .
vote
Madam President , while f@@ l@@ ying from M@@ il@@ an to S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g I was in the p@@ il@@ o@@ t &apos; s c@@ ab@@ in c@@ ha@@ t@@ t@@ ing with the p@@ il@@ o@@ t , as I s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es do , and he was te@@ l@@ ling me all about his problems re@@ la@@ ting to working h@@ ou@@ r@@ s , pa@@ y and pen@@ si@@ ons .
I t@@ ol@@ d h@@ i@@ m that ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures in the civil a@@ v@@ i@@ ation sector , including pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on for re@@ gu@@ la@@ ting the work of a@@ v@@ i@@ ation em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es , were due to be de@@ b@@ ated in the European Parliament , al@@ on@@ g with technical re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , and I as@@ su@@ red h@@ i@@ m that I would ask for a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation to the Member States to give p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er and e@@ ar@@ li@@ er pen@@ si@@ ons , for p@@ il@@ o@@ t@@ s are of key importance for our safety .
Madam President , last M@@ on@@ day I to@@ o@@ k the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to give e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence to the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Members of this House on the recent decision of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish government g@@ r@@ an@@ ting c@@ l@@ em@@ ency to f@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ en t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s .
in no motion for a resolution on human rights do we find the s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ te@@ st re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m of S@@ pa@@ in though many countries are s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally mentioned .
this is most re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble as the par@@ d@@ on from the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish government has been g@@ r@@ an@@ ted in order to guarantee im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity to t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s and to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in t@@ or@@ ture as a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l practice in its strategy of re@@ p@@ res@@ sion .
on human rights , once again , h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ is@@ y has been voted through in this Parliament .
United N@@ ations Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a
the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the a@@ i@@ r transport sector and the st@@ i@@ f@@ f com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es has c@@ a@@ u@@ sed serious problems by er@@ od@@ ing safety st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds for pa@@ s@@ s@@ en@@ g@@ er a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t .
it is therefore im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that we in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ised re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments in order to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in a high st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of safety which is not under@@ min@@ ed by com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
both the Committee on T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and the rapporteur have im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed on the Commission &apos;s proposals .
it is also im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve , where no proposals for agreed rules are made by in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed parties , that the European Parliament itself take the initiative on f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t ti@@ m@@ es and on working ti@@ m@@ es and other re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for the f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and c@@ ab@@ in c@@ re@@ w by 1 M@@ a@@ y 2001 , taking account of the needs of workers and safety re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments .
this matter is even more ur@@ g@@ ent given that the Commission , unfortunately under p@@ res@@ sure from the a@@ ir@@ line com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , has f@@ a@@ il@@ ed in the te@@ x@@ t to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e any measures l@@ im@@ it@@ ing f@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t ti@@ m@@ es .
the only reason we voted in favour of this j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution is the st@@ ance adopted in favour of ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ing the death pen@@ al@@ ty and the a@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion of a few b@@ a@@ si@@ c pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es regarding the e@@ quality of women , the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of children and op@@ position to ra@@ c@@ i@@ al dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation .
although the resolution ex@@ pl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly m@@ en@@ tions a number of countries , such as T@@ i@@ b@@ e@@ t , C@@ h@@ ine , A@@ f@@ g@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ ta@@ n , P@@ a@@ pu@@ a @-@ N@@ e@@ w G@@ u@@ in@@ e@@ a and C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , where human rights are e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y v@@ i@@ ol@@ ated in many , if not all areas , not a wor@@ d is said regarding the major p@@ o@@ w@@ ers , the European Union in particular , which , while they do not n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y v@@ i@@ ol@@ ate human rights at h@@ om@@ e , v@@ i@@ ol@@ ate them in their for@@ m@@ er c@@ ol@@ on@@ ies , either di@@ rec@@ tly or by g@@ i@@ v@@ ing protection to d@@ ic@@ ta@@ t@@ or@@ s that r@@ i@@ d@@ e r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ d over human rights .
when human rights ap@@ p@@ e@@ als come from those su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from the lack of human rights or from as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations working g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y to re@@ li@@ e@@ ve the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en of op@@ p@@ res@@ sion , at least in the areas they are responsible for , we s@@ how our s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity .
yet , as far as the major p@@ o@@ w@@ ers which are responsible for the ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation and op@@ p@@ res@@ sion of the greater part of the world , and their political re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es , are concerned , re@@ f@@ er@@ ences to human rights are , g@@ en@@ er@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king , nothing more than h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ical dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ ted by their di@@ pl@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c and military action and by those &apos; reasons of state &apos; g@@ en@@ er@@ ally used as a f@@ r@@ on@@ t to con@@ c@@ e@@ al the s@@ or@@ did interests of major financial groups that do not c@@ are one b@@ it about human be@@ in@@ g@@ s or their rights .
H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en R@@ e@@ por@@ t ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 1 / 2000 )
Madam President , still in the p@@ il@@ o@@ t &apos; s c@@ ab@@ in on the pl@@ an@@ e from M@@ il@@ an to S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g and still c@@ ha@@ t@@ t@@ ing to the p@@ il@@ o@@ t - I even re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er his n@@ a@@ me , A@@ n@@ to@@ ine - I t@@ ol@@ d h@@ i@@ m how wor@@ ri@@ ed I was about a@@ i@@ r tra@@ v@@ e@@ l , because we can n@@ e@@ v@@ er be sure whether f@@ l@@ ying is sa@@ f@@ e and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es there are accidents .
&@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ W@@ h@@ at do you mean , Mr F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o ? &apos; re@@ p@@ li@@ ed the p@@ il@@ o@@ t .
&@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ F@@ l@@ ying is the sa@@ f@@ est form of transport there is .
it is on the roads that most accidents ha@@ p@@ p@@ en .
of all for@@ m@@ s of transport , the c@@ a@@ r c@@ a@@ u@@ ses by far the most de@@ a@@ th@@ s and in@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es . &apos;
so I am really d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted to welcome this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment - and I have voted for it - through which Europe is taking specific action to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the very serious d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by road accidents .
Madam President , I wish to speak on this report because it is necessary for the European Union to find a more effective way to ensure that Member States who make com@@ m@@ it@@ ments in relation to matters of life and death actually com@@ p@@ ly with those com@@ m@@ it@@ ments .
the report points out that during the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ s the number of road de@@ a@@ th@@ s f@@ el@@ l in the European Union by 2@@ 6 % .
in I@@ re@@ land , however , the f@@ all has only been by 1@@ 3 % .
we have the third h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent ra@@ te in the European Union and we have the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est f@@ at@@ al@@ ity ra@@ te in the European Union .
the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al S@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ y Council just last A@@ u@@ gu@@ st in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated that as far as they were concerned they did not see any political commitment to actually de@@ al@@ ing e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y with road safety .
it e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted that of the 6@@ 2 000 young people who s@@ at the le@@ a@@ v@@ ing c@@ er@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ate ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ation in J@@ un@@ e 2000 within e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t years 1@@ 000 would be de@@ a@@ d in un@@ necessary c@@ a@@ r accidents .
this se@@ em@@ s to me to be a g@@ ro@@ te@@ s@@ qu@@ e situation and quite simply should not be t@@ ol@@ er@@ ated by the European Union .
if Member States make com@@ m@@ it@@ ments to implement the matters which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t life and death than we have to find w@@ a@@ y@@ s of en@@ sur@@ ing that they com@@ p@@ ly with those com@@ m@@ it@@ ments .
con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions are due Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en on her con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ ous , th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h and in@@ no@@ va@@ tive work .
road safety is indeed a serious area in which we cannot a@@ f@@ for@@ d to in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge in h@@ y@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ is@@ y and h@@ y@@ per@@ b@@ ol@@ e , which the rapporteur a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ s ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly .
there are some Members in this House who will take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of this issue to d@@ em@@ and that the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity be st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed , le@@ a@@ v@@ ing Member States to man@@ age road safety decisions as they wish .
I , however , share the rapporteur &apos; s opinion as , while ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing the key position of the st@@ a@@ tes in this area , she n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ es that this is an area where responsibility is s@@ ha@@ red between Community , national , regional and local authorities .
the great dis@@ par@@ ities between Member States , particularly with regard to s@@ p@@ e@@ ed l@@ im@@ its and &apos; a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ised &apos; b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ d al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l levels , do nothing to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of accidents on the roads of Europe .
within the European Union , road accidents are the number one cause of death in children and ad@@ ul@@ ts under 4@@ 5 .
I , therefore , like the rapporteur , consider it essential that the Commission does not con@@ fin@@ e itself to a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation on al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ l levels , but se@@ ts a clear l@@ im@@ it at 0@@ .@@ 5 m@@ g / l .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al support must be given to the European as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment programme for new c@@ a@@ r m@@ od@@ el@@ s ( E@@ ur@@ o @-@ N@@ C@@ A@@ P ) .
this could be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally , in the form of a proposal for a directive .
in the same way , we must consider in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ f@@ ying the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing l@@ in@@ k between the environment and road safety ( le@@ ad@@ ing us , for example , to re@@ as@@ se@@ s@@ s road si@@ g@@ n@@ s and mar@@ king to make them sa@@ f@@ er ) .
we must all accept our res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , and that is what the rapporteur se@@ ts out to do in this initiative which does her great c@@ re@@ d@@ it .
I shall therefore vote in favour of this report .
I would like to com@@ m@@ en@@ d M@@ s H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t @-@ P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en for her very th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h report on a subject that is of great concern to all of us .
the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s are quite st@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ing : 4@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 de@@ a@@ th@@ s on the EU &apos; s roads every year , an e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted 1@@ .@@ 7 million people in@@ j@@ u@@ red to one de@@ g@@ re@@ e or another .
it is clear that this issue re@@ qu@@ i@@ res the con@@ c@@ er@@ ted efforts of all concerned : EU , national and local authorities , as well as the many v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y organisations and initiatives which a@@ i@@ m to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the problem of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents .
the number of f@@ a@@ ta@@ l accidents v@@ ar@@ ies g@@ re@@ at@@ ly from one Member State to another r@@ an@@ g@@ ing from 6@@ 0 to 2@@ 4@@ 3 per million with an EU a@@ ver@@ age of 1@@ 1@@ 6 .
in my own country , I@@ re@@ land , there are 1@@ 2@@ 9 per@@ s@@ ons per million in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts k@@ il@@ led on the roads each year .
I find particularly dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing the fact that road accidents are the most common cause of death a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st children and people under 4@@ 5 years of age in the EU .
this is an in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ able situation .
the fi@@ gu@@ res s@@ how clearly that the number of f@@ a@@ ta@@ l accidents can be re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed d@@ ra@@ st@@ ic@@ ally throughout the EU .
it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al that our commitment to sa@@ v@@ ing li@@ v@@ es on the roads , in particular those of our young people , is not just a li@@ p @-@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ice .
there must be a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate resources in@@ j@@ ec@@ ted into pro@@ ac@@ tive policies at Union level so as to help in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States improve their tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic safety rec@@ or@@ ds .
at present the Commission &apos; s road safety b@@ u@@ d@@ get is EUR 8 million per year .
I believe that the Commission needs to s@@ en@@ d out a st@@ r@@ on@@ g si@@ g@@ n@@ al of its de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce road c@@ a@@ su@@ al@@ ti@@ es .
I would call on the Commission to increase si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly the road safety b@@ u@@ d@@ get and indeed to encourage Member States to follow su@@ it .
money s@@ p@@ ent on re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing road accidents is money well s@@ p@@ ent .
in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate road safety costs society and the Member States a great deal of money .
the human tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y is im@@ m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ ra@@ ble , but at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts have been made to qu@@ an@@ ti@@ fy the d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge , and these s@@ how that the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous economic c@@ o@@ s@@ t of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents in the form of m@@ ed@@ ical and em@@ er@@ g@@ ency t@@ re@@ at@@ ment , d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to pro@@ per@@ ty and l@@ o@@ s@@ s of in@@ come a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts to about EUR 1@@ 00 b@@ il@@ li@@ on per an@@ n@@ u@@ m .
things are certainly mo@@ v@@ ing in the right di@@ rec@@ tion .
during the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ s , the number of road de@@ a@@ th@@ s in the EU f@@ el@@ l by 2@@ 6 % .
this t@@ r@@ end must now be ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed and st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed .
Parliament has con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ently held that one of the major political g@@ o@@ als of transport policy is to give priority to measures to improve safety for all m@@ od@@ es of transport , as well as pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ing the necessary financial resources for this pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e .
the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities and in@@ j@@ u@@ ri@@ es on Europe &apos; s roads is not something which is pre@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed .
we must make im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing road safety a political priority and provide the financial means to ma@@ t@@ ch .
while everyone is in agreement in con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ing the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able number of road accidents in the various European Member States , the E@@ D@@ D Group is un@@ able to agree com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly with M@@ s H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en &apos; s report on the appropriate means to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the subject , for the s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion cannot be ever more European a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity , more money and more c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
this co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ i@@ l , which has already been ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in v@@ ar@@ ying de@@ g@@ re@@ es in a number of countries , has pro@@ v@@ ed in@@ effective .
on the other hand , re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ ing p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al measures with specific national ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s would se@@ e@@ m to be an a@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ e wor@@ th ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing if we want to achieve positive p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al results .
the means of transport that the c@@ a@@ r re@@ p@@ res@@ ents , with all it en@@ ta@@ il@@ s , is more a matter of training , be@@ ha@@ v@@ i@@ our and c@@ ul@@ ture .
so how is it therefore possible to find s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed for the whole of Europe ?
in our view , M@@ s H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en &apos; s report re@@ p@@ res@@ ents the very an@@ ti@@ th@@ e@@ si@@ s of the su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity we st@@ ri@@ ve to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve , not out of d@@ o@@ g@@ ma@@ t@@ is@@ m but in order to be as e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent as possible while res@@ p@@ ec@@ ting everyone &apos; s di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , all in the interests of our various p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es .
what stage are we at with the implementation of real s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , the t@@ y@@ p@@ e of s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions that re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment ?

though , of course , this is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly more difficult than ad@@ op@@ ting a pu@@ re@@ ly pu@@ n@@ it@@ i@@ ve approach , which in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ es , for example , in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ing a ra@@ d@@ a@@ r m@@ on@@ it@@ or in an un@@ mar@@ k@@ ed p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e c@@ a@@ r , at the end of a com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ted s@@ li@@ pro@@ a@@ d to a three @-@ l@@ an@@ e m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way .
I w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly support the report by my S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e which c@@ al@@ l@@ s for new measures to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le road de@@ a@@ th@@ s and promote road safety in Europe .
s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ king st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s s@@ how the se@@ ver@@ ity of the problem .
it is simply un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble that as many as 4@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 people are k@@ il@@ led and over 1@@ .@@ 7 million in@@ j@@ u@@ red on roads ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the European Union every year .
of course , the n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers v@@ ar@@ y from country to country .
in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , there are as many as 2@@ 4@@ 3 and 2@@ 1@@ 2 de@@ a@@ th@@ s per million , w@@ h@@ il@@ st at the l@@ o@@ w@@ est end of the s@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ m , there are 6@@ 0 and 6@@ 1 de@@ a@@ th@@ s per million in Sweden in the U@@ K , res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y .
every per@@ s@@ on k@@ il@@ led is one too many .
every case is an in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y which te@@ ar@@ s a@@ part a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
we d@@ e@@ s@@ per@@ a@@ te@@ ly need to improve road safety with safety e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment in c@@ ar@@ s , se@@ at b@@ el@@ t c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s and better road si@@ g@@ n@@ s .
the L@@ ab@@ our Government in B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in is at the f@@ o@@ re@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t , le@@ ad@@ ing a c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n against d@@ r@@ in@@ k @-@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing .
the li@@ v@@ es of all our citizens , especially our young people , are too pre@@ c@@ i@@ ous to take for g@@ r@@ an@@ ted .
P@@ ol@@ i B@@ or@@ t@@ one R@@ e@@ por@@ t ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 5@@ 8 / 2000 )
road tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic accidents are the most common cause of death a@@ m@@ on@@ g children and per@@ s@@ ons under the age of 4@@ 5 in the EU , which makes the problem a major public health issue .
in Sweden , &apos; V@@ is@@ i@@ on Z@@ er@@ o &apos; has been ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly by Parliament as an over@@ all objective of the work on road safety .
however , in order for these road safety objectives to be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , re@@ li@@ able to@@ ol@@ s are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed for meeting the ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s .
effective tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic sur@@ v@@ e@@ il@@ l@@ ance , including v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le in@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tions , s@@ p@@ e@@ ed monitoring using m@@ od@@ er@@ n c@@ a@@ m@@ er@@ a te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es , b@@ re@@ a@@ th@@ al@@ y@@ se@@ r te@@ st@@ s , se@@ at b@@ el@@ t ch@@ ec@@ ks and pu@@ p@@ il@@ l@@ om@@ e@@ ter m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ re@@ ment in cases where d@@ r@@ u@@ g @-@ use may be su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ted , is what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in the sh@@ or@@ t term to bring down the number of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities on the roads .
in order for the ta@@ r@@ get of z@@ er@@ o road f@@ at@@ al@@ ities to be re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c , more use must be made of public transport so as to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es on the road .
we will support the report in the fin@@ al vote , but we take the view that the efforts towards h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation are ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve .
the report is a par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y initiative , the main th@@ r@@ u@@ st of which is to d@@ em@@ and proposals for the h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation of road safety at EU level .
we consider this de@@ si@@ r@@ e to increase road safety to be all well and good , but this is not an issue in which the EU should be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing resources . rather , it is an issue which is best de@@ al@@ t with at Member State level .
Madam President , back in my se@@ at on the pl@@ an@@ e , I st@@ ar@@ ted c@@ ha@@ t@@ t@@ ing to the per@@ s@@ on s@@ it@@ ting next to me - a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er called L@@ in@@ o M@@ is@@ er@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ i - and at one point he re@@ mar@@ k@@ ed that we were f@@ l@@ ying over D@@ ü@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ d@@ or@@ f .
I l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ed out of the w@@ in@@ d@@ o@@ w and sa@@ w the c@@ ity . c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to it are some h@@ u@@ ge sh@@ ed@@ s , v@@ is@@ i@@ ble even from that great he@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
I as@@ k@@ ed my n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our what they were , and he t@@ ol@@ d me that they are a ter@@ min@@ us for l@@ or@@ ri@@ es and ra@@ il@@ way w@@ ag@@ ons &apos; T@@ h@@ at is an in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e , &apos; he said .
&@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ T@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ e in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al transport c@@ ent@@ res are very u@@ se@@ ful because f@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t has to be de@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ited in those sh@@ ed@@ s , so that transport is better , f@@ a@@ st@@ er and c@@ he@@ ap@@ er . &apos;
that is why I voted for this report .
Madam President , I w@@ an@@ ted to ex@@ pla@@ in that I particularly voted for the P@@ ol@@ i B@@ or@@ t@@ one report because A@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ment No 1 was adopted .
this amendment re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts the concern f@@ el@@ t about d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in c@@ re@@ ating the t@@ r@@ ans @-@ European ra@@ i@@ l n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks and ra@@ i@@ l cor@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ or@@ s .
this is an issue of particular importance for the A@@ l@@ p@@ ine region , from which I come , and especially so in the case of the M@@ un@@ ic@@ h @-@ V@@ er@@ on@@ a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ A@@ l@@ p@@ s line . we hope that as a result of Parliament &apos;s la@@ te@@ st vote , the Commission will regard itself as being ob@@ li@@ ged to further s@@ p@@ e@@ ed up the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant pre@@ par@@ at@@ or@@ y work and to pu@@ s@@ h a@@ he@@ a@@ d with greater con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion and e@@ f@@ for@@ t than has been the case up to now , so as to s@@ ol@@ ve this ur@@ g@@ ent problem for the A@@ l@@ p@@ ine region .
C@@ o@@ st@@ a P@@ a@@ ol@@ o R@@ e@@ por@@ t ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 4@@ 5 / 2000 )
Madam President , on the very c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way between B@@ er@@ g@@ a@@ m@@ o and M@@ il@@ an I was s@@ it@@ ting next to L@@ in@@ o M@@ is@@ er@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ i again , and we were t@@ al@@ king about m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way ta@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ s .
L@@ in@@ o M@@ is@@ er@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ i t@@ ol@@ d me he th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t it was right for h@@ i@@ m , as a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er , to have to pa@@ y to use the m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way , th@@ us con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting to the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion and ma@@ in@@ t@@ en@@ ance of an important it@@ e@@ m of transport infrastructure , but that it would be good if people who were still working did not have to pa@@ y a t@@ ol@@ l .
so , in v@@ o@@ ting for this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , I am as@@ king for a d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion to be made between those using the road for work and those using it in their s@@ par@@ e time . the for@@ m@@ er should not have to pa@@ y as much as the la@@ t@@ ter .
the report adopted in committee st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k a very c@@ a@@ re@@ ful b@@ al@@ ance between those who wish to mo@@ ve f@@ a@@ st@@ er to b@@ u@@ il@@ d on the common transport ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing framework with con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures and those who feel that public opinion is not re@@ ad@@ y for such a ra@@ d@@ ical re@@ th@@ in@@ king of the way society pa@@ y@@ s for the use of its transport infrastructure .
for these reasons , w@@ h@@ il@@ st I am s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c to many of the amendments tabled by the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s / European F@@ re@@ e A@@ l@@ li@@ ance for con@@ c@@ re@@ te measures , I cannot support them here , since they would j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e the con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s on the above pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es and can be ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ed la@@ ter in the course of the implementation of a ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing framework .
as u@@ su@@ al , the at first si@@ g@@ h@@ t la@@ u@@ d@@ able in@@ t@@ en@@ tions of a European Parliament report t@@ u@@ r@@ n out to con@@ c@@ e@@ al the wor@@ st .
in this case , the matter is ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for transport infrastructure .
you have to re@@ a@@ d between the l@@ in@@ es , though , to see ex@@ ac@@ tly what it is t@@ al@@ king about and if you do so , you come ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s two of the p@@ e@@ t th@@ em@@ es of this in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion : the c@@ re@@ ation of an environment tax and the war w@@ ag@@ ed on road transport and the c@@ a@@ r .
the one main pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e h@@ in@@ ted at in the report is to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e yet more ta@@ x@@ es on the road u@@ s@@ ers , who are already t@@ re@@ ated like Europe &apos; s c@@ as@@ h co@@ ws , and perhaps even to in@@ st@@ all t@@ ol@@ l g@@ a@@ tes and ch@@ ar@@ ge for the use of the main roads or min@@ or roads .
what pl@@ an@@ e@@ t do we think we are on ?
when the pr@@ ice of f@@ u@@ e@@ l is pro@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ve , at fi@@ ve to si@@ x ti@@ m@@ es the re@@ fin@@ er@@ y s@@ al@@ e pr@@ ice because more than 8@@ 0 % of the pr@@ ice is made up of ta@@ x@@ es , you might well think that the road u@@ se@@ r is already pa@@ ying more than enough for the right to use the public road n@@ et@@ work in pro@@ por@@ tion to the use he makes of his c@@ a@@ r .
that is without m@@ en@@ ti@@ on@@ ing all the other t@@ y@@ p@@ es of road tax ; it is too long a l@@ is@@ t and the l@@ it@@ any of a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts involved is too de@@ p@@ res@@ sing .
indeed , after re@@ ad@@ ing this report , one w@@ on@@ d@@ ers just what the ta@@ x@@ es we pa@@ y are actually used for .
nothing , ap@@ par@@ ently , since in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , for example , the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion &apos; s s@@ k@@ im@@ m@@ ing o@@ f@@ f h@@ al@@ f the national w@@ e@@ al@@ th does not en@@ able it to ensure the safety of the people , to achieve general w@@ el@@ f@@ are , to p@@ res@@ er@@ ve their quality of life or to provide a con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent and effective transport policy .
the state , the States , should think pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y of the way they use our money before g@@ i@@ v@@ ing B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s any s@@ or@@ t of power to n@@ e@@ ed@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly make the situation wor@@ se .
I share the report &apos; s pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary approach , which st@@ res@@ ses the need to take the external costs of ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing into greater con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , infrastructure needs to be m@@ e@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed and m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ ised .
but what funding must be s@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t ?
the report st@@ res@@ ses that nothing must h@@ in@@ d@@ er the development of the market in Member States , i@@ .@@ e@@ . that b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s prof@@ its must not be made use of .
the social d@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ ing p@@ ra@@ c@@ t@@ ised by the road industry or the s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ way con@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons , for example , are not ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ ed in any way .
not w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to increase ta@@ x@@ ation also en@@ ta@@ il@@ s pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing state in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion so as not to ob@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t the sa@@ c@@ ro@@ s@@ an@@ c@@ t r@@ u@@ le of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition .
on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , the rapporteur ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ tes pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing &quot; the a@@ i@@ m of p@@ ha@@ sing out d@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ tions of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between Member States &quot; .
no@@ where does the report make any re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to a state res@@ p@@ on@@ se to social needs , yet , on the other hand , the only res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the &quot; all market &quot; s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion is to ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to p@@ ri@@ va@@ te com@@ p@@ an@@ ies , for both the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion and the management of infrastructure .
as a result , the only parties to pa@@ y that are clearly i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied in the te@@ x@@ t are road u@@ s@@ ers , and that is why I shall not be v@@ o@@ ting in favour of this report .
K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u R@@ e@@ por@@ t ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 7@@ 3 / 2000 )
we agree with some of the el@@ em@@ ents of the report , s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally with the need to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p transport infrastructure for environmental su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability and the p@@ res@@ er@@ va@@ tion and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of the right of all citizens to movement and acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ bility to public transport services , although we think that these points should ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed in greater de@@ ta@@ i@@ l in the resolution as a whole .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , we can only op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of Community c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a that t@@ re@@ at all u@@ s@@ ers of transport al@@ i@@ k@@ e , taking no account of the various levels of infrastructure that currently ex@@ is@@ t in the Member States .
for these reasons , we will not be able to vote for the report .
we p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans must de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p a system that le@@ ad@@ s to a b@@ re@@ a@@ k@@ through in the principle of c@@ o@@ s@@ t transparency for transport pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ers .
this resolution is an important st@@ e@@ p , and c@@ al@@ l@@ s on the Commission to present some con@@ c@@ re@@ te proposals at long last .
transport problems can only be s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed on the basis of a European con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s .
as a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of a country that has to c@@ op@@ e with the con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able problems of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic in t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t through the A@@ l@@ p@@ s , I call on the European Union to de@@ vote more attention to this subject than it has to d@@ ate .
the Union has not yet a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted its responsibility in this area .
f@@ a@@ i@@ r com@@ p@@ et@@ ition between transport pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ers is only possible if external costs are also in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in ta@@ x@@ es .
it is essential for ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical and g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical aspects to be co@@ v@@ e@@ red in this uni@@ form system , for the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it of both the environment and the public .
in the li@@ g@@ h@@ t of the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity and democracy , I find it h@@ ar@@ d to en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in the idea that the European Union should be given its own right of ta@@ x@@ ation .
this ap@@ p@@ li@@ es also to the field of transport .
these proposals would , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ tions of the D@@ u@@ t@@ ch Government , increase the pr@@ ice of p@@ et@@ ro@@ l by a further 1@@ 5 per c@@ ent and the pr@@ ice of di@@ e@@ se@@ l by 2@@ 1 per c@@ ent , as well as in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the pr@@ ice of ti@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ts for m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m and long @-@ d@@ is@@ t@@ ance tra@@ in j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ e@@ y@@ s by al@@ most 5@@ 0 per c@@ ent .
the consequences of this for s@@ par@@ s@@ el@@ y @-@ p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted Swedish c@@ ou@@ n@@ ti@@ es which have already been h@@ it , such as D@@ al@@ ar@@ n@@ a with its high levels of ou@@ t@@ w@@ ar@@ d m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able dec@@ re@@ a@@ se in population , are ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous and to@@ t@@ ally de@@ va@@ st@@ ating .
the rapporteur w@@ is@@ h@@ es to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce new Government ta@@ x@@ es and EU ta@@ x@@ es , and also le@@ v@@ i@@ es on roads , ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s and a@@ ir@@ por@@ ts , c@@ a@@ r in@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ ce , l@@ or@@ ri@@ es and b@@ u@@ se@@ s , p@@ et@@ ro@@ l and di@@ e@@ se@@ l .
part of the funds ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed would go to the G@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ments of the Member States and then be e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed for in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ments in infrastructure , and part would go to the Commission to use as it se@@ es f@@ it .
should the resolution be ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed by the European Parliament and the Council of M@@ in@@ is@@ ters , the EU would be given its own di@@ rec@@ t power of ta@@ x@@ ation , as in an ac@@ t@@ u@@ al n@@ ation state .
that is a development to which the Swedish C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts do not wish to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te .
I take a very serious view of further in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing the costs of transport for people and g@@ o@@ od@@ s .
it is p@@ at@@ ently ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous that this will be a m@@ er@@ c@@ il@@ e@@ s@@ s b@@ l@@ o@@ w which will f@@ all h@@ ar@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t on the s@@ par@@ s@@ el@@ y @-@ p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ ted c@@ ou@@ n@@ ti@@ es .
mo@@ re@@ over , it is h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly in k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing with the s@@ p@@ ir@@ it of the European Community to make it more difficult and con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly more ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve for people to m@@ e@@ e@@ t each other in and between the various countries .
Madam President , there is a l@@ o@@ t of t@@ al@@ k about quotas in Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u &apos; s report .
I have ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ed , and this is why .
I have been national se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y of the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party in I@@ t@@ al@@ y since 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 3 , and throughout that time people have been as@@ king why I re@@ p@@ res@@ ent the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party when I am not a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er .
they say I am too young to be re@@ ti@@ red , which is very n@@ ice , but it often bo@@ th@@ ers me that people should think s@@ om@@ e@@ one who is not re@@ ti@@ red might not be able to st@@ and up for pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers .
Madam President , do you think not being re@@ ti@@ red means I cannot de@@ f@@ end pen@@ si@@ on@@ ers with de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation , con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion and con@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ y ?
so does not being a w@@ om@@ an mean a m@@ an cannot de@@ f@@ end the rights of women just as well ?
that is why I am not so k@@ e@@ en on quotas .
Madam President , a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s Party ( C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts ) and the European D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts voted against the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report .
this si@@ g@@ n@@ al could be mis@@ in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted or even t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed against us to sc@@ or@@ e political points .
we are not , of course , op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to e@@ qu@@ al opportunities policy and we are certainly not against women &apos;s participation .
we agree with the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es en@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ated by Commissioner D@@ i@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ to@@ p@@ ou@@ l@@ o@@ u at the end of this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing &apos;s debate .
we are in favour of ma@@ in@@ st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ ing measures in b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , in public institutions , in education , training and c@@ ul@@ ture .
we are in favour of b@@ u@@ il@@ ding up political n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks and we need European in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s such as b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king .
we are also in favour of con@@ c@@ re@@ te actions and measures being im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted in the EU Member States .
we have d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted this in countries where C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts and C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ v@@ es are in power .
women are d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ b@@ ly h@@ ol@@ ding le@@ ad@@ ing p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons in our parties .
for example , in G@@ er@@ many , my own par@@ ty , the C@@ D@@ U , has a w@@ om@@ an le@@ ad@@ er and in the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s Party ( C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts ) and the European D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able number of the national d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations are led by women .
so there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that we support the objective of e@@ qu@@ al opportunities , and this was also ap@@ par@@ ent from the s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es that my f@@ em@@ al@@ e c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es and I made this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
however , the rapporteur , Mrs K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u , and her S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group were not pre@@ pa@@ red to support our amendments re@@ j@@ ec@@ ting the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of quotas throughout Europe .
there are various different systems in the EU Member States for en@@ sur@@ ing that women are pro@@ per@@ ly re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king .
and , con@@ t@@ r@@ ary to what ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s in the report , these are not la@@ i@@ d down by governments , but by the parties , when they are d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up their l@@ is@@ t@@ s .
that is the way it should st@@ a@@ y - that is what the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity is all about .
so any at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to make out that my group , because a ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of its Members voted against the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report , is in some way op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed participation of men and women in the decision @-@ making process , any such at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t is certainly d@@ o@@ om@@ ed to f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e .
Madam President , it is not only necessary for the over@@ all th@@ r@@ u@@ st of i@@ d@@ e@@ as and initiatives to be right - above all the de@@ ta@@ i@@ l must also be right .
we of course voted against the right @-@ w@@ ing amendment which ap@@ par@@ ently v@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ ed the report &apos; s proposal that the pro@@ por@@ tion of women , or of men , in el@@ ec@@ ted bo@@ di@@ es should be at least 4@@ 0 % as ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve .
we voted in favour of this dis@@ pu@@ ted c@@ la@@ use in the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report even though we are con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that quotas are no s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , far from it , to the in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities which women su@@ f@@ f@@ er both in decision @-@ making p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons and , much more , in society in general .
I voted in favour of the K@@ ar@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ o@@ u report .
reports and con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to this debate re@@ mind us that some of our wor@@ st fe@@ ar@@ s are j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation still ex@@ is@@ t@@ s , and it still ta@@ k@@ es women with &quot; f@@ ir@@ e in their b@@ el@@ li@@ es &quot; to make it through the d@@ en@@ se system of h@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ en pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ice and b@@ re@@ a@@ k through in political , trade and other organisations .
A@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive action is still necessary - until real e@@ quality ex@@ is@@ t@@ s , not just where great t@@ al@@ ent is present , but also for those who are less for@@ c@@ e@@ ful .
women are uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ally under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted where decisions are made .
at the start of the third m@@ il@@ l@@ en@@ n@@ i@@ u@@ m , women are still fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting for the right , on pa@@ per at least , to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t system , a right which s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m g@@ a@@ ve them at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e se@@ es the problem of the lack of participation by women in the decision @-@ making process not simply as a problem of democracy ; it is a si@@ g@@ n of social in@@ e@@ quality and ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation of the c@@ la@@ s@@ ses , which is why it ma@@ in@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts working c@@ la@@ s@@ s women .
the ap@@ par@@ ent interest in democracy in the family ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in the motion for a resolution is in fact an interest in re@@ ver@@ sing full employment ( the motion f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly ad@@ m@@ its as much ) , and re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing and p@@ ri@@ va@@ t@@ is@@ ing w@@ el@@ f@@ are services .
mo@@ re@@ over , so @-@ called e@@ qu@@ al opportunities policies and various EU programmes have pro@@ v@@ en to be nothing more than the means to promote c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t re@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ing .
they a@@ i@@ m to di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e the b@@ ur@@ d@@ en e@@ qu@@ ally and to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce social services to the family , th@@ e@@ re@@ by st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ ing at the working c@@ la@@ s@@ ses and ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ating the situation of women in practice and , as a result , they are responsible for ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ding women from the ma@@ in@@ st@@ re@@ am .
women will only g@@ a@@ in their ri@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ ful place both in the family and in political and economic life by j@@ o@@ in@@ ing the ma@@ s@@ s gra@@ s@@ s @-@ ro@@ o@@ t@@ s movement fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting to re@@ ver@@ se the policies responsible for their under @-@ re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion .
real participation by women cannot be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed with quotas for their participation in institutions which fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against their interests and promote part @-@ time work , the p@@ ri@@ va@@ t@@ is@@ ation of health , w@@ el@@ f@@ are and education , longer working h@@ ou@@ r@@ s and a la@@ ter re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age .
we dis@@ agree with the im@@ position of quotas on political parties because they are organisations which people j@@ o@@ in v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ il@@ y and they al@@ one have the right to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e on their st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture and how they op@@ er@@ ate .
to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e quotas on political parties is to in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ e in their internal a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s and tra@@ m@@ p@@ le on the c@@ ol@@ le@@ c@@ tive will of a political organisation .
we shall not op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive measures to improve the participation of women in the decision @-@ making process , pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed that they are ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed by the cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ding gra@@ s@@ s @-@ ro@@ o@@ t@@ s policy and can therefore e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y re@@ mo@@ ve b@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers to the participation of women .
ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive measures not ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed by such a policy give r@@ ise to s@@ el@@ f @-@ d@@ el@@ u@@ sion and are mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ing , which is why we cannot support is@@ ol@@ ated measures of an ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive nature , as proposed in the resolution .
these were the reasons why the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e ab@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ed from the vote .
I shall vote in favour of the report because it has the m@@ er@@ it of once more h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent problem regarding the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of women in political life .
the report , quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly , points out that education is an essential to@@ o@@ l in com@@ b@@ ating st@@ e@@ re@@ o@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ es and in e@@ qu@@ al training for children of both se@@ x@@ es from the e@@ ar@@ li@@ est age .
however , two aspects which I think essential are mis@@ sing .
the first is the economic situation : as long as women are the pr@@ im@@ ary v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of an economic system which for@@ c@@ es them into part @-@ time work , se@@ con@@ d@@ ary in@@ come and in@@ se@@ c@@ ur@@ e j@@ o@@ b@@ s , to ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t them to get involved in political life will re@@ main a p@@ i@@ ous hope .
the second is the political situation : the report could at least put forward rules for el@@ ec@@ ted re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es which re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e new people to be el@@ ec@@ ted in each le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive term th@@ e@@ re@@ by en@@ ab@@ ling a t@@ u@@ r@@ no@@ v@@ er in members which would favour the el@@ ec@@ tion of more women .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , there should be a b@@ an on h@@ ol@@ ding more than one o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , and there could be a time l@@ im@@ it on r@@ e @-@ el@@ ec@@ tion per@@ i@@ od@@ s .
S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en R@@ e@@ por@@ t ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 4 / 2000 )
Madam President , last w@@ e@@ e@@ k I w@@ ent to see a pen@@ si@@ on@@ er who li@@ v@@ es in a v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in the B@@ er@@ g@@ a@@ m@@ o v@@ al@@ le@@ y . his n@@ a@@ me is G@@ i@@ u@@ se@@ p@@ p@@ e C@@ ar@@ min@@ at@@ i and he is a w@@ o@@ od@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ ter .
he t@@ ol@@ d me he s@@ pen@@ ds a l@@ o@@ t of time on his own up the m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in , de@@ e@@ p in the w@@ o@@ od@@ s , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es at n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t because w@@ o@@ o@@ d that is c@@ u@@ t by the full mo@@ on b@@ ur@@ n@@ s better in the fi@@ re@@ place - but I have always k@@ no@@ w@@ n that . &apos; I do feel very l@@ on@@ el@@ y , &apos; he said .
&@@ ap@@ o@@ s@@ ;@@ B@@ u@@ t now that the European Parliament is v@@ o@@ ting to as@@ s@@ is@@ t f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es , p@@ le@@ a@@ se te@@ l@@ l the President of Parliament , as a re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of all of you , that I will feel that the European Parliament is c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to me in my w@@ o@@ od@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ ter &apos; s work .
even at n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t , by the full mo@@ on , it will be as if Mrs F@@ on@@ ta@@ ine is with me to k@@ e@@ e@@ p me com@@ p@@ an@@ y , and then my work will be e@@ a@@ si@@ er . &apos;
the S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en report on f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based and re@@ la@@ ted in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es is a st@@ e@@ p in the right di@@ rec@@ tion , en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ ing as it does to over@@ come the con@@ fin@@ es of com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s and c@@ re@@ ate w@@ i@@ d@@ er and de@@ e@@ p@@ er pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for European f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s .
it is particularly important in this context to :
de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p f@@ o@@ re@@ st @-@ based in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ es within the framework of v@@ i@@ able development ;
ensure that natural resources are r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able ;
for@@ m@@ u@@ late a f@@ o@@ re@@ st strategy and co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate the various Community policies which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t it ;
promote re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p f@@ o@@ re@@ st products for m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ p@@ le pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses , such as m@@ ed@@ ical ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations .
particular importance should be at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s in the Mediterranean and the Balkans which pre@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly su@@ p@@ por@@ ted n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities and which are now in d@@ an@@ g@@ er of dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ ing .
that is why we need special Community action programmes for f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s in the Mediterranean and the Balkans .
the S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en report has not received our support for a v@@ ar@@ i@@ et@@ y of reasons .
for one , the Commission and rapporteur l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y l@@ im@@ it su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability in the f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ r@@ y sector to re@@ pla@@ c@@ ement pl@@ an@@ ting al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e c@@ u@@ t@@ t@@ ing .
that , however , is not j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
first of all , in this way , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en does not pa@@ y su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent attention to b@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , w@@ h@@ il@@ st production f@@ o@@ re@@ st can e@@ a@@ si@@ ly le@@ a@@ d to m@@ on@@ o@@ c@@ ul@@ ture .
it is therefore essential to pl@@ ant a di@@ ver@@ se r@@ an@@ ge of s@@ p@@ ec@@ ies .
the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ er pla@@ y@@ s an important role in this , but is often bo@@ w@@ ing to the p@@ res@@ su@@ res of free market for@@ c@@ es .
it is therefore necessary to c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ sc@@ ri@@ be market for@@ c@@ es .
it is re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ta@@ ble that the report does not take this su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
secondly , the report in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts the need to min@@ im@@ ise em@@ is@@ si@@ ons .
w@@ o@@ o@@ d b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing is not a su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of energy , because C@@ O@@ 2 and other p@@ ol@@ l@@ u@@ ting su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es are re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d in the process .
more su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de g@@ as@@ sing and com@@ p@@ o@@ st@@ ing .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , it is qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ able whether f@@ o@@ re@@ st@@ s could be used as c@@ ar@@ b@@ on s@@ in@@ k in order to achieve the K@@ y@@ o@@ to em@@ is@@ sion ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s .
after all , w@@ o@@ o@@ d b@@ ur@@ n@@ ing must also be in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded as a s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of c@@ ar@@ b@@ on .
A@@ d@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally , the rapporteur does not do j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity when he as@@ ks for Community action in the field of education , te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y and resources for the Commission .
both within and ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the EU , su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ ability is a f@@ ac@@ to@@ r in com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s which is g@@ a@@ in@@ ing in importance .
it therefore d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es more of a bo@@ o@@ s@@ t than proposed by the rapporteur .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded at 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5@@ 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 3 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to speak on the subject of this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on &apos; s agenda .
this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , the President sa@@ w f@@ it to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ing Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report .
I agreed , as rapporteur on the subject of long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as , to having my report dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
since then , however , I have received ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es from a great number of members who in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to take part in this debate .
the C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs , Mr W@@ at@@ s@@ on , ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ised as he will be un@@ able to att@@ end .
I also received ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es from Mr P@@ ir@@ k@@ er , C@@ o@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ to@@ r for the P@@ P@@ E Group , Mrs T@@ er@@ r@@ ó@@ n i C@@ u@@ s@@ i , C@@ o@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ to@@ r for the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Group , and from Mr H@@ er@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z M@@ ol@@ la@@ r , who were s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to speak this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
there are other Members , too , in ex@@ ac@@ tly the same position .
I feel that the ab@@ s@@ ence of these Members who were down to speak on a report which was one of the priorities of the French Presidency means that we cannot have the pro@@ per debate which we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to have on a subject on which Parliament must be con@@ su@@ l@@ ted before the Council may dec@@ i@@ d@@ e .
in my c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity as rapporteur and on behalf of the P@@ P@@ E Group , I am therefore re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ing , Mr President , that my report be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed until a la@@ ter part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
Mr President , I cannot agree with Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z .
I have some s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y with your p@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t , Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , but we only agreed the agenda at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the w@@ e@@ e@@ k , and Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos;s com@@ ments this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing were in@@ c@@ or@@ rec@@ t .
he c@@ la@@ im@@ ed that his report had been on this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing &apos;s agenda .
re@@ a@@ d the agenda .
it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s the debate as r@@ un@@ n@@ ing from 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . to 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , and his report was at the end of the l@@ is@@ t with the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report .
in other words , it was clear from the ou@@ t@@ set that the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z and F@@ er@@ r@@ i reports would be con@@ si@@ de@@ red and voted on this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing , and I have made my own ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , and I wish to in@@ s@@ is@@ t on this .
the President also said this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on that the vote would take place at 6 p@@ .@@ m@@ . in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of at 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , and the debate on to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance would end at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
that means that we have h@@ al@@ f an h@@ our to consider this to@@ p@@ i@@ c .
I am v@@ ice @-@ c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs , and I can te@@ l@@ l you that if our c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es are not here , I am quite ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to use all their s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king time and to state my v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report , which is excellent .
Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t , that is an an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ement of an in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion of al@@ most t@@ w@@ ent@@ y min@@ u@@ tes during the debate on the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t &apos;s last st@@ a@@ te@@ ment , his th@@ re@@ at to t@@ al@@ k for 20 min@@ u@@ tes non @-@ st@@ o@@ p about the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report , really is an ar@@ gu@@ ment for de@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing the report at this stage .
however , the b@@ a@@ si@@ c problem here is something quite different .
Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t has in fact said e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing that needs to be said .
what we are w@@ it@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ing here - and we have already de@@ b@@ ated this once this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on , as we also did on M@@ on@@ day and T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day - is , and I shall make no b@@ on@@ es about it , an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally under@@ min@@ e S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g as the se@@ at of Parliament .
ta@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ s like this are c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing just that .
Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t , even if it would make a v@@ al@@ u@@ able contribution if you were to speak for 20 min@@ u@@ tes - and I too could also speak for 20 min@@ u@@ tes , as no one el@@ se is le@@ f@@ t from my group either - in re@@ al@@ ity it would mean that the work Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z has so c@@ a@@ re@@ fully done would not be de@@ b@@ ated in the way it d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es here .
to that ex@@ t@@ ent I can understand Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s de@@ si@@ r@@ e that his report , which is based on the approach de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed in the committee and which should be re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted here in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er , should be given a re@@ as@@ on@@ able he@@ ar@@ ing in the pl@@ en@@ ary .
so I really am in favour of de@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing a report as important as this one , and for my part I would re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d acc@@ ed@@ ing to Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s request .
we are not g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing into a debate on a pro@@ c@@ ed@@ u@@ ra@@ l point . we are he@@ ar@@ ing a proposal , one opinion against , and one in favour .
now , com@@ m@@ en@@ ting on what Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z has said , I have this to say .
Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , on behalf of your group , you as@@ k@@ ed for the debate to be ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed .
then we he@@ ar@@ d a different opinion from Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t , who b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to the same group .
but in any case , that is a se@@ con@@ d@@ ary issue , because under R@@ u@@ le 1@@ 4@@ 6 of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e a decision cannot be taken now on a matter like this .
we cannot vote on this point now .
you can request and pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e - that is , a political group or at least th@@ ir@@ ty @-@ two Members can do so - ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ing the debate to another time in Parliament &apos; s s@@ ch@@ ed@@ u@@ le , but only at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of the debate .
you cannot do so now .
you can only present that proposal , on behalf of your group , when the debate st@@ ar@@ ts at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , not now .
ex@@ c@@ use me , Mr President , but su@@ re@@ ly in this in@@ st@@ ance the r@@ u@@ le should have been the same as for Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report was p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed even though , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to your in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e , this should not have been al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed .
given that it was possible to do this for Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i , I do not , therefore , see why it would not be possible to do so in my case in order to or@@ g@@ an@@ ise this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on &apos; s agenda better .
I am not as@@ king for a special favour , simply for the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of the procedure ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
but I am not ap@@ pl@@ ying this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing &apos; s procedure ; I am ap@@ pl@@ ying R@@ u@@ le 1@@ 4@@ 6 and , despite the ap@@ pla@@ use from Mr F@@ or@@ d and others , I am going to re@@ a@@ d it out to you : &apos; at the start of a debate on an it@@ e@@ m on the agenda , a political group or at least th@@ ir@@ ty @-@ two Members may mo@@ ve that the debate be ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed to a specific d@@ ate and time .
such a motion shall be put to the vote im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly . &apos; so , not now , but at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
to@@ p@@ ical A@@ N@@ D U@@ R@@ G@@ E@@ N@@ T D@@ E@@ B@@ A@@ T@@ E
the next it@@ e@@ m is the debate on to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance .

B@@ 5 ­ 0@@ 0@@ 7@@ 5 / 2001 by Mrs R@@ an@@ d@@ z@@ i@@ o @-@ P@@ la@@ th , Mr v@@ an d@@ en B@@ er@@ g , Mr C@@ or@@ b@@ et@@ t and Mr I@@ i@@ v@@ ar@@ i , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , on the international t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a ;
B@@ 5 ­ 0@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 / 2001 by Mr V@@ in@@ c@@ i , Mr H@@ er@@ m@@ an S@@ ch@@ m@@ i@@ d and Mr M@@ an@@ is@@ c@@ o , on behalf of the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ al Group of the European United L@@ e@@ f@@ t / N@@ or@@ di@@ c G@@ re@@ en L@@ e@@ f@@ t , on the law on the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge t@@ ri@@ al in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
Mr President , at long last we have a result . the le@@ ad@@ ers of the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge &apos; s re@@ i@@ g@@ n of ter@@ ro@@ r are being b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t before an &quot; international &quot; t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al .
we are p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly has dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed on this un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly and would like the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t r@@ ul@@ in@@ g@@ s to be carried out as s@@ o@@ on as possible .
after all , it is in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ able , certainly for the f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds and re@@ la@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s , that so far , not one s@@ in@@ g@@ le K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge le@@ ad@@ er has been pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed for his or her c@@ r@@ im@@ es and that the pro@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ is@@ t@@ s of years g@@ one by are still free citizens in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a , not to m@@ en@@ tion the for@@ m@@ er K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge members &apos; in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement in the government .
however , the con@@ t@@ ent of the adopted le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive d@@ ra@@ f@@ t has for@@ c@@ ed us to make a number of c@@ r@@ it@@ ical com@@ ments .
after years of t@@ u@@ g @-@ of @-@ war between the United N@@ ations and C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a , it is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing clear that a s@@ ha@@ k@@ y com@@ pr@@ om@@ ise has been re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y those legal a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s against which UN ex@@ per@@ ts ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed their v@@ e@@ to in a re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ation three years ago , that have now been in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the mo@@ de@@ l adopted .
the country &apos; s re@@ g@@ im@@ e , which is also c@@ ul@@ pa@@ ble , has man@@ ag@@ ed to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ e every last d@@ ro@@ p out of the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations in this matter .
d@@ u@@ b@@ i@@ ous st@@ a@@ te@@ ments from C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an government le@@ ad@@ ers se@@ e@@ m to su@@ g@@ g@@ est that they are at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to d@@ el@@ a@@ y the f@@ a@@ i@@ r course of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
the min@@ is@@ ter in ch@@ ar@@ ge , Mr S@@ o@@ k A@@ n , rec@@ ently c@@ la@@ im@@ ed that the gu@@ i@@ d@@ ing principle be@@ h@@ in@@ d this th@@ in@@ king was to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in st@@ ability and peace in the country I@@ n other words , for@@ m@@ er K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge members w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e te@@ st@@ im@@ on@@ y could j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e current st@@ ability , need not be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to t@@ ri@@ al .
K@@ ing S@@ i@@ h@@ an@@ ou@@ k too is taking the un@@ w@@ il@@ l@@ ing authorities under his w@@ ing by pre@@ t@@ en@@ ding that &quot; st@@ ability is more important than re@@ v@@ en@@ ge &quot; .
by way of con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , Mr President , we call on the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity and C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a to ensure that the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge k@@ il@@ l@@ ers are b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to j@@ u@@ st@@ ice in a s@@ p@@ e@@ ed@@ y , f@@ a@@ i@@ r and com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve t@@ ri@@ al , and to pre@@ v@@ ent the t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al from de@@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ating into a ch@@ ar@@ ad@@ e .
Mr President , I believe Mr B@@ el@@ d@@ er has just h@@ it the n@@ a@@ i@@ l on the he@@ a@@ d .
of course it is positive that this t@@ ri@@ al is now actually about to take place .
it is important for C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a to deal with the g@@ h@@ o@@ st@@ s from the past which are still ha@@ un@@ ting the country .
however , we are not w@@ il@@ d about what is about to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en there .
it is a matter of better some of a pu@@ d@@ ding than n@@ one of a p@@ i@@ e .
we cannot do much el@@ se other than go al@@ on@@ g with it .
C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a &apos; s par@@ li@@ a@@ ment has given its con@@ s@@ ent .
who are we then to c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing now , but we do have gra@@ ve d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts about the way in which this has been or@@ g@@ an@@ ised .
firstly , every c@@ ou@@ r@@ t in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a will have di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing its own n@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ ity .
in this case , the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es will be ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an S@@ u@@ pre@@ me Council of M@@ ag@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ c@@ y , which is r@@ ul@@ ed by the g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ing par@@ ty .
how n@@ e@@ u@@ tra@@ l can those j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es be ?
it is , of course , possible to ap@@ point international j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es , and they will certainly pla@@ y a role in this , but will this role be so man@@ i@@ f@@ est that it will be clear to the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s that the j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ments pa@@ s@@ sed will actually be n@@ e@@ u@@ tra@@ l and do j@@ u@@ st@@ ice to the situation as it was then ?
it is , of course , extremely od@@ d that people such as Mr I@@ en@@ g S@@ ary , who pla@@ y@@ ed a key role under P@@ o@@ l P@@ o@@ t , have already been re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d from the t@@ ri@@ al because the P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister dis@@ mis@@ sed them from that t@@ ri@@ al , and that was not done by a c@@ ou@@ r@@ t of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice but by Mr H@@ u@@ n S@@ en .
we are p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that this t@@ ri@@ al is now going to take place , but we will m@@ on@@ it@@ or its progress with con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able su@@ s@@ p@@ ic@@ ion .
we will only be able to re@@ ac@@ h a con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion as to whether what is ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing here is a positive st@@ e@@ p once the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t cases are over .
we therefore hope things will go well , but we have major d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
Mr President , I very much welcome the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts to t@@ r@@ y the su@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts of the for@@ m@@ er C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
it is important so that C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a can mo@@ ve forward into the future that those responsible for he@@ in@@ ous c@@ r@@ im@@ es against the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an population be b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge re@@ g@@ im@@ e was one of the wor@@ st human rights ab@@ u@@ s@@ ers of the t@@ w@@ en@@ ti@@ et@@ h c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y , being responsible for an e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted 1@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 million de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a sh@@ or@@ t , f@@ our @-@ year r@@ u@@ le .
although I welcome the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts I have a number of res@@ er@@ va@@ tions .
we have to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that the members of the r@@ ul@@ ing C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s Party , including the pr@@ im@@ e min@@ is@@ ter , H@@ u@@ n S@@ en , were once ac@@ ti@@ v@@ is@@ t@@ s of the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge , s@@ er@@ v@@ ing under the d@@ ic@@ ta@@ to@@ r P@@ o@@ l P@@ o@@ t .
H@@ u@@ n S@@ en has already dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed who can and cannot be taken before a t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al , th@@ us ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ ing the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers of any c@@ ou@@ r@@ t .
there have been g@@ en@@ u@@ ine fe@@ ar@@ s that se@@ ver@@ al s@@ en@@ i@@ or members of the re@@ g@@ im@@ e might e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ e j@@ u@@ st@@ ice , in particular the for@@ m@@ er K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n se@@ c@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y , I@@ en@@ g S@@ ary .
he was given par@@ ti@@ al a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y after he de@@ f@@ ec@@ ted with about 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 su@@ p@@ por@@ ters in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
I@@ en@@ g S@@ ary and other K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge le@@ ad@@ ers were s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ ed to death in ab@@ s@@ en@@ ti@@ a in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 by the P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos;s Court , which was or@@ g@@ an@@ ised by the V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e ar@@ my o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ p@@ ying C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a at the time .
the a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y g@@ r@@ an@@ ted by K@@ ing S@@ i@@ h@@ an@@ ou@@ k re@@ f@@ ers only to this con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion and makes no re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to future con@@ v@@ ic@@ tions and therefore it is important that he is t@@ ri@@ ed .
no K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge le@@ ad@@ ers has ever been t@@ ri@@ ed and only two are in d@@ et@@ en@@ tion , one being the per@@ s@@ on who r@@ an a no@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ous t@@ or@@ ture c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e in P@@ h@@ no@@ m P@@ en@@ h from which only se@@ v@@ en out of more than f@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ en th@@ ou@@ s@@ and in@@ ma@@ tes em@@ er@@ ged al@@ i@@ ve .
the t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al has an un@@ u@@ su@@ al framework for participation of both international and C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es and pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s .
n@@ or@@ m@@ ally , in other war c@@ r@@ im@@ e c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts , there are only f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es and pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s .
this b@@ ec@@ om@@ es ever more wor@@ r@@ ying when we see that while the UN @-@ n@@ om@@ in@@ ated j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es will be s@@ c@@ re@@ en@@ ed by the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an S@@ u@@ pre@@ me Council of the M@@ ag@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ te , a b@@ od@@ y con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ l@@ ed by the r@@ ul@@ ing par@@ ty of P@@ h@@ no@@ m P@@ en@@ h , the UN has no power w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever to s@@ c@@ re@@ en the j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted by C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
finally , we also need to look at the in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ement of C@@ h@@ in@@ a in all of this .
although it has always ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed that it only pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge with technical ex@@ per@@ t@@ ise in ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ tion c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e rec@@ ently u@@ n@@ e@@ ar@@ th@@ ed e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence to s@@ how that it was di@@ rec@@ tly involved in the se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up of the in@@ ter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation and t@@ or@@ ture c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e in P@@ h@@ no@@ m P@@ en@@ h where th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ans di@@ ed .
Mr President , there are people here who are ol@@ d enough not to have for@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ en the ex@@ tra@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ary and h@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ ing reports that c@@ a@@ me out of C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a in 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 5 , with a@@ er@@ i@@ al p@@ ic@@ t@@ u@@ res of a d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ted c@@ ap@@ it@@ al as the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge , their le@@ ad@@ ers sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ ed in the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent t@@ en@@ et@@ s of French re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary tra@@ d@@ ition and p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ sing a m@@ i@@ x@@ ture of political i@@ d@@ e@@ al@@ is@@ m and ma@@ s@@ s p@@ s@@ y@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , mo@@ v@@ ed two million people from the c@@ ity to the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e to be@@ g@@ in a new society in year z@@ er@@ o under the le@@ ad@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the &quot; great &quot; P@@ o@@ l P@@ o@@ t .
the si@@ c@@ k were d@@ ra@@ g@@ g@@ ed from the h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ als or le@@ f@@ t to di@@ e .
what f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed was to s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ k the world .
the human rights ab@@ u@@ se@@ s of B@@ o@@ s@@ n@@ i@@ a , K@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ v@@ o , S@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ a L@@ e@@ one , C@@ h@@ il@@ e , A@@ n@@ g@@ ol@@ a are d@@ w@@ ar@@ f@@ ed by the sh@@ e@@ er sc@@ al@@ e of the at@@ ro@@ c@@ ities that to@@ o@@ k place under the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge .
the d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ate de@@ a@@ th@@ s of between one and two million people con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ted a real g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e .
perhaps , to be acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te , we should call it a se@@ c@@ to@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e for the in@@ t@@ en@@ tion was not to w@@ i@@ p@@ e out a ra@@ ce but an en@@ ti@@ r@@ e c@@ la@@ s@@ s , with v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted on the basis of whether they were ed@@ u@@ c@@ ated , whether their h@@ an@@ ds s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ed si@@ g@@ n@@ s of man@@ u@@ al work , or even whether they wor@@ e s@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ c@@ l@@ es .
it is not sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing therefore that following P@@ o@@ l P@@ o@@ t &apos;s death and the de@@ fe@@ at of the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge , there should be a need for some kind of national c@@ a@@ th@@ ar@@ si@@ s through the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice and a c@@ al@@ l@@ ing to account of those responsible .
per@@ s@@ on@@ ally I hope that the pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tions will not be re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted to the to@@ p 20 le@@ ad@@ ers but be ex@@ t@@ en@@ ded to those who d@@ a@@ il@@ y b@@ r@@ u@@ t@@ al@@ ised and ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted their v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s .
if the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an people want these t@@ ri@@ als to pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed , and the political situation is su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently st@@ able to per@@ m@@ it them , then it is only natural that the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , through the UN , should wish to support them in that a@@ i@@ m .
we should be@@ w@@ are , however , of im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing j@@ u@@ st@@ ice on other st@@ a@@ tes , especially if such pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s might un@@ ra@@ v@@ e@@ l a political t@@ r@@ u@@ ce or ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ation that has b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t peace or st@@ ability to the region and pr@@ om@@ is@@ es a better future .
a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ ies are s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es necessary if un@@ p@@ al@@ a@@ ta@@ ble .
in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a , though , it l@@ o@@ o@@ ks as though the people and government are re@@ ad@@ y to take the r@@ is@@ k of over@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ ies in order to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
if that pro@@ v@@ es to be the case we should wish them well in this v@@ en@@ ture .
Mr President , it is a positive st@@ e@@ p that the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t law on the t@@ ri@@ al of the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge members in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a has been adopted in the country &apos; s N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly and that K@@ ing S@@ i@@ h@@ an@@ ou@@ k is to si@@ g@@ n it after it has been dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed by the C@@ on@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al Council .
the form the t@@ ri@@ als will take has been agreed between the UN and the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an government .
as the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ i@@ al system is still f@@ ra@@ i@@ l , the t@@ ri@@ als are to be or@@ g@@ an@@ ised in such a way that both international and local j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ es will be p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ing .
during the time of the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge , n@@ e@@ ar@@ ly all those in the country &apos; s legal prof@@ e@@ s@@ sion were k@@ il@@ led , and the country has not had time to e@@ v@@ ol@@ ve a new prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ ally r@@ u@@ n j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ i@@ al system .
the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity has been concerned that many of those f@@ ou@@ n@@ d gu@@ il@@ ty of g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e will not rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve s@@ ent@@ ences , despite the law that su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the t@@ ri@@ al .
this concern is well @-@ f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded .
those who c@@ a@@ u@@ sed the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an state so much d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge and its people so much un@@ s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ a@@ ble su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing must be held le@@ g@@ ally responsible for their actions .
in addition to this , however , account must be taken of the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of st@@ ability and the country &apos; s future .
last s@@ pr@@ ing I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f was able to see how or@@ d@@ in@@ ary people were a@@ im@@ ing at for@@ g@@ i@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , so that life could go on .
it is not always e@@ as@@ y to d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish clearly between the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s and the per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s .
re@@ st@@ ar@@ ting a s@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ l of large @-@ sc@@ al@@ e re@@ v@@ en@@ ge is to be a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ed .
although C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a &apos; s problems and its b@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ y h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y are still c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e to us in terms of time , the country has been able to b@@ u@@ il@@ d the f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations of democracy .
C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a is the only country in S@@ ou@@ th@@ e@@ a@@ st A@@ si@@ a to have ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
a f@@ ri@@ end of min@@ e who wor@@ ks in the region said that at present C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a is the only m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ par@@ ty system in the for@@ m@@ er French In@@ do @-@ C@@ h@@ in@@ a , although there is still much to do to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then democracy and the r@@ u@@ le of law .
while we j@@ o@@ y@@ fully welcome the legislation on a t@@ ri@@ al , we must give our d@@ ed@@ ic@@ ated support to the positive de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments that have st@@ ar@@ ted in the country .
Mr President , what we have just seen is an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to w@@ rec@@ k the T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day s@@ it@@ ting just as F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y &apos;s s@@ it@@ ting as been done a@@ way with , par@@ tly by under@@ min@@ ing these to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent de@@ b@@ a@@ tes .
however , I would like to say that the subject of C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a very much d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the importance of our to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent de@@ b@@ a@@ tes .
as Mr T@@ an@@ no@@ c@@ k has quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly said , the g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e which to@@ o@@ k place in C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a was often h@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ ed up during the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
no one c@@ a@@ re@@ d about C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
it was this House which , following its first di@@ rec@@ t el@@ ec@@ tion in 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 , was the first to give re@@ p@@ res@@ sed p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es a m@@ or@@ al v@@ o@@ ice , although it had v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ ally no p@@ o@@ w@@ ers at that time .
and this House to@@ o@@ k a very special interest in the f@@ ate of the people of C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
I rec@@ all that in the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s our c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e O@@ t@@ t@@ o v@@ on H@@ ab@@ s@@ b@@ ur@@ g , who I was working with at the time , re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly g@@ o@@ t the subject of C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a on@@ to the agenda .
and if the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ ans w@@ an@@ ted to com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ate with the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of Europe , they did it through the European Parliament &apos;s de@@ b@@ a@@ tes on to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance , here in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
a p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an who rec@@ ently di@@ ed , S@@ on S@@ an , a D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at who t@@ ro@@ d the difficult p@@ at@@ h between the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge on the one hand and the pr@@ o @-@ V@@ i@@ et@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ s@@ e pu@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t re@@ g@@ im@@ e on the other , gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally pu@@ sh@@ ed a@@ he@@ a@@ d the r@@ e @-@ e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a , ch@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ ly with the help of the European Union and of the European Parliament .
today we have an opportunity to b@@ u@@ il@@ d on this , and I am very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that the h@@ or@@ ri@@ f@@ ying g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e com@@ m@@ it@@ ted by the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge will now be pro@@ per@@ ly pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
but it is also very positive - and I would like to say that Mrs I@@ i@@ v@@ ar@@ i is quite right here - that we as the European Union have a ch@@ ance to ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y support democracy , the r@@ u@@ le of law and p@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ al@@ ity in m@@ od@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
however , this example should make us aware that it is not always a question of ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te power or a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity .
this House , thank g@@ o@@ od@@ ness , now has greater p@@ o@@ w@@ ers as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds external policy than it had 20 years ago .
it is a question of g@@ i@@ v@@ ing those who are de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ed of their rights a m@@ or@@ al v@@ o@@ ice and that is one of the pr@@ im@@ ary d@@ u@@ ti@@ es of this House .
Mr President , the Commission has fully su@@ p@@ por@@ ted the efforts of the United N@@ ations and the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an authorities in their at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ts to achieve an e@@ ar@@ ly agreement on the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al .
during the past year , the Commission b@@ il@@ a@@ ter@@ ally , and together with the EU Member States , has called on the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an government to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s its support for the process le@@ ad@@ ing up to the agreement on the T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al and has rec@@ al@@ l@@ ed that the T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al should m@@ e@@ e@@ t international st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds of j@@ u@@ st@@ ice , f@@ a@@ ir@@ ness and due process .
after some d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in the pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing of the legislation , the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t law was adopted by the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly on 2 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary and by the S@@ en@@ ate on 1@@ 5 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
it is now due to be ra@@ ti@@ fied by the C@@ on@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al Council and K@@ ing N@@ or@@ od@@ o@@ m S@@ i@@ h@@ an@@ ou@@ k .
while we welcome the ad@@ op@@ tion of the legislation regarding the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al , both by the N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly and by the S@@ en@@ ate , it should be b@@ or@@ n@@ e in mind that we are still a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al st@@ a@@ te@@ ment from the United N@@ ations on the d@@ ra@@ f@@ t te@@ x@@ t .
there are in@@ d@@ ic@@ ations that the te@@ x@@ t is not com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly in line with what had been agreed with the United N@@ ations .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the first re@@ action from the UN after rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing an u@@ no@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al trans@@ la@@ tion , has been c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ou@@ s@@ ly positive , and the Commission h@@ op@@ es , therefore , that the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding issues can be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed so that the UN can improve the new c@@ ou@@ r@@ t and the agreement between the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an government and the United N@@ ations can be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted ex@@ p@@ ed@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
one other ou@@ t@@ st@@ an@@ ding issue which the Commission will follow c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y is the question of which K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge le@@ ad@@ er will be put on t@@ ri@@ al .
although P@@ r@@ im@@ e Minister H@@ u@@ n S@@ en has given as@@ su@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ es that no@@ b@@ od@@ y would be im@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ e from pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion , he has also in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated that this is a very s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve issue for par@@ ts of the C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ an population .
in particular , H@@ u@@ n S@@ en has w@@ ar@@ n@@ ed that &quot; war could b@@ re@@ a@@ k out &quot; if the K@@ h@@ m@@ er R@@ ou@@ ge de@@ pu@@ ty pre@@ m@@ i@@ er I@@ en@@ g S@@ ary is put on t@@ ri@@ al .
so there are very good reasons why we should follow this c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing , at 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
visa re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments between R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a and G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a
the next it@@ e@@ m is the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate on the following mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions :

Mr President , we can certainly support the th@@ r@@ u@@ st of the present resolution .
after all , it is a clear de@@ par@@ ture from the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation &apos; s un@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l decision to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a visa ob@@ li@@ g@@ ation on G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a .

n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t both parties to dis@@ pla@@ y the will to en@@ ter into j@@ o@@ in@@ t con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion .
much more serious , in our opinion , is an om@@ is@@ sion in rec@@ it@@ al D@@ . I@@ t has a di@@ rec@@ t be@@ ar@@ ing on the very e@@ s@@ s@@ ence of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a &apos; s political st@@ ability .
rec@@ it@@ al D is right to re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e safety gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es to be put in place for the group of ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 3@@ 5 000 G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , some of w@@ h@@ o@@ m have now re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ed to the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n region of G@@ al@@ i or com@@ m@@ u@@ te there on a d@@ a@@ il@@ y basis for their work .
the se@@ par@@ at@@ is@@ t A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ an re@@ g@@ im@@ e is today in power in that region but - be@@ a@@ r in mind - this is in the p@@ res@@ ence of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an t@@ ro@@ op@@ s , so @-@ called p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ e@@ per@@ s , who as@@ su@@ me a pu@@ re@@ ly pa@@ s@@ si@@ ve role .
however , what is mis@@ sing in rec@@ it@@ al D , is a re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the large group of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es from A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a who have been on G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y until now .
these are an e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ ted 1@@ 7@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 to 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed per@@ s@@ ons , and they are li@@ v@@ ing in t@@ r@@ u@@ ly ab@@ j@@ ec@@ t conditions .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y this specific h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an problem which p@@ o@@ ses a di@@ rec@@ t th@@ re@@ at to the a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity of President S@@ he@@ v@@ ar@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ e .
these d@@ a@@ y@@ s , the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es from A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a are pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the th@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ s@@ c@@ re@@ ws on G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an authorities to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e their re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n h@@ om@@ e .
in sh@@ or@@ t , they are a con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ous s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce of un@@ re@@ st in G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a .
a situation which R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a is ap@@ par@@ ently k@@ e@@ en to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in by not for@@ c@@ ing A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a to accept a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion for these re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
indeed , various s@@ ch@@ em@@ es have been ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed under international su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on which the A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ ans have so far put on h@@ ol@@ d .
given these and other h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly v@@ ol@@ a@@ ti@@ le political s@@ it@@ u@@ ations in the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s , we welcome the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion in P@@ ar@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 8 - the ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment of a special European en@@ v@@ o@@ y to this st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ ic@@ ally and ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic@@ ally important region - with open ar@@ m@@ s .
a w@@ at@@ ch@@ ful European e@@ y@@ e may have a pre@@ v@@ en@@ tive effect on this h@@ o@@ t@@ b@@ ed , and what is more , our p@@ res@@ ence will h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly promote internal com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with for@@ m@@ ally si@@ g@@ n@@ ed f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l rights .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have had to w@@ a@@ it a long time to get this resolution on the agenda .
G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a is a long way a@@ way , it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e , and a few years ago , the Balkans se@@ em@@ ed just as far a@@ way .
we have now seen the ou@@ t@@ come of that situation and just how c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e they are in fact .
I think that , in many res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts , G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a and the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s as a whole already are today what the Balkans were y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , the Balkans of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0@@ s .
C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , K@@ ar@@ ab@@ a@@ k@@ h , A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a , S@@ ou@@ th O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a and G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a as a whole are very f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing tra@@ g@@ i@@ c s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a today is a country l@@ it@@ er@@ ally in the st@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ le@@ h@@ ol@@ d of its l@@ ar@@ g@@ er n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our , a country being b@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ ma@@ il@@ ed through the o@@ i@@ l su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , the g@@ as su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , the el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , b@@ la@@ c@@ k@@ ma@@ il@@ ed through v@@ is@@ as , with this un@@ b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ va@@ ble dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation between the citizens of S@@ ou@@ th O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a and A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a and those of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a .
this situation is the work of M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w , the new im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c policy pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by President P@@ u@@ t@@ in .
G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a is s@@ in@@ king f@@ a@@ st , p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty is b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d and the European Union , if you will ex@@ c@@ use the l@@ an@@ gu@@ age , does not give a d@@ a@@ m@@ n , either about G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a , or about this new f@@ o@@ c@@ us of conflict at the very g@@ a@@ te@@ way to Europe .
no s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions are con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ la@@ ted , although I do not see why it should not be per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly possible , in a European Union which will have 4@@ 5@@ 0 million members , to have 4@@ 5@@ 5 million .
the only s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion which might st@@ ab@@ il@@ ise the whole region , right on C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a &apos; s d@@ o@@ or@@ st@@ e@@ p , and put a b@@ ra@@ k@@ e on R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a &apos; s h@@ ol@@ d in this region , the only serious proposal , by which I mean a proposal that G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a should acc@@ ed@@ e to the European Union in due form , has not been made .
we ou@@ g@@ h@@ t at least to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that the European Union must , as a matter of ur@@ g@@ ency , v@@ is@@ it C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a . this in@@ v@@ it@@ ation is particularly di@@ rec@@ ted at Commissioner P@@ ou@@ l N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on .
Mr President , Commissioner , he who s@@ o@@ ws the w@@ in@@ d shall in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly re@@ a@@ p the w@@ h@@ ir@@ l@@ w@@ in@@ d .
these words take on their full m@@ e@@ an@@ ing when ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed to the countries of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s .
what region of our own con@@ t@@ in@@ ent , or the next , is more c@@ ro@@ s@@ sed by t@@ en@@ si@@ ons and issues ?
what region has a greater need for pa@@ c@@ i@@ fication and n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ is@@ ation ?
the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s is e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y c@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t in the p@@ in@@ c@@ er g@@ ri@@ p of regional p@@ o@@ w@@ ers - R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a and Turkey , of con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts of interest , and h@@ ence re@@ la@@ ted military con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts , from the N@@ ag@@ or@@ no K@@ ar@@ ab@@ a@@ k@@ h pla@@ te@@ a@@ u to the m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in@@ s of C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , or the regions of A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a and S@@ ou@@ th O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a .
the region is st@@ ag@@ n@@ ating , o@@ s@@ si@@ fied in political , economic and energy trans@@ ition pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses which continue to ex@@ is@@ t only in th@@ e@@ or@@ y .
a situation which has until now been held in a v@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ tive st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o , which may be con@@ si@@ de@@ red n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s as the l@@ e@@ s@@ se@@ r e@@ v@@ i@@ l .
at least , e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing was done to de@@ f@@ u@@ se the different j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ations for war in the framework of an a@@ d h@@ o@@ c st@@ ability agreement .
at least the recent in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ation of these three countries , as small g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ic@@ ally as they are st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ ally , into the Council of Europe could be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted as a si@@ g@@ n of interest from the n@@ ations of Europe , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing hope of n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ is@@ ation for the region and a guarantee of a more f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble future for these p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es .
how , then , is the recent un@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l decision by the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an Government to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a visa re@@ g@@ im@@ e for the citizens of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a to be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t as d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ate o@@ st@@ ra@@ c@@ is@@ m se@@ ver@@ ing economic trade and h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ic l@@ in@@ ks between the for@@ m@@ er@@ ly f@@ ra@@ ter@@ n@@ al S@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ e@@ t st@@ a@@ tes .
how is this ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive se@@ g@@ re@@ g@@ ation between the citizens of the same country , which is rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised by the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , the people of A@@ b@@ k@@ ha@@ z@@ i@@ a , S@@ ou@@ th O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a and T@@ b@@ il@@ is@@ i , to be in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ted ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t as o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al external ra@@ ti@@ fication over@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ing the in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity of a s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n state ?
indeed , is a government b@@ il@@ l tabled in the D@@ u@@ m@@ a to provide for the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of an@@ n@@ e@@ x@@ ing a f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n state , or part th@@ e@@ re@@ of , even if there are no b@@ or@@ d@@ ers ?
these are just so many d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ ate , c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ted s@@ al@@ l@@ ies in R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a &apos; s m@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ led g@@ e@@ op@@ ol@@ it@@ ical g@@ a@@ me , and just as many reasons for us to use our v@@ o@@ tes to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation of R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a &apos; s ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ations in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing its for@@ m@@ er va@@ s@@ sa@@ l state and to take p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al action to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the political st@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ ation of this region and its economic take @-@ o@@ f@@ f , and , of course , to ap@@ point , as the resolution pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses , a S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ al E@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ y for the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s : since a gu@@ st of w@@ in@@ d in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s may indeed b@@ l@@ o@@ w Europe a@@ way .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament &apos;s d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation for relations with the S@@ ou@@ th C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly concerned about the d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c e@@ v@@ ents currently being en@@ ac@@ ted there .
the un@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l im@@ position of a visa re@@ g@@ im@@ e on G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a , with the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tion of two regions of G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a , will c@@ re@@ ate new di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in a country which is a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the Council of Europe , w@@ is@@ h@@ es to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c@@ ally , and with which we have con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded an agreement p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y in order to support it in all areas .
these de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments are le@@ ad@@ ing to t@@ en@@ si@@ ons with n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ ing st@@ a@@ tes and to h@@ u@@ ge ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es for the G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ ans themselves , some of w@@ h@@ o@@ m work in the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation and are now ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ing di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
in order to ob@@ ta@@ in a visa , they have to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l back to T@@ i@@ f@@ l@@ is .
in some cases they cannot even a@@ f@@ for@@ d to do this .
and the other si@@ d@@ e is that these dis@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tions will also have economic consequences .
we are very much concerned that because of its o@@ i@@ l res@@ er@@ v@@ es the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e S@@ ou@@ th C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s is now at the m@@ er@@ c@@ y of com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al interests and has also become a European t@@ r@@ ou@@ ble s@@ p@@ o@@ t .
we should not just w@@ r@@ ing our h@@ an@@ ds about this , we should actually do e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing in our power .
we know from our G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds in national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments and from the em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y , which has con@@ ta@@ c@@ ted us , that they really are in di@@ r@@ e st@@ ra@@ its , and that they fe@@ a@@ r further de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments , especially as a w@@ ed@@ ge is being d@@ ri@@ v@@ en between A@@ r@@ m@@ en@@ i@@ a and A@@ z@@ er@@ b@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ an , which M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ently re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds as greater f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds .
G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a fe@@ ar@@ s that it will become is@@ ol@@ ated .
so these are t@@ r@@ u@@ ly d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c e@@ v@@ ents .
at the end of December , g@@ as p@@ i@@ p@@ el@@ in@@ es from R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a to G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a were even b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ed on the al@@ le@@ g@@ ed g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds that pa@@ y@@ ments had not been made , even though the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents were quite different .
so these are all things which when ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed l@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally s@@ ou@@ n@@ d quite h@@ ar@@ m@@ less , but which d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ te to us that the situation has d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fied over the last si@@ x m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
we are therefore as@@ king the Commission to consider , in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with the Council , whether we could not re@@ view and work out a better approach to these conflict s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , based on appropriate decisions which will help people there who want to b@@ u@@ il@@ d a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c society and se@@ e@@ k a p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful future , and to support G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a in ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ing human rights and com@@ pl@@ ying with the other ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations it has en@@ te@@ red into within the Council of Europe .
it is very h@@ ar@@ d in these difficult c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es for G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve all its current human rights ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations .
that is why we are c@@ al@@ l@@ ing on the Commission to ac@@ t here .
we have made re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s and have l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ par@@ ty agreement in Parliament that something should be done .
we need to work together to come up with s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions which will promote a p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful way forward .
Mr President , I would like to f@@ ir@@ m@@ ly support Mrs S@@ ch@@ le@@ ic@@ her , who has wor@@ k@@ ed with great commitment on behalf of the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ an region and in this case G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a in particular .
we all know what these re@@ pr@@ is@@ als are about .
on the one hand they are l@@ in@@ k@@ ed with g@@ e@@ o @-@ st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c interests and with energy and o@@ i@@ l interests , and on the other hand they are as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with the b@@ r@@ u@@ ta@@ l war being w@@ ag@@ ed to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate the people of C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
it is very clear to us what is being at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ted here - to d@@ e@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ ise G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a , just as C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a has been d@@ e@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ ised .
we all have an interest in p@@ res@@ er@@ v@@ ing what is in any case very f@@ ra@@ g@@ il@@ e n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ d and in su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the first f@@ al@@ ter@@ ing st@@ e@@ p@@ s towards democracy in this region and in G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a .
that is why I would like to call on the Commissioner to pa@@ y even greater attention to this region .
h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid in particular has a st@@ r@@ on@@ g st@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ ing effect in addition to its pu@@ re@@ ly h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an f@@ un@@ c@@ tion .
I am d@@ el@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ted that a d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation from our n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s , the P@@ ar@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly of the Council of Europe , is currently v@@ is@@ it@@ ing C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , and I wish to ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the Commissioner to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l to G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a and C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future and have a c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e look at the human rights situation there on the s@@ p@@ o@@ t , just as the Council of Europe is doing in such a th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h way .
I ap@@ p@@ e@@ al to the Commissioner to make our h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid the number one political priority - the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ an region has been a priority for the U@@ S@@ A and for R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a for a long time . I say this because I have the fe@@ el@@ ing that the European Union , a@@ part from Mrs S@@ ch@@ le@@ ic@@ her , who is doing mar@@ v@@ el@@ l@@ ous work , is f@@ a@@ il@@ ing to take up this ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge .
we must not allow ourselves to re@@ p@@ e@@ at the mis@@ take we made with the Balkans , where we also w@@ o@@ k@@ e up to the situation too late , and again att@@ ra@@ c@@ t op@@ pro@@ b@@ ri@@ u@@ m by doing too little too late .
Mr President , I wish to be@@ g@@ in by sa@@ ying a few words about h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance to this region .
we are the s@@ in@@ g@@ le most important pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ er of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance to the n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s and , over the years , we have also been the main pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ er of h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance to the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s region .
a year ago ex@@ ac@@ tly I was in North O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a and I t@@ ri@@ ed to get into C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a but the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an authorities would not allow this for security reasons .
but we are still there .
right now our b@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ est problem is the ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of the men who wor@@ k@@ ed for one of the organisations we are funding in C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
this , of course , has c@@ a@@ u@@ sed a great deal of concern .
the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate re@@ action was to w@@ i@@ th@@ draw from C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a .
however , many organisations in R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a have ur@@ g@@ ed us to re@@ consider this and to come back .
as a h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ er this pu@@ ts us in a d@@ il@@ em@@ m@@ a .
on the one hand , we need to be there , and we are very p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d that Parliament under@@ st@@ an@@ ds the need for E@@ C@@ H@@ O to op@@ er@@ ate on the basis of a &quot; re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e control op@@ er@@ ation &quot; in these c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es .
on the other hand , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es it is a little too e@@ as@@ y for us to te@@ l@@ l the organisations we are funding to go there - it is the v@@ ol@@ un@@ ta@@ r@@ y st@@ a@@ f@@ f who have to go .
we have to find a b@@ al@@ ance that is e@@ th@@ ic@@ ally acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble as a d@@ on@@ or .
at the moment we are re@@ con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing whether or not to go back to C@@ h@@ ec@@ h@@ n@@ y@@ a , as we are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed there .
let me t@@ u@@ r@@ n to G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a .
the EU has already ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed serious concern over the R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation &apos;s un@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l decision to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce visa re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments for G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an citizens .
the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity , including R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a , is com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to su@@ p@@ por@@ ting the s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty and ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity of the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent st@@ a@@ tes .
ap@@ pl@@ ying a special visa re@@ g@@ im@@ e or al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing ex@@ em@@ p@@ tions for the in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of se@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ is@@ t regions could im@@ p@@ ly support for the le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ c@@ y of their re@@ g@@ im@@ es and under@@ min@@ e G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a &apos;s s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty and ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity .
in addition to the in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion of visa re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments , G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a has f@@ ac@@ ed a number of other c@@ r@@ is@@ es in its relations with R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a in recent m@@ on@@ th@@ s , in particular , over in@@ ter@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tions in g@@ as su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ es , the pa@@ ce of w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ al of military b@@ a@@ se@@ s and res@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ing dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons with the P@@ ar@@ is C@@ l@@ u@@ b .
concerning R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an g@@ as su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ es to G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a , we ur@@ ge that all actions are based ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y on com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al and con@@ tra@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ al con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ations .
I want to st@@ res@@ s that it is in R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a &apos;s interests to be seen as an in@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ally c@@ re@@ di@@ ble and re@@ li@@ able g@@ as su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ er .
I say this as a European .
we are n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally concerned about the h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an , social and economic consequences for the G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ an people , as well as the over@@ all st@@ ability in the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s .
R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ a too has no interest in se@@ e@@ ing in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d in@@ st@@ ability in the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ su@@ s .
G@@ e@@ or@@ g@@ i@@ a is a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the UN , the O@@ S@@ C@@ E and the Council of Europe and it has a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p and cooperation agreement with the EU .
it d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es our support .
we call upon the st@@ a@@ tes of the region to use the m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s of the O@@ S@@ C@@ E , as well as any other appropriate p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , to res@@ ol@@ ve that dis@@ pu@@ te qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on at 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .

the next it@@ e@@ m is the j@@ o@@ in@@ t debate on the following mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions :

situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons
( it ) Mr President , one year after H@@ el@@ s@@ in@@ k@@ i we have been following e@@ v@@ ents in Turkey with an@@ gu@@ ish and ap@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion . th@@ ir@@ ty @-@ three people were k@@ il@@ led when the security for@@ c@@ es in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ed on 1@@ 9 December , and what n@@ e@@ ws is available on the state of health of those de@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ es for@@ c@@ i@@ b@@ ly trans@@ f@@ er@@ red who have been on h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e since 20 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er last , re@@ ma@@ in@@ s al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
and we can only con@@ d@@ em@@ n the c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n of s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c re@@ p@@ res@@ sion and the b@@ an on any ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion of support for the pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , which has ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted human rights organisations in the first in@@ st@@ ance .
we are well aware that the situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons means we cannot i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ e the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence and in@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ g@@ ence of certain pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers and the fact that , in some cases , the Turkish authorities had l@@ o@@ s@@ t control of whole se@@ c@@ tions of the pr@@ is@@ ons , as well as the con@@ st@@ ant reports from various a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ a@@ ti@@ ve s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es of su@@ m@@ mar@@ y ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tions of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers who have t@@ ri@@ ed to de@@ ta@@ ch themselves from the organisations they b@@ el@@ on@@ g to , and l@@ o@@ t@@ s being d@@ ra@@ w@@ n to s@@ el@@ ec@@ t which pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers are to f@@ a@@ st until death .
but it has been d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted that the Turkish government is in@@ c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of en@@ sur@@ ing peace and security in the pr@@ is@@ ons without the ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve and in@@ effective use of force , so it is the Turkish government that be@@ ar@@ s pr@@ im@@ e responsibility for what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed and it must find the re@@ m@@ ed@@ y for it .
the re@@ m@@ ed@@ y cannot be b@@ l@@ in@@ d re@@ p@@ res@@ sion and par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ a about security .
it is the Turkish government &apos; s d@@ u@@ ty to pre@@ v@@ ent an already t@@ en@@ se situation taking ro@@ o@@ t and de@@ e@@ pen@@ ing into h@@ op@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , bo@@ o@@ st@@ ing and st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent and ex@@ t@@ re@@ mis@@ t groups and parties .
it is up to the government to ac@@ t .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly the European Union , like all of us , has a di@@ rec@@ t interest in a process of st@@ ab@@ il@@ is@@ ation and peace , and we hope it will be ra@@ p@@ i@@ d .
we have the clear d@@ u@@ ty to report and e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate any progress towards greater respect for human rights in Turkey , which is why our group st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the idea of s@@ en@@ ding a d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation into the Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons as s@@ o@@ on as possible .
Mr President , the recent e@@ v@@ ents in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons are tra@@ g@@ i@@ c by any st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds and it is an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous p@@ ity that the situation had been al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ate over such a long per@@ i@@ o@@ d with the al@@ most in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able consequences .
however , these e@@ v@@ ents must be put in context and we should ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge the res@@ ol@@ ve of the Turkish authorities to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a more human , acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble , and indeed con@@ t@@ r@@ ol@@ la@@ ble , pr@@ is@@ on re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
as relations between the European Union and Turkey de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p in an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly positive m@@ an@@ n@@ er , we need to take a m@@ e@@ a@@ su@@ red approach in our com@@ ments on Turkey &apos;s problems .
at the same time our re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the Turkish authorities should be su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently ro@@ b@@ u@@ st that we can make j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ able c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s .
I have to say that in the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m in the past we too have had di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es in ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the right pr@@ is@@ on re@@ g@@ im@@ e for those con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted or de@@ ta@@ in@@ ed for ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t o@@ f@@ f@@ ences .
we too have had s@@ it@@ u@@ ations where ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s have more or less had to@@ ta@@ l control over their ac@@ com@@ m@@ od@@ ation and rec@@ re@@ ation areas and we too have had to deal with the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y of h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es .
it is not e@@ as@@ y .
the pr@@ is@@ ons themselves take on s@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ ic si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance .
the situation in the pr@@ is@@ ons b@@ ec@@ om@@ es yet another f@@ ac@@ e@@ t of the ar@@ m@@ ed st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le against the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed government .
we should k@@ e@@ e@@ p this per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive in mind .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing to the resolution itself we ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly de@@ pl@@ or@@ e recent e@@ v@@ ents but my fe@@ el@@ ing is that we should be more w@@ el@@ com@@ ing and en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ing concerning the re@@ for@@ m@@ s in@@ it@@ i@@ ated by the Turkish Government .
after all Turkey is res@@ p@@ on@@ ding to the d@@ em@@ an@@ ds that we pla@@ c@@ ed upon her to bring her pr@@ is@@ ons more into line with European systems .
we should re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that many of the in@@ ma@@ tes are re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ar@@ ies who will accept nothing sh@@ or@@ t of control of their situation .
of course a pr@@ is@@ on re@@ g@@ im@@ e must be h@@ u@@ man@@ e and there must be m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s to en@@ able pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te g@@ ri@@ e@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ es .
this is in everyone &apos;s interests but we cannot ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t governments to n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate with pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers over their conditions and re@@ g@@ im@@ es .
the current problems st@@ ar@@ ted because the ar@@ m@@ ed groups were not pre@@ pa@@ red to con@@ c@@ ed@@ e control over the pr@@ is@@ ons to the authorities .
the res@@ p@@ on@@ se by the security for@@ c@@ es is not the cause but the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of the problem .
the Turkish security for@@ c@@ es had to re@@ take the pr@@ is@@ ons by force f@@ ac@@ ing or@@ g@@ an@@ ised ar@@ m@@ ed op@@ position and the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of many de@@ a@@ th@@ s is not clear while of course every death is a tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y .
I know that the Turkish authorities are g@@ re@@ at@@ ly sa@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ed by recent e@@ v@@ ents .
they are also th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to reform and open to c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e cooperation with the Commission and with the Union and its Member States on reform of the pen@@ al system .
they see this as part of the natural process of ad@@ op@@ ting the ac@@ qu@@ is .
we should ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our concern at what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed and that the situation was al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ate so far .
let us now o@@ f@@ f@@ er all possible prof@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ al ad@@ v@@ ice and assistance and encourage ra@@ p@@ i@@ d reform without g@@ i@@ v@@ ing further opportunities to un@@ d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c for@@ c@@ es who se@@ e@@ k to over@@ th@@ ro@@ w the Turkish Government and f@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ te Turkey &apos;s progress towards m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the European Union .
Mr President , I would say to Mr V@@ an O@@ r@@ d@@ en : you had to re@@ le@@ a@@ se your own I@@ r@@ ish political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers al@@ most with military h@@ on@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
I re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er the sc@@ en@@ es on the B@@ B@@ C .
these are problems which cannot be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed by v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence but only by political s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions .
Mr President , today &apos;s debate and su@@ b@@ se@@ qu@@ ent vote follow on from the debate which we held in this House on 1@@ 4 December last year , when the ur@@ g@@ ent vote was c@@ an@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ed following the decision by the three political groups to w@@ i@@ th@@ draw their mo@@ tions .
that decision was a g@@ e@@ st@@ ur@@ e of con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence on the part of the European Parliament in the will and the ability of the Turkish authorities to man@@ age the h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e crisis in a non @-@ v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent , h@@ u@@ man@@ e and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
in fact , the motion for a resolution by our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w members in the li@@ b@@ er@@ al group , which is si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by the h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble Mr D@@ u@@ f@@ f , st@@ a@@ tes that Parliament is sa@@ t@@ is@@ fied with the Turkish government &apos;s decision to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one its pl@@ ans to trans@@ f@@ er pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers to these pr@@ is@@ ons and to ob@@ ta@@ in the society &apos;s con@@ s@@ ent to the reform of the pr@@ is@@ on system .
si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r h@@ op@@ es were ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in the resolution of the group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by Mr C@@ o@@ h@@ n @-@ B@@ en@@ d@@ it , which qu@@ o@@ ted st@@ a@@ te@@ ments made by the Turkish Minister of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
some members may have been w@@ on over by the ar@@ gu@@ ments set out in the le@@ t@@ ter on the matter from H@@ is E@@ x@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ency the A@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or of Turkey , who again did us the h@@ on@@ our of s@@ en@@ ding us what is now his c@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ ary le@@ t@@ ter in such cases , in which he st@@ res@@ sed that the Turkish government was h@@ an@@ d@@ ling the matter with the u@@ t@@ most s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness and that Parliament n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to le@@ a@@ ve su@@ per@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al@@ ities to one si@@ d@@ e when de@@ al@@ ing with matters as important as the pr@@ is@@ on system in Turkey .
in the w@@ a@@ k@@ e of all of which , h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble members , how tra@@ g@@ i@@ c that the su@@ per@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al@@ ity of the European Parliament has pro@@ v@@ en , in this case at least , to be c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the mar@@ k than the s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness and political ma@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ity of the Turkish authorities .
as you know , a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s la@@ ter , on 20 December , ar@@ my and p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons w@@ ent on the at@@ ta@@ c@@ k in order , n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , to sa@@ ve the pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers &apos; li@@ v@@ es , as the Turkish a@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or in@@ for@@ m@@ s us in another le@@ t@@ ter . t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ f@@ our pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers were k@@ il@@ led and 1@@ 3@@ 1 were w@@ ou@@ n@@ ded during this at@@ ta@@ c@@ k .
and , of course , three Turkish s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers also di@@ ed .
and what is the u@@ p@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of all this b@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ sh@@ ed ?
the h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e in the Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing on a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve sc@@ al@@ e , making it im@@ possible to ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of more at@@ ta@@ c@@ ks , more de@@ a@@ th@@ s and more b@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ sh@@ ed .
our j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ s the need to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d further tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y and therefore c@@ al@@ l@@ s on the Turkish government to take im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate non @-@ v@@ i@@ ol@@ ent measures to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d any such de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments .
that is our main d@@ em@@ and .
of course , what we also need is an objective in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y with international gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es and for responsibility to be ap@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ ed for what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed on 20 December .
I think we also need the situation to be ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed with the assistance and under the su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the European Union .
I t@@ al@@ k of su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on because Turkey is , of course , a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate country and its c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ ture must m@@ e@@ e@@ t the C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ g@@ en c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , which are d@@ a@@ ma@@ ged by such in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents , in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ents which , of course , are rec@@ or@@ d@@ ed by us and , I as@@ su@@ me , by the Commission , which is called on in our resolution to s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally m@@ en@@ tion the situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons in its an@@ n@@ u@@ al report .
these are , I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say , the st@@ u@@ b@@ b@@ or@@ n f@@ ac@@ ts and they are not c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed by the over@@ be@@ ar@@ ing , not to say in@@ su@@ l@@ ting t@@ one of the ad@@ v@@ ice m@@ e@@ ted out by Turkey &apos;s re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es to the European Parliament .
Mr President , it really is v@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ ally p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ less to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s how Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons should be or@@ g@@ an@@ ised .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , I received a great deal of ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al from the Turkish d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation of the Parliament de@@ al@@ ing p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y with the internal conditions in these pr@@ is@@ ons .
I do not think , however , that the problems we are b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing are about the good or b@@ a@@ d t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of o@@ f@@ f@@ en@@ d@@ ers .
a great many of the pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkish j@@ a@@ il@@ s are , after all , con@@ v@@ ic@@ ted for political o@@ f@@ f@@ ences .
it st@@ an@@ ds to reason that they will continue their political st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le as political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
in this way , the efforts of the Turkish Government in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing military t@@ ro@@ op@@ s and re@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve measures also b@@ ec@@ om@@ es part of a political b@@ att@@ le di@@ rec@@ ted against the K@@ ur@@ ds and other min@@ or@@ ities that p@@ op@@ u@@ late the Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons .
the situation is to@@ t@@ ally im@@ possible for Turkish society and the Turkish Government .
a to@@ t@@ ally different approach must be taken .
the political parties and the p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r mo@@ v@@ em@@ ents in Turkey must be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to op@@ er@@ ate as f@@ re@@ el@@ y as parties and mo@@ v@@ em@@ ents in the re@@ st of Europe .
the b@@ att@@ le between different for@@ c@@ es must be f@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t by p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful means .
as long as that is not ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing , I cannot see how there would be any p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of Turkey &apos; s b@@ ec@@ om@@ ing a Member of the European Union .
the Turkish Government must s@@ how the way .
it must be acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted that Turkey con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s of different national and cultural groups which must all have the same rights .
l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es and c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res must be acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted in the sc@@ h@@ o@@ ol@@ s , especially in the K@@ ur@@ d @-@ d@@ om@@ in@@ ated areas .
I believe that the only th@@ ing that can be done is to g@@ r@@ an@@ t a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y to these political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers and to re@@ le@@ a@@ se them from j@@ a@@ i@@ l .
when this ha@@ p@@ pen@@ s , there will be no more problems in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons than in E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ is@@ h , G@@ er@@ m@@ an or French pr@@ is@@ ons .
Mr President , when a debate on the un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble situation in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons was s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed during the last pl@@ en@@ ary se@@ s@@ sion of the European Parliament in December 2000 , and the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant mo@@ tions for res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions were w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n due to a lack of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation between the political groups involved , the dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ance in the Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons was still in its in@@ f@@ an@@ c@@ y and the re@@ action of the Turkish authorities had not yet man@@ i@@ f@@ e@@ st@@ ed itself in all its b@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ ity .
of course , for a less pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c country than Turkey , the very fact that the European Parliament in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to take an interest in the matter would be in@@ c@@ en@@ tive enough to put a st@@ o@@ p to any th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t of v@@ i@@ ol@@ ating its legal and m@@ or@@ al ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations .
Turkey , however , did ex@@ ac@@ tly the op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite , con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing yet again that it is indeed a pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c country .
it b@@ la@@ t@@ an@@ tly and dis@@ d@@ a@@ in@@ fully i@@ g@@ no@@ red the Parliament of the European Union , which it n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s as@@ p@@ i@@ res to j@@ o@@ in and , ap@@ pl@@ ying its f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ ite st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d practice , en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed just a few d@@ a@@ y@@ s la@@ ter in the s@@ ha@@ m@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s s@@ la@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ter of d@@ o@@ z@@ en@@ s of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , pro@@ v@@ o@@ king an international ou@@ t@@ c@@ r@@ y .
today &apos;s con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ y - and in my view ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y l@@ en@@ i@@ ent - resolution is , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous and a positive al@@ be@@ it , unfortunately , in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate re@@ action in the case of Turkey , which has re@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ te@@ d@@ ly pro@@ v@@ en that it is in@@ different to such re@@ pr@@ im@@ an@@ ds .
so what we need , at long last , is for the European Union and the w@@ i@@ d@@ er international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity to deal with Turkey - in de@@ ed not just wor@@ d - using the same w@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ts and measures and the same rules as those used in si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c cases in order to im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e respect for d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , human rights and the r@@ u@@ le of law , i@@ .@@ e@@ . without p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ing ex@@ p@@ ed@@ i@@ ent political and other action and interests and without s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ing t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of so @-@ called Turkish i@@ d@@ i@@ o@@ s@@ y@@ n@@ c@@ ra@@ si@@ es .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it really is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing that we find ourselves ob@@ li@@ ged to ad@@ d@@ res@@ s the situation in Turkey - or rather the situation in that country &apos;s pr@@ is@@ ons - again and so s@@ o@@ on .
I would be p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d if we were able to give Turkey c@@ re@@ d@@ it today for having s@@ ol@@ v@@ ed a difficult situation in a p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful way .
but unfortunately we cannot .
we in the European Parliament must therefore d@@ em@@ and that Turkey itself should in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ate - and where necessary that the Commission should also do its share in in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ating - how this dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ou@@ s situation has ar@@ is@@ en in Turkey at all . I have in mind not only its pr@@ is@@ ons and the h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e there , but also how the need ar@@ o@@ s@@ e for military and p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion at the c@@ o@@ s@@ t of so many li@@ v@@ es .
secondly , we must d@@ em@@ and in no un@@ certain terms that there should be transparency in the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , and that pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers should have the right to see d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s , and not just under the su@@ per@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on of p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e and pr@@ is@@ on o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ers , but also in c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es such that the d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s can g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out serious ex@@ a@@ m@@ in@@ ations with pro@@ per results .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we must d@@ em@@ and that Turkey should at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to re@@ ac@@ h a con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s within its b@@ or@@ d@@ ers , in particular with human rights organisations and in relation to the human rights situation in pr@@ is@@ ons , and that it should consider how the situation can be im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed and a b@@ a@@ si@@ c con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s can be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in this respect .
F@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ly , those in@@ ma@@ tes who are currently being held as political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers under ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing and de@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ t la@@ ws - and it is often ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted in Turkey that there are such pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers - should be re@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d .
this would certainly de@@ f@@ u@@ se the situation in over@@ c@@ ro@@ w@@ ded pr@@ is@@ ons .
F@@ i@@ f@@ th@@ ly , we must d@@ em@@ and a change in Turkey &apos;s la@@ ws .
after all , it is not just a question of sa@@ ying that once they are de@@ ta@@ in@@ ed , pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers should be pro@@ per@@ ly t@@ re@@ ated and that when there is a h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e an at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t should be made to res@@ ol@@ ve the situation p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly .
the real question is why there are so many people in pr@@ is@@ on .
the reason that there are so many people in pr@@ is@@ on is that there are la@@ ws which provide for people to be pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed because of their con@@ v@@ ic@@ tions , which may also find ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion through w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations or st@@ a@@ te@@ ments , rather than pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ing them for ac@@ t@@ u@@ al ac@@ ts which they have com@@ m@@ it@@ ted .
this is simply un@@ acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble in a m@@ od@@ er@@ n democracy .
with that in mind , Mr President , I wish to ap@@ p@@ e@@ al once more to Turkey to finally el@@ im@@ in@@ ate these la@@ ws from its pen@@ al c@@ od@@ e and to st@@ o@@ p in@@ c@@ ar@@ c@@ er@@ ating political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
Mr President , I should like to start , on behalf of the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and the G@@ re@@ e@@ k people in general , by ex@@ p@@ res@@ sing our s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity both with the political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkey and with all the Turkish people who su@@ f@@ f@@ er under the Turkish re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
I should then like to point out that every c@@ r@@ im@@ e has its per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s and its acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies .
there are those who com@@ m@@ it the c@@ r@@ im@@ e and there are those who aid and ab@@ e@@ t .
the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ to@@ r here is , of course , the Turkish re@@ g@@ im@@ e which , a p@@ ri@@ or@@ i , se@@ es every le@@ f@@ t @-@ w@@ in@@ g@@ er , every C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t and every K@@ ur@@ d as a ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t , w@@ h@@ o@@ m it then t@@ ri@@ es to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate .
the acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies , however , are more serious ; they are the international im@@ per@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t system , the United States , Í@@ Á@@ Ô@@ Ï and the European Union , all of which have t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ous economic , st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c and political interests in Turkey and are using all possible means to support the m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ is@@ ti@@ c re@@ g@@ im@@ e in Turkey , the re@@ g@@ im@@ e which has no qu@@ al@@ m@@ s about op@@ en@@ ing f@@ ir@@ e , because what we had here was not in fact a case of political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers se@@ t@@ t@@ ing themselves on f@@ ir@@ e ; it was a case of their being k@@ il@@ led with f@@ la@@ m@@ e@@ th@@ ro@@ w@@ ers .
so these acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies need to be s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ ed , the acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies who g@@ r@@ an@@ ted Turkey c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s , the acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or@@ ies who do nothing to help the political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
we i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied the problem back in A@@ u@@ gu@@ st , we as@@ k@@ ed on more than two o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons for the p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the European Parliament to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e - and nothing was done - and the last time we called for in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion was when the at@@ ta@@ c@@ k had already been carried out - and again nothing was done .
I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d that the resolution before us is very w@@ e@@ a@@ k , it b@@ a@@ re@@ ly even con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ s the action by the Turkish re@@ g@@ im@@ e ; more im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , it does not con@@ d@@ em@@ n those who are be@@ h@@ in@@ d the Turkish re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
it would , of course , be st@@ r@@ an@@ ge if those who y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d@@ ed the war c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al J@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ er S@@ ol@@ an@@ a were to take a different att@@ it@@ u@@ de towards Turkey .
Mr President , the res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions of three political groups were w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n during the last part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion under ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ e c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es and today we are de@@ b@@ ating a j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution by fi@@ ve groups on the same subject .
this is not the time to as@@ se@@ s@@ s what has ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed and what has ch@@ an@@ g@@ ed and what we perhaps en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged with our att@@ it@@ u@@ de .
Turkey is a c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate country for m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p of the European Union .
however , there is e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of d@@ ou@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k on se@@ ver@@ al c@@ ou@@ n@@ ts and the matter is very serious .
I per@@ s@@ on@@ ally am in favour of Turkey &apos;s European pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts .
however , we have no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed - even rec@@ ently - that people who have pla@@ y@@ ed and who still pla@@ y an important role in European de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments , such as for@@ m@@ er ch@@ an@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ or@@ s K@@ o@@ h@@ l and S@@ ch@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ t , t@@ en@@ d to be in favour of Turkey &apos;s European pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts when they are t@@ al@@ king as p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ ans but , when s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king at p@@ ri@@ va@@ te se@@ min@@ ar@@ s and con@@ f@@ er@@ ences , ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in that Turkey has no place in the European Union .
this conflict of words pa@@ in@@ ts us into a political cor@@ n@@ er .
perhaps , p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally , it h@@ el@@ p@@ s those who we say want an economic Europe ; however , it does not help the political Europe which interests the European Parliament .
so as long as certain parties be@@ have in a way which g@@ i@@ v@@ es the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion that the system which currently has the u@@ p@@ per hand in Turkey could take h@@ ol@@ d in Europe , then we are again pa@@ in@@ ted into a cor@@ n@@ er .
why ?
because every time we look for ar@@ gu@@ ments against Turkey &apos;s European pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts , we find them in Turkey &apos;s f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to ad@@ ap@@ t to European p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ es .
and the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ tion must be an ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te e@@ f@@ for@@ t as far as we are concerned .
ladies and gentlemen , we must be ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te and we must be f@@ a@@ i@@ r : ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with European c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a by Turkey , as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds its pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts , and f@@ a@@ i@@ r as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the way in which we control them .
this policy s@@ er@@ v@@ es us , it s@@ er@@ v@@ es Turkey and it s@@ er@@ v@@ es its people .
if , for any reason , we are not ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te on matters of respect for human rights , democracy , freedom and , at the same time , com@@ p@@ li@@ ance with international law , then we shall not be doing either ourselves or Turkey any f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
situation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a
Mr President , at the start of this part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion , the request from our group , the Union for a Europe of N@@ ations Group , for a debate on the situation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a was acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted .
the rec@@ e@@ p@@ tion acc@@ or@@ d@@ ed this request was just what one might ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y a w@@ a@@ ve of fin@@ e fe@@ el@@ in@@ g@@ s , fin@@ e but per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly gra@@ t@@ u@@ it@@ ous , on the part of the u@@ su@@ al r@@ an@@ ks of those for w@@ h@@ o@@ m the all @-@ pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e de@@ f@@ ence of human rights has become a s@@ or@@ t of k@@ n@@ e@@ e @-@ j@@ er@@ k re@@ action in the place of any real political an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es , as is the case for at least a few , with no result other than to h@@ i@@ d@@ e more ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ e in@@ t@@ en@@ tions .
so our own m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge is not com@@ pa@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ ate but political .
we , of course , wish to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our d@@ is@@ t@@ res@@ s at the he@@ in@@ ous v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence which b@@ r@@ u@@ is@@ es the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an n@@ ation a little more each day , but we are also aware that the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ ans have had more than enough com@@ pa@@ s@@ sion .
that , ladies and gentlemen , is the he@@ ar@@ t of the matter .
se@@ ver@@ al Member States are actually gu@@ il@@ ty of con@@ n@@ i@@ v@@ ing with the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res .
they ex@@ p@@ res@@ s re@@ g@@ re@@ t o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ally , w@@ h@@ il@@ st , be@@ h@@ in@@ d the sc@@ en@@ es , pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting , con@@ c@@ e@@ al@@ ing and w@@ el@@ com@@ ing .
s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es they even welcome in F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , in full k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al ac@@ ts com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in my own country .
we believe that any pro@@ per de@@ f@@ ence of human rights must be@@ g@@ in with the re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ement of the r@@ u@@ le of law in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a and must con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te towards en@@ sur@@ ing the a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity of a government and a p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent el@@ ec@@ ted in what we per@@ s@@ is@@ t in con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c el@@ ec@@ tions .
d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c human rights monitoring should not apply ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y to the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed governments .
I am th@@ in@@ king in particular of the other countries of North A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a , M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , T@@ un@@ is@@ i@@ a and L@@ i@@ b@@ y@@ a .
it must also help support them , in particular , a@@ si@@ de from all the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s which have been b@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ n up out of all pro@@ por@@ tion , when they come up against such an in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate k@@ il@@ ling f@@ r@@ en@@ z@@ y , which is all the more d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous because it is se@@ c@@ re@@ tly su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by external p@@ o@@ w@@ ers , p@@ o@@ w@@ ers which are not even European , if you get my d@@ ri@@ f@@ t , and which are taking ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of an un@@ st@@ able situation to pu@@ l@@ l st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ s be@@ h@@ in@@ d the sc@@ en@@ es , working through these f@@ an@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ s .
the ol@@ d g@@ a@@ m@@ es between em@@ p@@ i@@ res are at work , and the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m is not just the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an people , but A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a itself , and its ol@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t and ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly most f@@ a@@ i@@ th@@ ful f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds .
so , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t once and for all to get a clear gra@@ s@@ p of the state of a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
y@@ es , there are external for@@ c@@ es at work in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
Mr President , Commissioner , we must not l@@ o@@ s@@ e hope .
the h@@ op@@ es raised in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a and throughout the world by President B@@ ou@@ te@@ f@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ a &apos; s civil con@@ c@@ or@@ d initiative must not give way to the dis@@ en@@ ch@@ an@@ ted view that there is really nothing that can be done in this country to er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ate v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence and establish the r@@ u@@ le of law .
in the same way that we have made a commitment to su@@ p@@ por@@ ting those who , in the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e country , have re@@ b@@ el@@ l@@ ed against in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , it is our d@@ u@@ ty to do all we can to support those in favour of con@@ c@@ or@@ d and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
it is Europe &apos; s d@@ u@@ ty , and it is also in its interest .
it is in Europe &apos; s interest to ex@@ t@@ en@@ d the area of peace and st@@ ability which it has su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing within Europe to the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean , by con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
it is in Europe &apos; s interest to l@@ is@@ t@@ en to the ap@@ p@@ e@@ als it rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es from the whole of the con@@ t@@ in@@ ent of A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a to r@@ e @-@ establish for@@ m@@ s of cooperation which will e@@ a@@ si@@ ly t@@ u@@ r@@ n a pa@@ ge on the pa@@ in@@ ful h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y of dec@@ ol@@ on@@ is@@ ation .
we E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans must become aware that we have as much to g@@ a@@ in as to o@@ f@@ f@@ er in g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing this o@@ f@@ f the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
our own future will de@@ pen@@ d on the way we su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed in as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing the con@@ t@@ in@@ ent of A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a to em@@ er@@ ge from p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty and c@@ ha@@ o@@ s .
I am res@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to the te@@ m@@ p@@ ta@@ tion to se@@ al ourselves o@@ f@@ f in a F@@ or@@ t@@ res@@ s Europe which would be b@@ ou@@ n@@ d , one day , by its very nature , to find itself under si@@ e@@ ge .
that is why I shall support the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution which will be put to the vote in this House sh@@ or@@ tly .
on this o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion , I would ask our A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an par@@ t@@ n@@ ers to understand that we certainly do not want to look like we are s@@ er@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ing out of some s@@ or@@ t of fe@@ el@@ ing of su@@ per@@ i@@ or@@ ity , but as people of g@@ o@@ od@@ will , de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to as@@ s@@ is@@ t them , if they so wish , in pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing an end to their current tra@@ g@@ i@@ c p@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t and to r@@ e @-@ e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing with them , in future , the b@@ on@@ ds of f@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ sh@@ i@@ p which have l@@ in@@ k@@ ed us throughout h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a , the m@@ on@@ th of R@@ a@@ ma@@ d@@ an has been mar@@ k@@ ed by a new e@@ s@@ c@@ al@@ ation in the ter@@ ro@@ r : after all the d@@ re@@ ad@@ ful ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res which have taken place since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 , at the start of the civil war , not to m@@ en@@ tion the th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people tra@@ u@@ ma@@ t@@ ised or mis@@ sing , and the an@@ gu@@ ish and ter@@ ro@@ r of their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies .
despite the civil con@@ c@@ or@@ d law in@@ it@@ i@@ ated by p@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ent B@@ ou@@ te@@ f@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ a , there has been no h@@ al@@ t to the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an people still as@@ p@@ ir@@ e to peace and re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation , yet these ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to be ir@@ re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ able with lack of pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
as the international human rights organisations have s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n , the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ t ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m is being w@@ ag@@ ed il@@ le@@ g@@ ally .
it is c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al for the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an authorities to agree to bring all those responsible for all these c@@ r@@ im@@ es before the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
in this context , one question ar@@ is@@ es .
what is the m@@ e@@ an@@ ing of the ap@@ par@@ ent im@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ ence and pa@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ ity of the ar@@ m@@ ed for@@ c@@ es ?
in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a , no one can d@@ en@@ y the in@@ t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ g@@ ence of the s@@ en@@ i@@ or military h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y which has been in power for 3@@ 9 years , b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ king the political system and c@@ ul@@ ti@@ va@@ ting a lack of transparency .
for too long Europe has el@@ ec@@ ted not to in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ e in e@@ v@@ ents in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a , si@@ d@@ ing with the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion .
we need ur@@ g@@ ently to ad@@ just our si@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ is@@ ti@@ c M@@ an@@ ic@@ ha@@ e@@ an view which se@@ es I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ m as s@@ ol@@ el@@ y responsible for the current de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation .
A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an society is de@@ e@@ p@@ ly st@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ en by w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion and social and economic ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion .
Europe &apos; s f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to adopt a st@@ r@@ on@@ g position en@@ ta@@ il@@ s the r@@ is@@ k that the social for@@ c@@ es for change , which o@@ f@@ f@@ er hope for the future and which are at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to free themselves of the p@@ res@@ su@@ res re@@ la@@ ting to power , will be en@@ d@@ an@@ g@@ e@@ red and s@@ mo@@ th@@ e@@ red .
by re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing att@@ en@@ tive to the th@@ re@@ at@@ s a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting the people , and by making it possible to rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise a right of a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m , s@@ ol@@ i@@ d b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ g@@ es may be b@@ u@@ il@@ t between the two si@@ d@@ es of the Mediterranean .
in order to help A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a to g@@ a@@ in d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s , relations should c@@ e@@ a@@ se to be pu@@ re@@ ly a matter of state , but should be in the interests of the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es .
let us n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ get that any in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ em@@ ents of rights pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t the working c@@ la@@ s@@ ses and provide an i@@ d@@ e@@ al b@@ re@@ ed@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d for all s@@ or@@ ts of ex@@ t@@ re@@ mis@@ m .
Mr President , last T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t , 1@@ 1 people were m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ red at a f@@ al@@ se ro@@ ad@@ b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k in the A@@ in D@@ e@@ f@@ l@@ a pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce ; on S@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ day , 2@@ 4 December , a young c@@ ab@@ a@@ re@@ t s@@ in@@ g@@ er was m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ red in a dis@@ co@@ th@@ e@@ qu@@ e in the to@@ w@@ n of A@@ n@@ n@@ ab@@ a ; a w@@ e@@ e@@ k before that , 1@@ 6 high sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l st@@ u@@ d@@ ents were sa@@ va@@ g@@ el@@ y m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ red in@@ si@@ d@@ e their own bo@@ ar@@ ding sc@@ h@@ o@@ o@@ l .
A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a has just ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed its b@@ l@@ o@@ o@@ di@@ est R@@ a@@ ma@@ d@@ an for two years .
over two h@@ un@@ d@@ red people - men , women , children , the el@@ d@@ er@@ ly - have been m@@ u@@ r@@ de@@ red ; g@@ i@@ r@@ l@@ s have been ab@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted and ra@@ p@@ ed .
the h@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ d@@ ous , b@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ ous and in@@ human v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ ted by the I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ t gu@@ er@@ r@@ il@@ l@@ a groups ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to be on the increase , if indeed it ever actually c@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ d .
this information is ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed ma@@ in@@ ly from the n@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ pa@@ per@@ s .
indeed the re@@ la@@ tive o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al si@@ l@@ ence , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t perhaps in the case of f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers , can only be re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ted .
so I should like to pa@@ y t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an p@@ res@@ s , one of the most in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent in the A@@ ra@@ b world , which has pa@@ i@@ d such a high pr@@ ice at the h@@ an@@ ds of those who are im@@ pla@@ c@@ ab@@ ly op@@ p@@ o@@ sed to any form of freedom of ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion and who d@@ re@@ am of an u@@ n@@ e@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ated people subject to their d@@ i@@ k@@ ta@@ ts .
yet , in the last year , and more , th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s are su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to have sur@@ r@@ en@@ de@@ red their weapons in re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n for a to@@ ta@@ l a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y .
the el@@ ec@@ tion of President B@@ ou@@ te@@ f@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ a had given the people hope , but we are for@@ c@@ ed to ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that the p@@ at@@ h taken by the &apos; civil con@@ c@@ or@@ d law &apos; is a very long way from le@@ ad@@ ing to peace .
even though the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an people dis@@ pla@@ y@@ ed re@@ mar@@ k@@ a@@ ble res@@ is@@ t@@ ance in order to re@@ j@@ ec@@ t f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ m , the a@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y for such m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ers - d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed by some as c@@ r@@ im@@ es against h@@ u@@ man@@ ity - and the lack of pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ment en@@ for@@ c@@ ed upon the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of these c@@ r@@ im@@ es ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r to have ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated them to the point that they are con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing their m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ er@@ ous work .
su@@ re@@ ly attention should be pa@@ i@@ d in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d to the op@@ in@@ i@@ ons of the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations of the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , which are ou@@ tra@@ ged that they have received no form of com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion while &apos; pen@@ it@@ ent &apos; I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ t re@@ b@@ el@@ s are given financial support in order to be re@@ in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into society ?
su@@ re@@ ly the d@@ ou@@ b@@ ly c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ e@@ ous fi@@ g@@ h@@ t of A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an women should be rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised , since they are the main v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m yet , at the same time , still su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to a family c@@ od@@ e which f@@ l@@ ou@@ ts their most b@@ a@@ si@@ c rights ?
finally , the economic and social situation is also per@@ il@@ ous , when it already pro@@ v@@ ed a pro@@ p@@ it@@ i@@ ous b@@ re@@ ed@@ ing g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d for the r@@ ise of I@@ s@@ la@@ mis@@ m in the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
subject to in@@ t@@ en@@ se external p@@ res@@ su@@ res - I am th@@ in@@ king of de@@ b@@ t - A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a fin@@ ds itself in a crisis which has already led to an un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted r@@ ise in un@@ employment .
more than ever , s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts and with an A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a which is fi@@ g@@ h@@ ting against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and death and for a free future is ur@@ g@@ ently n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
Mr President , much has already been said by other Members .
this new ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y where even three @-@ year @-@ ol@@ d to@@ d@@ d@@ l@@ ers are k@@ il@@ led without h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ ation ta@@ k@@ es us back to a situation we h@@ op@@ ed was be@@ h@@ in@@ d us . while we all rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that , sa@@ d@@ ly , A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a will have to li@@ ve with ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m for some time to come , this u@@ p@@ sur@@ ge during R@@ a@@ ma@@ d@@ an is t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing the c@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k back .
we did hope President B@@ ou@@ te@@ f@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ a &apos; s initiative would have a positive effect , but the e@@ v@@ ents of the last few d@@ a@@ y@@ s give us cause for concern .
that is why , like other Members , I believe we must not h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ ate to con@@ d@@ em@@ n ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and o@@ f@@ f@@ er full cooperation to the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an government to de@@ fe@@ at it .
having said that , we must not let the ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ e the g@@ en@@ u@@ ine progress being made towards democracy and the r@@ u@@ le of law , and the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m cannot j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fy the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed d@@ om@@ in@@ ation of A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a by the op@@ a@@ qu@@ e , in@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ ta@@ ble power of the ar@@ my .
so , on his v@@ is@@ it , President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i was right to si@@ g@@ n an agreement and to give EUR 5 million to b@@ ol@@ st@@ er the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent p@@ res@@ s and establish a st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te for j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s .
I think that is ex@@ ac@@ tly what n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to be done , al@@ on@@ g with o@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m in our countries . unfortunately , that is not possible in some of them , while it has been possible , on the other hand , to provide h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al@@ ity for many ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s who have or@@ g@@ an@@ ised very d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks from there .
finally , I think we should consider s@@ en@@ ding a d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation to A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a .
it is a long time since Parliament v@@ is@@ ited that country and the first th@@ ing we need to do is find out ex@@ ac@@ tly what is going on .
Mr President , why is there a de@@ a@@ f@@ en@@ ing si@@ l@@ ence when it comes to Europe &apos; s res@@ p@@ on@@ se to the ma@@ s@@ s @-@ sc@@ al@@ e c@@ r@@ im@@ es in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a ?
this si@@ l@@ ence is in st@@ ar@@ k con@@ tra@@ st with our con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation of what el@@ se g@@ o@@ es w@@ r@@ on@@ g in the world .
the ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a have not c@@ e@@ a@@ se@@ d .
people continue to m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r .
t@@ or@@ ture is still the order of the day .
in the past year al@@ one , two to three h@@ un@@ d@@ red people were k@@ il@@ led each m@@ on@@ th in the most ap@@ p@@ al@@ l@@ ing way .
if we take st@@ o@@ c@@ k of t@@ en years of ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s are h@@ or@@ ri@@ f@@ ying . one h@@ un@@ d@@ red and fi@@ f@@ ty @-@ th@@ ou@@ s@@ and people k@@ il@@ led and another t@@ en th@@ ou@@ s@@ and people v@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
that is t@@ w@@ ice as many as under the P@@ in@@ o@@ ch@@ e@@ t re@@ g@@ im@@ e .
President B@@ u@@ te@@ f@@ l@@ i@@ k@@ a made fin@@ e pr@@ om@@ is@@ es to c@@ ur@@ b v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , en@@ ter into dialogue and look into dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ an@@ c@@ es .
but little of these pr@@ om@@ is@@ es has been trans@@ la@@ ted into action .
people still go un@@ pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
B@@ ar@@ b@@ ar@@ i@@ ans who in the de@@ a@@ d of n@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out m@@ on@@ st@@ r@@ ous s@@ la@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ter@@ in@@ g@@ s , continue to get o@@ f@@ f s@@ co@@ t @-@ free .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , security t@@ ro@@ op@@ s who are gu@@ il@@ ty of w@@ r@@ on@@ g @-@ d@@ o@@ in@@ g@@ s are not being b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to j@@ u@@ st@@ ice .
pl@@ ent@@ y of reason , therefore , to take the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an authorities to ta@@ s@@ k about this .
but why , in fact , is this not being done ?
is it because of the French b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s interests in the for@@ m@@ er c@@ ol@@ on@@ y ?
are the Member States k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing qu@@ i@@ e@@ t because they are h@@ op@@ ing to se@@ c@@ ur@@ e some l@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ tive b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s de@@ als themselves ?
are we fe@@ ar@@ ful about A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m in our own countries ?
or is it ma@@ in@@ ly the fe@@ a@@ r of further f@@ an@@ n@@ ing the f@@ la@@ m@@ es of M@@ u@@ s@@ li@@ m f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ m ?
the most f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l ta@@ s@@ k of the state is to pro@@ te@@ c@@ t its people .
it is s@@ ha@@ m@@ e@@ ful how the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an authorities do not come up to the mar@@ k in this respect .
it is high time that the European Union to@@ o@@ k a st@@ and for the sa@@ k@@ e of the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an population and put its own interests second .
the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence has g@@ o@@ t to st@@ o@@ p .
an as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation agreement must be st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k at the e@@ ar@@ li@@ est opportunity , th@@ us al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing us to in@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ fy the political dialogue .
my question to the Commissioner is the following : what is the la@@ te@@ st ?
for we cannot k@@ e@@ e@@ p qu@@ i@@ e@@ t any longer .
the Commission s@@ ha@@ res Parliament &apos;s concern about the situation of the Turkish pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers who are still on h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e .
the health of certain of these pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers is a matter of serious concern .
it c@@ al@@ l@@ s upon the Turkish authorities to se@@ e@@ k a p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
in any e@@ v@@ ent , the Turkish security for@@ c@@ es should ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise re@@ st@@ ra@@ in@@ t .
concerning the op@@ er@@ ations con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ted by p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e and ar@@ my in 20 pr@@ is@@ ons in December last year , the Commission ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ts that in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ations will be carried out into the c@@ a@@ u@@ ses of the de@@ a@@ th@@ s and the c@@ a@@ su@@ al@@ ti@@ es which o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red during these op@@ er@@ ations and that those responsible will be i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied .
al@@ le@@ g@@ ations of t@@ or@@ ture and il@@ l t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers during their trans@@ f@@ er after the op@@ er@@ ations should also be in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ g@@ ated .
the Commission rec@@ al@@ l@@ s that the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of d@@ et@@ en@@ tion conditions in Turkish pr@@ is@@ ons is ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed in the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p for Turkey which received political ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l by the Council on 4 December 2000 .
in the acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p , the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of the d@@ et@@ en@@ tion conditions to bring them into line with the UN st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d min@@ im@@ u@@ m rules for the t@@ re@@ at@@ ment of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers and other international n@@ or@@ m@@ s is con@@ si@@ de@@ red as a priority .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing now to A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a , I can say the following : the Commission b@@ ac@@ ks the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an authorities &apos; efforts to bring about national re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ation and end the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
democracy , the r@@ u@@ le of law , human rights and f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s are key pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es that the European Union ap@@ p@@ li@@ es even @-@ h@@ an@@ d@@ ed@@ ly to all its par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
we ap@@ pla@@ u@@ d A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a &apos;s acc@@ e@@ p@@ t@@ an@@ ce of the re@@ le@@ v@@ ant c@@ la@@ use in the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations for an as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation agreement .
the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence , however , pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ es new v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s every m@@ on@@ th .
we are particularly concerned by the u@@ p@@ sur@@ ge of v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence during R@@ a@@ ma@@ d@@ an which c@@ la@@ im@@ ed many li@@ v@@ es ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the country .
A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a must also find a way of ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing the past c@@ r@@ im@@ es of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t@@ s who have r@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
though under@@ st@@ an@@ ding the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty of ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a , the Commission n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s re@@ ma@@ in@@ s concerned at the human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations and , in particular , the dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ an@@ c@@ es .
it is v@@ it@@ al that res@@ ol@@ u@@ te action be taken against re@@ t@@ ro@@ gra@@ de mo@@ v@@ es and v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations in the matter of human rights .
we continue to ra@@ ise these issues at every level of the political dialogue with the A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an authorities .
Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , for example , st@@ res@@ sed the need to re@@ st@@ or@@ e peace throughout the country during his v@@ is@@ it to A@@ l@@ g@@ i@@ ers on 1@@ 2 and 1@@ 3 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary .
as part of this approach and in order to provide ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al support for A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a &apos;s efforts , the Commission , re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , has si@@ g@@ n@@ ed fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents g@@ r@@ an@@ ting EUR 1@@ 3 million for two human rights projects .
one con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s of support for the country &apos;s m@@ ed@@ i@@ a and j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s and the other one re@@ la@@ tes to m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ is@@ ation and ed@@ u@@ c@@ ating the p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force , making it able to work as a p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e force should in a democracy .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
de@@ pen@@ ding on when the debate en@@ ds , the vote will take place at ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
as you know , after the to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent debate , we will have a sh@@ or@@ t b@@ re@@ a@@ k until 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and then the decision will be taken as to whether or not to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one the debate on the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report .

B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 7@@ 8 / 2001 by Mr S@@ a@@ k@@ el@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ o@@ u and others , on behalf of the P@@ S@@ E Group , on the ra@@ ti@@ fication of the Treaty of R@@ om@@ e to establish the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court .
B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 8@@ 5 / 2001 by Mr d@@ i L@@ el@@ l@@ o F@@ in@@ u@@ ol@@ i and others , on behalf of the G@@ U@@ E / N@@ G@@ L Group , on the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that this matter fe@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ res on the agenda here today , for the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court is doing well .
the de@@ ad@@ line for the st@@ a@@ tes to si@@ g@@ n this Treaty of R@@ om@@ e was 3@@ 1 December .
we all know how difficult is was to bring it about .
despite this , we sa@@ w how in the very last d@@ a@@ y@@ s of 2000 , all of a su@@ d@@ d@@ en a h@@ u@@ ge number of countries si@@ g@@ n@@ ed the Treaty .
at the time , 1@@ 20 countries voted in favour and 7 against .
at present , more than 1@@ 3@@ 0 countries have si@@ g@@ n@@ ed it , including the United States which or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ally voted against it , but also I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l , I@@ r@@ an and Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a si@@ g@@ n@@ ed it at the last moment .
at any ra@@ te , this w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d support for the Treaty d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes that the Treaty cannot be con@@ si@@ de@@ red a n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n @-@ h@@ em@@ is@@ p@@ here t@@ re@@ at@@ y or one of de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries .
the support for it is far too w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d for that .
we now need to ra@@ ti@@ fy the Treaty , and that is what the resolution is about .
it is a j@@ o@@ y to see that 2@@ 7 countries have already ra@@ ti@@ fied it , e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of which are in the European Union , but Sweden , the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m , P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al , the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds , I@@ re@@ land , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and D@@ en@@ mar@@ k have not yet si@@ g@@ n@@ ed it .
they are th@@ in@@ king about it , but it has not yet ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed .
of all the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ant countries , not one s@@ in@@ g@@ le country has ra@@ ti@@ fied it , and Turkey did not even si@@ g@@ n it .
we therefore need to r@@ ol@@ l up our s@@ le@@ e@@ v@@ es , and we call on the Council to ad@@ d this matter to the agenda .
it is important for Europe to take the le@@ a@@ d .
that is something we can do ourselves , and we should not just la@@ y the b@@ la@@ me on others in the process .
we can take action , and it is important that we do so without further d@@ el@@ a@@ y .
Mr President , I will be b@@ ri@@ e@@ f . the next s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er but one on the l@@ is@@ t is down as Mr F@@ r@@ an@@ z X@@ a@@ v@@ er M@@ a@@ y@@ er .
but it is Mr H@@ ans @-@ P@@ e@@ ter M@@ a@@ y@@ er who will be s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king for our group .
one is a first @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an on agricultural matters ; the other is a first @-@ c@@ la@@ s@@ s j@@ ur@@ is@@ t .
I simply w@@ an@@ ted to c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fy that for you to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d there being any con@@ f@@ u@@ sion about who will speak .
thank you , Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t .
you are as it were our re@@ si@@ d@@ ent l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ out .
nothing e@@ s@@ c@@ ap@@ es you !
thank you for p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing that out .
I am sure that I would have no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed la@@ ter on , because the right Mr M@@ a@@ y@@ er is also in the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er .
( V@@ er@@ ts / A@@ L@@ E ) . ( it ) Mr President , I must say I do en@@ v@@ y Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t his p@@ o@@ w@@ ers as a t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ e , which not all of us in this House p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ s .
however , the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ se@@ v@@ en countries which have ra@@ ti@@ fied the Treaty of R@@ om@@ e in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t Member States of the European Union , while the other se@@ v@@ en have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to the call .
that is one of the par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ es of the European Union and it is also a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of the lack of a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine common f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy .
indeed , what other mo@@ tive can there be for the Member States of the Union which have not yet ra@@ ti@@ fied the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te , a@@ part from h@@ e@@ s@@ it@@ ation about a real , si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant further trans@@ f@@ er of s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty and a certain lack of con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in themselves , perhaps still fe@@ ar@@ ing that one day they may s@@ om@@ e@@ how find themselves in the un@@ com@@ for@@ ta@@ ble position of the acc@@ used ?
that ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ap@@ p@@ li@@ es even more to the other major pla@@ y@@ ers on the international sc@@ en@@ e .
it was right to no@@ te , as we did in our resolution , that President C@@ l@@ in@@ t@@ on si@@ g@@ n@@ ed the Treaty of R@@ om@@ e at the end of last year , but it is le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te to w@@ on@@ d@@ er if he would have done so had the F@@ l@@ or@@ i@@ d@@ a vote ch@@ an@@ c@@ ed to give the v@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ y to A@@ l G@@ or@@ e .
there is still a long road , f@@ ra@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t with ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es , to be co@@ v@@ e@@ red before the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t can actually start work . as the resolution su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ s , it is v@@ it@@ al to pre@@ v@@ ent ch@@ an@@ g@@ es to the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te and there needs to be action to bring the im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing regulation ra@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ ly into force or , at least , fin@@ al@@ ise it .
we hope the European Union will make this one of its f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy priorities since we are all in agreement , in th@@ e@@ or@@ y , and we also hope Parliament can continue to pla@@ y an in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ en@@ ti@@ al role to make the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t a re@@ al@@ ity , pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the issue of the c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al c@@ ou@@ r@@ t on the agenda for every meeting of the m@@ i@@ x@@ ed d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations , and su@@ p@@ por@@ ting and ad@@ op@@ ting res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions like the one we will be v@@ o@@ ting on sh@@ or@@ tly .
I therefore re@@ g@@ re@@ t the fact that the j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution does not p@@ ic@@ k up the issue of the m@@ i@@ x@@ ed d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations , but I fully en@@ d@@ or@@ se the proposal and hope we will be able to adopt it .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in a few min@@ u@@ tes Parliament will be ad@@ op@@ ting a resolution on the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court for the e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ th time in f@@ our years . this is e@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence of Parliament &apos; s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation and res@@ ol@@ ve in following , st@@ e@@ p by st@@ e@@ p , the s@@ l@@ o@@ w development of an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly necessary international j@@ u@@ st@@ ice - as d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted by the cases of M@@ il@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ i@@ c , M@@ la@@ di@@ c , P@@ in@@ o@@ ch@@ e@@ t and so many others .
they are now be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to l@@ o@@ s@@ e the im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity which has so far en@@ su@@ red that so many as@@ sa@@ s@@ s@@ in@@ s and c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als have been able to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y on in their p@@ o@@ st@@ s un@@ dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ed , and even take re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment with full h@@ on@@ ou@@ r@@ s . it also d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes how com@@ m@@ it@@ ted Parliament is to that development , p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing the way for the European Union in many cases .
I re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er the e@@ ar@@ ly res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions , when we called l@@ ou@@ d@@ ly for a European Union with 1@@ 5 Member States un@@ ited and res@@ ol@@ u@@ te in this fi@@ g@@ h@@ t , de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the essential pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t : the in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence of the pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ to@@ r , the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t &apos; s a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y in t@@ r@@ ying c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als , the defin@@ ition of the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t &apos; s man@@ d@@ ate and so on .
those objectives have been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed .
Mrs F@@ ra@@ s@@ s@@ on@@ i has ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly st@@ res@@ sed the importance of con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing those objectives and de@@ f@@ en@@ ding the con@@ t@@ ent of the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te from those who si@@ g@@ n up to it - such as C@@ l@@ in@@ t@@ on , for in@@ st@@ ance , or others - to continue to b@@ el@@ on@@ g to the Court A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly of Member P@@ ar@@ ti@@ es , but actually in order to in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations n@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , even se@@ e@@ king ex@@ em@@ p@@ tion for A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an s@@ ol@@ di@@ ers .
ex@@ em@@ p@@ tion is not what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed ; what is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed is to achieve the si@@ x@@ ti@@ et@@ h ra@@ ti@@ fication as s@@ o@@ on as possible . that is the real te@@ st for the fi@@ f@@ te@@ en .
I hope the issue will be on the agenda in our relations with third countries , and I hope the se@@ v@@ en countries of the Union which have not yet ra@@ ti@@ fied the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te will do so this year .
Mr President , it does indeed cause some con@@ f@@ u@@ sion when two people have the same sur@@ n@@ a@@ me and not even the par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y st@@ a@@ f@@ f are able to d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ gu@@ ish between them .
our p@@ o@@ s@@ t also g@@ et@@ s m@@ i@@ x@@ ed up s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es for the same reason .
following the h@@ or@@ ri@@ fi@@ c e@@ v@@ ents of the S@@ ec@@ on@@ d W@@ or@@ l@@ d W@@ a@@ r , the United N@@ ations re@@ f@@ l@@ o@@ ated the idea of se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up an international c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al c@@ ou@@ r@@ t .
further im@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ s was given to this initiative by the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations of international law in Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and the ma@@ s@@ sa@@ c@@ res in R@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ a .
some people are as@@ king where the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court will have j@@ ur@@ is@@ d@@ ic@@ tion com@@ pa@@ red with the c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts which already ex@@ is@@ t .
the E@@ C@@ J in L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g rules on the ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ ation and in@@ ter@@ pre@@ ta@@ tion of the t@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es of the European Union .
the In@@ ter@@ national Court of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice in T@@ he H@@ ag@@ u@@ e rules on international dis@@ pu@@ tes .
the In@@ ter@@ national Court of Human Rights in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g pa@@ s@@ ses j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ement on v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations by States of rights ar@@ is@@ ing from the Human Rights C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court is being set up for the f@@ our particularly serious c@@ r@@ im@@ es of g@@ en@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e , c@@ r@@ im@@ es against h@@ u@@ man@@ ity , war c@@ r@@ im@@ es and c@@ r@@ im@@ es of ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion .
until now the United N@@ ations has a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ised special c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts , for example the a@@ d h@@ o@@ c c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ als for the c@@ r@@ im@@ es com@@ m@@ it@@ ted in Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a and R@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ a .
in the future , the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court will s@@ en@@ d out a clear si@@ g@@ n@@ al that per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of any of these c@@ r@@ im@@ es will be pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ ted and pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
war c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ als will no longer be able to h@@ i@@ d@@ e be@@ h@@ in@@ d the b@@ or@@ d@@ ers of s@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ty .
the new Court is an important ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ement for the international com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity which will allow it to c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e l@@ o@@ op@@ h@@ ol@@ es in c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ tion .
I should therefore like to call on all of the Member States to ra@@ ti@@ fy the S@@ ta@@ t@@ u@@ te s@@ o@@ on , and I would re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d ad@@ op@@ tion of the resolution .
Mr President , this j@@ o@@ in@@ t motion for a resolution on the ra@@ ti@@ fication of the R@@ om@@ e Treaty to establish the per@@ man@@ ent In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court comes at an op@@ por@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e moment .
only y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day in this House we de@@ b@@ ated our priorities for the United N@@ ations Human Rights Commission in G@@ en@@ e@@ v@@ a .
the Swedish pr@@ im@@ e min@@ is@@ ter once again re@@ it@@ er@@ ated the importance of human rights during the Swedish Presidency .
the discussion this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on is yet another v@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ d re@@ min@@ d@@ er of in@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ic@@ es ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the world .
therefore it must follow , and I hope the House will agree , that if we are serious about the human rights of men , women and children , then we must have a per@@ man@@ ent In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court to pro@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ te those who c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out or com@@ mis@@ sion c@@ r@@ im@@ es against h@@ u@@ man@@ ity .
we need a c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al c@@ ou@@ r@@ t with international j@@ ur@@ is@@ d@@ ic@@ tion , which can in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ently j@@ u@@ d@@ ge those acc@@ used of such at@@ ro@@ c@@ ities .
only with com@@ p@@ le@@ te de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to implement the R@@ om@@ e Treaty will we be able to end the im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity of the per@@ p@@ et@@ ra@@ t@@ or@@ s of these c@@ r@@ im@@ es and con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the de@@ ter@@ r@@ ence and pre@@ v@@ en@@ tion of such c@@ r@@ im@@ es in the future .
as we have he@@ ar@@ d , 1@@ 3@@ 9 governments have si@@ g@@ n@@ ed the R@@ om@@ e Treaty yet sa@@ d@@ ly only 2@@ 7 have ra@@ ti@@ fied it .
si@@ x@@ ty such ra@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ations are n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed for the Treaty to en@@ ter into force and for the Court to be set up .
therefore I believe it is im@@ per@@ a@@ ti@@ ve that the Member States set an example .
already I@@ t@@ al@@ y , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce , B@@ el@@ g@@ i@@ u@@ m , L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , S@@ pa@@ in , G@@ er@@ many , A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a and F@@ in@@ land have no@@ ta@@ b@@ ly and h@@ on@@ ou@@ ra@@ b@@ ly ra@@ ti@@ fied the Treaty .
it is now time for the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing Member States of the Union to follow su@@ it .
c@@ y@@ n@@ ic@@ is@@ m is an e@@ as@@ y op@@ tion and I will not in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge in it .
I believe we should welcome the si@@ g@@ n@@ ing of the Treaty on 3@@ 1 December by the United States of A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a and we should also welcome the Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation si@@ g@@ n@@ ing the Treaty on 1@@ 9 December 2000 .
we must now call upon those par@@ li@@ a@@ ments to ra@@ ti@@ fy the Treaty .
n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , at the same time we must ur@@ ge all st@@ a@@ tes to continue to support the work of the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ als for R@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ a and for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a .
h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y te@@ ac@@ h@@ es us that we must n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ get .
therefore , look back ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the last m@@ il@@ l@@ en@@ n@@ i@@ u@@ m .
look now ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the world as it is and re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that the pr@@ ice of freedom is e@@ ter@@ n@@ al v@@ i@@ g@@ il@@ ance .
future g@@ en@@ er@@ ations will n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ give us if we t@@ u@@ r@@ n our min@@ ds a@@ way from those who have su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red such ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying at@@ ro@@ c@@ ities and who continue to su@@ f@@ f@@ er as I speak .
words are not enough .
the time for action is now .
si@@ g@@ n the R@@ om@@ e Treaty on the I@@ C@@ C and th@@ e@@ re@@ by si@@ g@@ n@@ al our commitment and our ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge to the re@@ st of the world .
as c@@ o @-@ a@@ u@@ th@@ or I ur@@ ge the House and the Council to support this motion .
Mr President , if we look at the l@@ is@@ t of EU Member States which have already ra@@ ti@@ fied the Treaty , we see that fi@@ ve of the si@@ x f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ er Members have already com@@ p@@ le@@ ted ra@@ ti@@ fication .
only the N@@ e@@ th@@ er@@ l@@ an@@ ds has not , although it c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ed ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ ally h@@ ar@@ d for this Court and also for its he@@ ad@@ qu@@ ar@@ ters .
we therefore w@@ on@@ d@@ er what li@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d this .
of the re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing n@@ ine Member States of the European Union , there are only three which have already ra@@ ti@@ fied it , including much m@@ al@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ed A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a .
I should also like to call on the other States of the European Union to in@@ it@@ i@@ ate the ra@@ ti@@ fication process as s@@ o@@ on as possible .
we need this C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court so that international c@@ r@@ im@@ es against h@@ u@@ man@@ ity - which , as you know , have unfortunately not d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ed but t@@ en@@ ded to increase in number - can finally be re@@ f@@ er@@ red to a si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant , objective and wor@@ l@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ d@@ e b@@ od@@ y .
e@@ ar@@ li@@ er we s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e about C@@ a@@ m@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
we are de@@ b@@ ating the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a .
the special t@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ als which are set up there are certainly j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
but we must be aware that they are being de@@ f@@ a@@ m@@ ed by some n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t for@@ c@@ es in these countries who say that they are v@@ ic@@ t@@ or@@ s &apos; c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
to pre@@ v@@ ent this from con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en , it is t@@ re@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ou@@ s@@ ly important for there s@@ o@@ on to be one uni@@ fied c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al c@@ ou@@ r@@ t throughout the world so that we no longer need to op@@ er@@ ate through special c@@ ou@@ r@@ ts .
the C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al T@@ ri@@ b@@ un@@ al for the for@@ m@@ er Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v@@ i@@ a in T@@ he H@@ ag@@ u@@ e is very com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ able .
it needs our support .
but you will have seen that two d@@ a@@ y@@ s ago President K@@ o@@ st@@ un@@ ic@@ a , who only rec@@ ently was making s@@ ol@@ em@@ n s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es in Parliament , re@@ f@@ u@@ sed to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve J@@ u@@ st@@ ice D@@ e@@ l P@@ on@@ te because she was al@@ le@@ g@@ ed@@ ly not of e@@ qu@@ al r@@ an@@ k in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the rules of pro@@ to@@ co@@ l .
this is s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ ous .
it s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s how important it is not only to en@@ sh@@ r@@ ine legal st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds in international law throughout the world , di@@ rec@@ ted against ex@@ pu@@ l@@ sion , ma@@ s@@ s m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ er and ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion , but also to provide the cor@@ res@@ p@@ on@@ ding in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments with which to en@@ force them .
this is first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most this C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court .
we have wor@@ k@@ ed h@@ ar@@ d for it and it is high time that it be able to take up its d@@ u@@ ti@@ es .
even though the se@@ t@@ t@@ ing @-@ up of the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court does not come within its re@@ m@@ it , the Commission h@@ op@@ es that the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red number of 6@@ 0 ra@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ations will s@@ o@@ on be re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed so that the Court can become op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al .
as of 3@@ 1 December , the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te was si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by 1@@ 3@@ 9 countries and ra@@ ti@@ fied by 2@@ 7 .
the Commission no@@ tes , with sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion , that the United States si@@ g@@ n@@ ed the R@@ om@@ e S@@ ta@@ t@@ u@@ te on 3@@ 1 December and the Y@@ u@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v F@@ ed@@ er@@ ation e@@ ar@@ li@@ er on 1@@ 9 December .
in its relations with third countries the Commission will make every e@@ f@@ for@@ t to rec@@ all the n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ity to si@@ g@@ n and ra@@ ti@@ fy the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ te as s@@ w@@ i@@ f@@ tly as possible .
in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , the Commission will continue to provide g@@ r@@ an@@ ts to initiatives in support of the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court .
so far , ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 4@@ .@@ 8 million of g@@ r@@ an@@ ts have been pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed to support the ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities of N@@ G@@ O@@ s or institutions working on information c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s concerning the In@@ ter@@ national C@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ al Court .
the Commission will provide further support for these ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities this year .
we want to promote this and use our cooperation with N@@ G@@ O@@ s to k@@ e@@ e@@ p up the m@@ om@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ m to make this Court a re@@ al@@ ity .
thank you , Commissioner .

B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 7@@ 9 / 2001 by Mr S@@ e@@ g@@ ur@@ o and others , on behalf of the P@@ S@@ E Group , on the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or ;
B@@ 5 @-@ 0@@ 0@@ 7@@ 9 / 2001 by Mr W@@ ur@@ t@@ z , on behalf of the G@@ U@@ E / N@@ G@@ L Group , on the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
Mr President , dis@@ a@@ st@@ er has st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k once again in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , two years after M@@ it@@ ch , the ter@@ ri@@ ble h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e effects are still being f@@ el@@ t to this day and for which , I might ad@@ d , it would se@@ e@@ m the European Union still has not come up with the money it had pr@@ om@@ ised .
I welcome the resolution which we were able to d@@ ra@@ f@@ t together , but I do consider it to be the b@@ are min@@ im@@ u@@ m after all the dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers which E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or has ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed , and now after this last e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e dis@@ a@@ st@@ er .
if t@@ r@@ u@@ th be t@@ ol@@ d , I find it a b@@ it of a f@@ l@@ im@@ s@@ y resolution , for although the fe@@ el@@ ing of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity which we all share and which g@@ a@@ ve r@@ ise to this resolution may be ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed well , we need to trans@@ late our s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity into action , and that is why , on behalf of our group , we have tabled a few more amendments in order to bring this idea more into f@@ o@@ c@@ us and to re@@ in@@ for@@ ce it .
a@@ m@@ on@@ g other things , this is to en@@ able the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing pl@@ ans for im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the situation to be put into practice , especially the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programmes , but we should also d@@ el@@ i@@ v@@ er the money that Europe had set a@@ si@@ de for this .
despite this , we believe that the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e world , and we , al@@ on@@ g with the world , must ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our dis@@ may and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity , now that th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people have f@@ al@@ l@@ en v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m to this e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e .
an e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in a p@@ o@@ or country is , of course , all the more serious the less res@@ is@@ t@@ ance and less re@@ si@@ li@@ ence the country has .
E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or has sur@@ v@@ i@@ v@@ ed a war and natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers , and now there is this on to@@ p of e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se .
in order to work ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally in en@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ ally responsible c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , the government too should set its political pre@@ f@@ er@@ ences for certain for@@ m@@ s of p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ ation of aid to one si@@ d@@ e , and we , on the other hand , must m@@ e@@ e@@ t our ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations .
Mr President , with regard to this resolution , which has received the con@@ s@@ en@@ su@@ s of all the groups , I would like to m@@ en@@ tion the last se@@ c@@ tion , which re@@ f@@ ers to the need for e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s of the economic aid which , on this o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion , we are going to s@@ en@@ d to E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , that very n@@ e@@ ed@@ y country .
I have just s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en to the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e responsible for h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid in N@@ ic@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ a and I would like to com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ate to this House , and to the Commissioner , the great concern of all those s@@ el@@ f @-@ sa@@ c@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ ing people who , today , are working on em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid , and who , t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , will be involved in cooperation work , and the concern of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish and international m@@ ed@@ i@@ a about the fact that we have yet to s@@ en@@ d the pr@@ om@@ ised economic aid following h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch , when we are now f@@ ac@@ ing the next tra@@ g@@ i@@ c e@@ v@@ ent .
Members of the Commission , let us see if , this time , we can make it on time .
I am sa@@ ying this not only as a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the D@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation for R@@ el@@ ations with the C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ ri@@ es of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a and M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o , but also as co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ating s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ m@@ an of the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party and European D@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ts in the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l .
to s@@ pen@@ d so late is to th@@ ro@@ w money a@@ way .
money must be s@@ p@@ ent on time and the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als - not only those in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , but also those in B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s - will have to as@@ su@@ me their res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
Mr K@@ in@@ no@@ c@@ k &apos; s reform must s@@ er@@ ve some pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e .
let us see whether or not , this time , the aid to al@@ le@@ v@@ i@@ ate the consequences of the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e ar@@ ri@@ ve before another tra@@ g@@ i@@ c e@@ v@@ ent st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ es this s@@ is@@ ter country .
to be effective , aid must ar@@ ri@@ ve at the right time .
o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , there will be so many people working with no com@@ pen@@ sa@@ tion in those countries , so many people w@@ a@@ it@@ ing , so many ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive costs , and for what ?
if we cannot do it any other way , let us s@@ en@@ d aid by means of the Member States .
we already give money to the UN - to the U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R - we are the main con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s , and they only f@@ ly the United N@@ ations f@@ la@@ g .
so , although it does not look good , let us do it by means of S@@ pa@@ in or A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ a , or under two f@@ la@@ g@@ s , but the em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid , and especially the cooperation aid , must ar@@ ri@@ ve .
let us not make f@@ o@@ ol@@ s of ourselves again .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the fi@@ gu@@ res and i@@ ma@@ g@@ es com@@ ing out of E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or are ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ying , with the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of de@@ a@@ d , the th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of w@@ ou@@ n@@ ded , the h@@ un@@ d@@ re@@ ds of people who have dis@@ ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ re@@ d and the ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 2@@ 6@@ ,@@ 000 who have l@@ o@@ s@@ t their h@@ om@@ es .
there are con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ al a@@ f@@ ter@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ c@@ ks in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or and even in N@@ ic@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ a .
this situation o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ r@@ ing in C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a is nothing new .
as Mrs M@@ a@@ es and Mr P@@ om@@ é@@ z R@@ u@@ i@@ z p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out , H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch , in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 , also had tra@@ g@@ i@@ c consequences in both human and ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al terms in that part of the world .
C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a is one of the world &apos; s p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st regions .
ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 4@@ 0 % of the population li@@ ve b@@ el@@ o@@ w the p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty line and Europe therefore has a particular responsibility to the region not only because it is a region that has ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed much serious conflict and where there is still t@@ en@@ sion , particularly over b@@ or@@ d@@ ers , but also because we need to as@@ s@@ is@@ t their rec@@ o@@ very for the sa@@ k@@ e of democracy .
I am ha@@ p@@ p@@ y to say that all bo@@ di@@ es there are d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c@@ ally el@@ ec@@ ted , but very un@@ d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ha@@ b@@ its still re@@ main in these C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an countries .
a@@ part from this , they have a very large f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n de@@ b@@ t and only two countries are involved in the initiative that has been la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed .
therefore , the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion we rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve from the pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al authorities in C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an countries - and on T@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ day we had the opportunity to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve the President of H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s - is of a people that is su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing and that , just when it se@@ es a little li@@ g@@ h@@ t at the end of the t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ l and st@@ ar@@ ts to p@@ ic@@ k itself up in order to con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t its problems and its h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y , is st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k by tra@@ g@@ i@@ c s@@ it@@ u@@ ations c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by these natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers .
Europe ac@@ ted pr@@ om@@ p@@ tly in s@@ en@@ ding em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid , both in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 and this time .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the problem re@@ qu@@ i@@ res - as my two f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Members have already st@@ a@@ ted more than a@@ de@@ qu@@ a@@ te@@ ly - more st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l aid .
it is v@@ it@@ al that the Commission im@@ pl@@ em@@ ents its re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme for C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a .
what we are pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing , Commissioner N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on , is that there should be a ra@@ p@@ i@@ d re@@ defin@@ ition of this programme , with greater resources , both human and financial , to achieve the objective of as@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ing E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or as well .
on 2@@ 6 M@@ ar@@ ch of this year , another meeting will be held between the S@@ an J@@ o@@ s@@ é Group and the European Union in G@@ u@@ a@@ te@@ m@@ al@@ a .
a positive way to con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de this meeting with the S@@ an J@@ o@@ s@@ é Group would be to pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed to implement the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme for C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a with the new procedure for h@@ el@@ p@@ ing the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
Mr President , my group , the C@@ on@@ f@@ ed@@ er@@ al Group of the European United L@@ e@@ f@@ t / N@@ or@@ di@@ c G@@ re@@ en L@@ e@@ f@@ t , would like to ad@@ d its v@@ o@@ ice to the ex@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ons of s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y for the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of the recent e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e , and for the people of E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , following this la@@ te@@ st tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y .
in fact , I had the h@@ on@@ our and gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying responsibility of p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing a report to this House , on behalf of the Committee on E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al Affairs , on aid for the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a following H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch , which was adopted un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly .
the t@@ r@@ u@@ th is that I feel f@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ ted that our h@@ op@@ es and efforts have not been ac@@ com@@ p@@ an@@ i@@ ed by e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme .
on that o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion , I p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out that , when the h@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k , the Commission ac@@ ted qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly in terms of in@@ it@@ i@@ al aid .
this has been the case this time as well , but we must continue to provide this aid . we must be more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
the sc@@ al@@ e of the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e was con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able .
this region was be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing to rec@@ over and it is going to be essential that we make an im@@ m@@ en@@ se e@@ f@@ for@@ t to achieve levels of economic , social and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c security .
the European Union has to do some very h@@ ar@@ d work in this area and , a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the problems to be f@@ ac@@ ed , there is one I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t : the f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ul@@ ent di@@ ver@@ si@@ ons of the aid s@@ ent .
the European Union - and the Commission in particular - must pre@@ v@@ ent this from ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ing , by gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing that as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations , N@@ G@@ O@@ s and local authorities ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in the u@@ ti@@ l@@ is@@ ation of the aid , for the sa@@ k@@ e of the e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and j@@ u@@ st@@ ice of the efforts made by the European Union .
Mr President , the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group is s@@ ha@@ k@@ en and f@@ il@@ l@@ ed with con@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ ation at the n@@ e@@ ws of the se@@ ver@@ e e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
we ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our de@@ e@@ p s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with the many who di@@ ed or were in@@ j@@ u@@ red and the many who have l@@ o@@ s@@ t their family and their p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
the P@@ P@@ E @-@ D@@ E Group su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the motion for a resolution tabled by se@@ ver@@ al groups in the European Parliament .
it is good to know that the Community has res@@ p@@ on@@ ded to this natural c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he so pr@@ om@@ p@@ tly by dis@@ p@@ at@@ ch@@ ing ex@@ per@@ ts and money .
this is a con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ing example of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity .
this is a su@@ it@@ able o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion for me to ad@@ d that , as a positive m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the g@@ en@@ er@@ ation of 6@@ 8 , when I was a res@@ er@@ ve o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ er in the G@@ er@@ m@@ an ar@@ my in the se@@ v@@ en@@ ti@@ es , I did not th@@ ro@@ w st@@ on@@ es as other young men did , but se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ed with my own h@@ an@@ ds for the de@@ a@@ d and in@@ j@@ u@@ red in an area of I@@ t@@ al@@ y which had su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red an e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e . on that o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ sion we were able to res@@ c@@ u@@ e very many people who had been b@@ u@@ ri@@ ed al@@ i@@ ve .
this is a great j@@ o@@ y .
I can still see the d@@ re@@ ad@@ ful i@@ ma@@ g@@ es from the se@@ v@@ en@@ ti@@ es of the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in I@@ t@@ al@@ y , and I can understand the s@@ en@@ se of d@@ is@@ t@@ res@@ s pre@@ va@@ il@@ ing in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
it is excellent that Europe has s@@ ent help so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
it is to be h@@ op@@ ed that the aid will not come too late and that it will en@@ ter E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or through the pro@@ per ch@@ an@@ n@@ el@@ s .
Mr President , I really must say that I am quite a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed at how one can man@@ age , in a debate about an e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or , to say that one was a res@@ er@@ ve o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ er in the G@@ er@@ m@@ an ar@@ my and a &quot; positive &quot; m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the g@@ en@@ er@@ ation of 6@@ 8 and to t@@ al@@ k about st@@ one @-@ th@@ ro@@ w@@ ing members of the 6@@ 8 M@@ o@@ v@@ ement .
I do not know what one has g@@ o@@ t to do with the other , a@@ part perhaps from the fact that Mr K@@ n@@ ol@@ le f@@ el@@ t com@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed to te@@ l@@ l us a little of his own b@@ i@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y , but this is perhaps not without interest either .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ tions of my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , the e@@ v@@ ents in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or are d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c and we have he@@ ar@@ d many s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers state quite cor@@ rec@@ tly that if the question being as@@ k@@ ed here is how qu@@ ic@@ k and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent our aid is , then in the case of this natural c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he it does actually se@@ e@@ m to be ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ing qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , our in@@ it@@ i@@ al assistance I mean .
what concerns us , however - and what also ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised the discussion about the motion and how it should be wor@@ ded in our group - is the fact that we know from ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence that this has not always been the case .
on the one hand , therefore , this is about im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate help for the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st of the p@@ o@@ or , who need our s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity , but on the other hand it is also about the fact that we need to be@@ a@@ r in mind that our aid is f@@ u@@ ti@@ le if it b@@ ec@@ om@@ es ent@@ an@@ g@@ led in a j@@ un@@ g@@ le of red ta@@ p@@ e .
that is why we are g@@ la@@ d that this motion has been d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted j@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ly by se@@ ver@@ al groups .
we hope , Commissioner N@@ i@@ el@@ s@@ on , that the Commission will work just as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly on this motion as Parliament has .
as for Mr K@@ n@@ ol@@ le , I hope that he does not en@@ c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter any st@@ one @-@ th@@ ro@@ w@@ ing f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n min@@ is@@ ters .
Mr President , let me re@@ p@@ ly to Mr S@@ e@@ g@@ ur@@ o , who t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about the situation in H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s .
I want to make it clear that as part of our decision last year , su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by this House , to increase our st@@ a@@ k@@ e in the whole H@@ I@@ P@@ C initiative - EUR 1@@ b@@ n , we dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed to s@@ pen@@ d it g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ ally , not just on the A@@ C@@ P countries .
the reason for this was that , as a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch , H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s was in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded in the H@@ I@@ P@@ C initiative .
we n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to find a b@@ u@@ d@@ get line ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e European D@@ e@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ment F@@ un@@ d money to make it possible for the European Union to be even @-@ h@@ an@@ ded and support H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s .
H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s will rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve EUR 1@@ 5@@ m as de@@ b@@ t al@@ le@@ v@@ i@@ ation from us because of this .
this is , of course , in addition to what H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s is rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing from the H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch m@@ i@@ d@@ - and long @-@ term re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation and re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion follow @-@ up as part of the regional programme .
se@@ ver@@ al Members have raised concerns about the s@@ l@@ o@@ w d@@ el@@ i@@ very of the more long @-@ term re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion part of the H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch follow @-@ up .
I can only agree with the c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m .
I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f have ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ised this as a real s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al .
it to@@ o@@ k al@@ most one and a h@@ al@@ f years for the Commission services to find the si@@ x to se@@ v@@ en people to s@@ en@@ d to M@@ an@@ ag@@ u@@ a to form the uni@@ t to r@@ u@@ n the implementation of the regional re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme of EUR 2@@ 5@@ 0@@ m .
this is pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c .
it is not just b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y , it is a to@@ t@@ ally d@@ y@@ s@@ f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ al set @-@ up of different parties who do not t@@ al@@ k to each other .
this is ex@@ ac@@ tly why I am still in the market for more T@@ N@@ T to b@@ l@@ o@@ w up those kind of st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res which are b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ king good per@@ for@@ man@@ ce in the Commission .
the situation today for the implementation of this programme is that these people have now been working in M@@ an@@ ag@@ u@@ a since e@@ ar@@ ly a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n .
of the EUR 2@@ 5@@ 0@@ m , we have s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally e@@ ar@@ mar@@ k@@ ed and st@@ ar@@ ted the ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion in a number of the st@@ a@@ tes co@@ v@@ e@@ red by the re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme of more than EUR 8@@ 0@@ m .
so EUR 8@@ 0@@ m out of EUR 2@@ 5@@ 0 are now set to work .
things are finally st@@ ar@@ ting to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en on the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
I still want to make the very clear d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion - which I ur@@ ge everyone who has s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ en in this debate to no@@ te - between the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an sh@@ or@@ t @-@ term res@@ p@@ on@@ se to dis@@ a@@ st@@ er and the long @-@ term re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion work .
they are two to@@ t@@ ally d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ t t@@ y@@ p@@ es of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity and this has to be b@@ or@@ n@@ e in mind .
nothing has mo@@ v@@ ed s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly in the H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch follow @-@ up , ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t , as I mentioned here , fin@@ ding se@@ v@@ en people to s@@ en@@ d to M@@ an@@ ag@@ u@@ a .
but this is b@@ a@@ d enough .
let me now t@@ u@@ r@@ n more s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally to the ter@@ ri@@ ble situation in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
of course , the Commission fully s@@ ha@@ res the con@@ st@@ er@@ n@@ ation and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed in Parliament &apos;s resolution on the ter@@ ri@@ ble e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e which st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ k se@@ ver@@ al countries of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a , and in particular E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or .
the Commission - President P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , Mr P@@ att@@ en and m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f - im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed its con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s and the authorities and an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ed a qu@@ ic@@ k and e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent Community res@@ p@@ on@@ se to this c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he .
as in the past , when it as@@ s@@ is@@ ted E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or after the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 6 e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e through the con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of a new h@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ it@@ al and pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed very su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an and re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion aid to the countries st@@ u@@ c@@ k by H@@ ur@@ r@@ ic@@ an@@ e M@@ it@@ ch , the Commission st@@ an@@ ds re@@ ad@@ y to help C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a and E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or to f@@ ac@@ e the present d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es .
as s@@ o@@ on as the e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ e o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red the Commission h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an aid o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ e , E@@ C@@ H@@ O , di@@ rec@@ ted a field ex@@ per@@ t st@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ ed in H@@ on@@ d@@ u@@ ra@@ s to go di@@ rec@@ tly to the sc@@ en@@ e and he was there by S@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ y .
E@@ C@@ H@@ O also ar@@ r@@ an@@ ged this M@@ on@@ day for a mis@@ sion to be s@@ ent to make an in@@ it@@ i@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the needs as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds cooperation with other d@@ on@@ or@@ s and the local authorities .
it le@@ f@@ t y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day .
on M@@ on@@ day I dec@@ i@@ d@@ ed that the first res@@ p@@ on@@ se in terms of money should be EUR 2 m .
this would co@@ v@@ er the things that we k@@ new would be necessary in any case .
without any t@@ y@@ p@@ e of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation or further st@@ u@@ d@@ ying , it was clear that d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter , s@@ an@@ it@@ ation , sh@@ el@@ ter , food aid and m@@ ed@@ ical su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ es would be n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
we also were im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly clear as to the organisations we should ask to take c@@ are of this on behalf of the Commission , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of European N@@ G@@ O@@ s and the R@@ ed C@@ ro@@ s@@ s family .
we will follow up these in@@ it@@ i@@ al decisions with further com@@ m@@ it@@ ments , de@@ pen@@ ding on the fe@@ ed@@ back we get on what we are going to do com@@ pa@@ red to other d@@ on@@ or@@ s and so on .
let me ad@@ d here that this ter@@ ri@@ ble c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he once again pro@@ v@@ es that p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty as such is d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous .
most people think that e@@ ar@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ es and these t@@ y@@ p@@ es of c@@ a@@ ta@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he are much more d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ ing in our s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ ated s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es with all the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate infrastructure we have , yet in E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence has been that more than 5@@ 0 % of w@@ a@@ ter pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on to the whole n@@ ation is c@@ u@@ t o@@ f@@ f because of d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to p@@ i@@ p@@ es , el@@ ec@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ity et@@ c .
so the se@@ con@@ d@@ ary impact is en@@ or@@ m@@ ous , often because the systems are v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able , not f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing very well .
for in@@ st@@ ance the f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ ing in M@@ o@@ z@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ qu@@ e c@@ a@@ u@@ sed much greater d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to d@@ a@@ m@@ s , road , b@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ g@@ es and so on than it would have done if the country had had n@@ or@@ ma@@ l , well @-@ ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed , st@@ r@@ on@@ g and more ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve infrastructure .
so p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty is d@@ an@@ g@@ er@@ ous , and this has to be k@@ e@@ p@@ t in mind .
for this reason , we are g@@ i@@ v@@ ing more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s to dis@@ a@@ st@@ er pre@@ pa@@ re@@ d@@ ness ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities as part of our h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an assistance .
we are also con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing as f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ b@@ ly as possible the re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for a r@@ e @-@ or@@ i@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of resources available in Commission @-@ su@@ p@@ por@@ ted development projects in the z@@ on@@ es and se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted , including those f@@ o@@ re@@ seen in the framework of the p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ M@@ it@@ ch re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme .
my view here is that we need ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al resources for this .
it is not acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to di@@ ver@@ t money from the p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ M@@ it@@ ch re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion programme which has had enough problems already due to our b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es , but it is an as@@ set that we have a uni@@ t in place in the region which con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ s of people who are s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed in these kind of re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities .
of course , this is an as@@ set and we will defin@@ it@@ el@@ y come back to the more long @-@ term problems for E@@ l S@@ al@@ va@@ d@@ or when we get be@@ y@@ on@@ d the im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate h@@ u@@ man@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an res@@ p@@ on@@ se .
so I thank you for the very st@@ r@@ on@@ g support here .
we will come back on how to do these things .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote will take place at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
I now t@@ u@@ r@@ n also to c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in their o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es who should be here not at 6@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , as st@@ a@@ ted on the pr@@ in@@ ted programme , but at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , de@@ pen@@ ding on when we are able to be@@ g@@ in the vote .
the President already said at m@@ i@@ d@@ day today that it would be 6 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , and it may be that it will be 5@@ .@@ 5@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , and de@@ pen@@ ding on the result of the vote on Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s request it may even take place e@@ ar@@ li@@ er than that .
I would therefore request , in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the decision of the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents , that you p@@ le@@ a@@ se ask your c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es to come into the pl@@ en@@ ary as e@@ ar@@ ly as 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . for the vote and help us to ensure that we are all here at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m .
( the s@@ it@@ ting was su@@ s@@ pen@@ ded at 5@@ .@@ 1@@ 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . and re@@ su@@ m@@ ed at 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ .@@ m@@ . )
long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa
the next it@@ e@@ m is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 3@@ 8@@ 8 / 2000 ) by Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , on behalf of the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs , on the initiative of the French R@@ e@@ public with a view to ad@@ op@@ ting a Council R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion on freedom of movement with a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
ex@@ c@@ use me , Mr President , but I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t that you had received an o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al request to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one my report to a la@@ ter part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
I have not received an o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al request , I was in fact w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for an o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al request .
that is why I d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ ed s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly in an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ing the debate , but ap@@ par@@ ently no one w@@ is@@ h@@ ed to approach the Presidency .
Mr President , as far as I am aware , a si@@ g@@ n@@ ed d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment was su@@ b@@ m@@ it@@ ted to you e@@ ar@@ li@@ er on behalf of the Group of the G@@ re@@ en@@ s / European F@@ re@@ e A@@ l@@ li@@ ance .
therefore , I as@@ su@@ me that you have received it .
and , again , as far as I am aware , this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment is v@@ al@@ i@@ d .
this certainly s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that the President of this s@@ it@@ ting is u@@ t@@ ter@@ ly im@@ par@@ ti@@ al .
I have not received this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment , but I take it that what you say is t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
you are aware of the procedure concerning re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s to p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ one a report , we take a s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er in favour of the request , then one against , and then , if necessary , we he@@ a@@ r from the rapporteur .
Mr President , I was d@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ c@@ ted by Mr K@@ n@@ ol@@ le , but I will s@@ par@@ e you the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s of what he w@@ an@@ ted to te@@ l@@ l me .
those who were in the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er just now know what I mean .
if I re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er cor@@ rec@@ tly , Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z w@@ an@@ ted his report to be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed .
now I do not know why I have been given the f@@ l@@ o@@ or first .
as rapporteur , he has in fact not yet t@@ ol@@ d us why he is re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ing this p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ement .
that is why it would be only f@@ a@@ i@@ r for you to give h@@ i@@ m the f@@ l@@ o@@ or first .
a@@ f@@ ter@@ w@@ ar@@ ds I will give my opinion and that of my group on this .
as a r@@ u@@ le , we ask for a s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er in favour of p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ing the report .
you were the first to ra@@ ise your hand , Mr S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z , you were the qu@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ t .
however , I would , n@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , like to allow Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z to speak .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing &apos; s s@@ it@@ ting , the President in@@ for@@ m@@ ed the House that the Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i &apos; s report had been p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed to a la@@ ter part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
at that point , I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted that the report that I had wor@@ k@@ ed on and which , mo@@ re@@ over , was un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly adopted by the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs , would be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed until this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
however , in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , I was in@@ for@@ m@@ ed that most of the people who had taken part in this debate in my committee , and who I h@@ op@@ ed would be able to speak before the House , had unfortunately s@@ ent their ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es as they were un@@ able to take part in the debate .
this a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts more than h@@ al@@ f of the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who were to att@@ end this debate on a matter on which we are b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally at od@@ ds with the Council , since , in the legal basis , there is a con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tion between what I pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e and what is acc@@ e@@ p@@ ta@@ ble to the Council , and this is l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to have si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ant consequences for th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people who , every year , would like to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from free movement in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area .
R@@ e@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ fully , then , I have had to no@@ te the ab@@ s@@ ence of Mr W@@ at@@ s@@ on , c@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the committee ; Mr P@@ ir@@ k@@ er , co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ to@@ r of the Group of the European P@@ e@@ op@@ le &apos; s Party ; Mrs T@@ er@@ r@@ ó@@ n I C@@ u@@ s@@ i , who was due to speak and who is co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ a@@ to@@ r of the Group of the Party of European S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t@@ s , and Mr H@@ er@@ n@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z M@@ ol@@ la@@ r , who also s@@ en@@ ds his ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es , being un@@ able to att@@ end , as well as two other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers .
in these c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , concerning a matter where we re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e all the political groups to adopt a clear position , where it is a question of f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l conflict between Parliament and the Council , I b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed that it was important to have an in @-@ de@@ p@@ th debate and a full vote .
that is why I request that this report be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed until Parliament &apos; s next part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in principle I support Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s request .
I also support it on behalf of my group , because we believe that this is such an important issue - as Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z has said - that it re@@ qu@@ i@@ res the attention of the whole House .
and he has put forward a per@@ su@@ a@@ si@@ ve ar@@ gu@@ ment that many of the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who com@@ m@@ en@@ ted on this in the committee and who w@@ an@@ ted to speak this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing are no longer here .
what was right for the F@@ er@@ r@@ i report this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing must also apply to the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
but of course I should also like to qu@@ al@@ i@@ fy this by sa@@ ying that we cannot d@@ en@@ y that this debate is , a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st other things , about an agenda and c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ a@@ r problem .
if we do not change our min@@ ds and make both T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day and F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y working d@@ a@@ y@@ s here , then we will dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s this problem over and over again every T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
in my opinion this can be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed by c@@ re@@ ating a co@@ h@@ er@@ ent and in@@ ter@@ n@@ ally l@@ o@@ g@@ ical system for doing our work which r@@ un@@ s until F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
in this specific case Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z has a right to have better att@@ en@@ d@@ ance than he has now .
Mr President , of course I en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly agree with Mr S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z &apos;s last point , but I should like this once to state quite clearly that , now that the F@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y s@@ it@@ ting has been ab@@ ol@@ is@@ h@@ ed , there is a s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n to ab@@ ol@@ ish the T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day s@@ it@@ ting too .
on the other hand , the res@@ p@@ on@@ ses to this are far from s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c .
on M@@ on@@ day , Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en said that his report was too important to be taken on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , following Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en &apos;s s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h , this House made a d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c decision to take his report on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
then at m@@ i@@ d@@ day on W@@ ed@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ day , the President of the s@@ it@@ ting ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed that with the agreement of the groups Mr S@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ä@@ n@@ en &apos;s report would be mo@@ v@@ ed to T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day m@@ or@@ n@@ ing .
this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing we were p@@ res@@ en@@ ted with an agenda , out of which it em@@ er@@ ged that the F@@ er@@ r@@ i and D@@ e@@ pre@@ z reports would be de@@ al@@ t with this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing .
this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing no@@ b@@ od@@ y pro@@ te@@ st@@ ed against this .
at l@@ u@@ n@@ ch@@ time Mr F@@ er@@ r@@ i re@@ al@@ is@@ ed that he would be le@@ a@@ v@@ ing and as@@ k@@ ed for his report to be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed .
his request was g@@ r@@ an@@ ted , and Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z s@@ at there and did not pro@@ te@@ st .
this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z re@@ al@@ is@@ ed that his s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers had g@@ one a@@ st@@ ra@@ y and now this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing he w@@ an@@ ts his report to be p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ed .
this is l@@ o@@ o@@ king in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly like a P@@ un@@ ch and J@@ u@@ d@@ y s@@ how , I really do have to say .
I should like very clearly to op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e this p@@ o@@ st@@ p@@ on@@ ement .
Mr S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z , Mrs B@@ ou@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ en@@ e @-@ T@@ h@@ i@@ er@@ y and I are Members of this committee .
we can a@@ i@@ r our v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on this issue , and we should go a@@ he@@ a@@ d with the debate .
however , I would hope that pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ in@@ g@@ s could be more or@@ d@@ er@@ ly in the future .
Mr President , I shall be taking more than fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ tes , because the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers from my group who have w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n have le@@ f@@ t 1@@ 5 min@@ u@@ tes .
therefore , I can take 20 min@@ u@@ tes .
so , Mr President , I shall speak as s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly as appropriate , because I believe that you do not in@@ t@@ end to dis@@ allow a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine debate that in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es a full p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion of each ar@@ gu@@ ment .
Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , I shall apply the R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
you have been al@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ted fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ tes and I shall allow you to speak for fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ tes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my report is based on an initiative by the French R@@ e@@ public concerning third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als , who are h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers of what is called a national long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa ; in other words , one v@@ al@@ i@@ d for no more than three m@@ on@@ th@@ s , which has been is@@ su@@ ed by a Member State of the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area .
these third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als are a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing their re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ its in the Member State that ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed their en@@ t@@ r@@ y .
under current Community law , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y , A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 8 of the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als are only per@@ m@@ it@@ ted to t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t through the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of other Member States in order to re@@ ac@@ h the country which is@@ su@@ ed the long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
following their ar@@ ri@@ va@@ l in this country , third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als cannot tra@@ v@@ e@@ l any further within the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area until they have ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed what is called a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it .
this is ex@@ ac@@ tly where the problem li@@ es . it can take se@@ ver@@ al w@@ e@@ e@@ ks , if not se@@ ver@@ al m@@ on@@ th@@ s , for a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it to be is@@ su@@ ed , ma@@ in@@ ly due to c@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ er@@ some ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures , p@@ o@@ or co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive de@@ par@@ t@@ ments in some Member States , and because the per@@ s@@ on concerned has di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty in fin@@ ding out the cor@@ rec@@ t procedure to follow .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , and this concerns th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people every year throughout the Union , a h@@ ol@@ d@@ er of a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa and who has not yet received a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it , is in the least f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble position by com@@ par@@ is@@ on with other third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als as far as freedom of movement in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area is concerned .
the fact that a whole ra@@ f@@ t of extremely st@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ent conditions must be f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ l@@ ed , in each of our countries , in order to ob@@ ta@@ in a national long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa makes this situation even more par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ ical , and , to my mind , even more s@@ c@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ ous .
a@@ part from cases in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing family re@@ uni@@ on , ap@@ pl@@ ic@@ an@@ ts for long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as are su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to a pre@@ l@@ im@@ in@@ ary in @-@ de@@ p@@ th en@@ qu@@ ir@@ y .
they must pro@@ ve that they have a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate resources and , de@@ pen@@ ding on the c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es , pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce either a d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment to c@@ er@@ ti@@ fy that they have been acc@@ e@@ p@@ ted in an ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al or re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment , or a v@@ al@@ i@@ d employment con@@ tra@@ c@@ t .
the objective of the French R@@ e@@ public is si@@ m@@ p@@ le and is very clearly st@@ a@@ ted in the E@@ x@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y S@@ ta@@ te@@ ment .
the a@@ i@@ m is to en@@ able freedom of movement in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area for h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers of a national long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa who are a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing their re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it .
all of us , or so I hope , at least , share this objective which a@@ im@@ s to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate freedom of movement for these n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als .
therefore , the problem li@@ es not in the objective itself , but in the way that the French R@@ e@@ public has ch@@ o@@ s@@ en to achieve this g@@ o@@ al and the consequences of this in terms of the dis@@ c@@ re@@ ti@@ on@@ ary p@@ o@@ w@@ ers of Member States with regard to citizens &apos; rights .
it is rather sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing that the French R@@ e@@ public initiative ta@@ k@@ es A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ l@@ es 6@@ 2 ( 2 ) and 6@@ 3 ( 3 ) as its legal basis , as both of these re@@ la@@ te to procedures and conditions for is@@ su@@ ing v@@ is@@ as .
yet , if the real a@@ i@@ m of the initiative is to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate freedom of movement for n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als , the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red legal basis is A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 6@@ 2 ( 3 ) , which st@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tes that the Council shall , within a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of fi@@ ve years of the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am &apos; s en@@ t@@ r@@ y into force , adopt measures se@@ t@@ t@@ ing out the conditions under which n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als of third countries shall have the freedom to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l within the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of the Member States during a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of no more than three m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
ladies and gentlemen , the c@@ h@@ o@@ ice of legal basis is n@@ e@@ v@@ er an in@@ no@@ c@@ ent c@@ h@@ o@@ ice .
in re@@ al@@ ity , the legal basis s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted in the French initiative pro@@ v@@ es that the main a@@ i@@ m of this initiative is to h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ ise conditions for is@@ su@@ ing long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as by b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing them into line with uni@@ form sh@@ or@@ t @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as .
this means that , if we accept the proposal as p@@ res@@ en@@ ted by the French R@@ e@@ public , it would give any Member State involved in the c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r cooperation under the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement the right to be in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of all re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa made in every other country of the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area , through what is called the p@@ ri@@ or con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure , and , as a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence , it would be able to b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k the freedom of movement by per@@ s@@ ons that this country does not ap@@ pro@@ ve .
in practice , if we accept these ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , it would mean that , through the p@@ ri@@ or con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure , the French government could request to be s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally in@@ for@@ m@@ ed if S@@ pa@@ in were to issue a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa to an A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ an national t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and it would have the right to ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t to the request , without an@@ y@@ one &apos; s k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , because currently no one k@@ no@@ ws which countries make use of the p@@ ri@@ or con@@ su@@ l@@ ta@@ tion procedure and the Council re@@ f@@ u@@ ses to re@@ le@@ a@@ se the l@@ is@@ t of countries .
therefore , I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f ch@@ o@@ s@@ e to a@@ m@@ en@@ d the initiative of the French R@@ e@@ public in order to bring it into line with the st@@ a@@ ted objective , as set out in the E@@ x@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y S@@ ta@@ te@@ ment , which is to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the movement of h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers of a national long @-@ term visa while a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing their re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it .
mo@@ re@@ over , I support the a@@ i@@ m to implement a uni@@ form long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa system , as already currently ex@@ is@@ t@@ s for sh@@ or@@ t @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as .
however , I hope , and I believe that we should all hope , that this initiative should be part of a clear , con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent , over@@ all proposal from the Council and not part of an initiative which is s@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ ch@@ y in sc@@ op@@ e and s@@ ha@@ k@@ y in its ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents , like this one .
that is why I shall ask the House to accept the amendments that I have made with the full support of the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs .
Mr President , I am gra@@ te@@ ful for the opportunity to speak for the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
this is not the only issue concerning le@@ g@@ ally re@@ si@@ d@@ ent third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als where we have a problem concerning the appropriate legal b@@ a@@ se .
I am th@@ in@@ king , for example , of the ex@@ t@@ en@@ si@@ ons of the 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ 8 / 7@@ 1 R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion concerning the co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation of social security systems .
the T@@ a@@ m@@ per@@ e S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ it in 1999 s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e of acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r rights to third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als as those en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed by EU citizens .
yet we still have those who wish to view them as sh@@ or@@ t @-@ term tra@@ v@@ el@@ l@@ ers , rather than as people who have much con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the Union .
o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise why would our governments be so k@@ e@@ en to encourage in@@ w@@ ar@@ d in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment from A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an and A@@ si@@ an com@@ p@@ an@@ ies ?
we believe we need political co@@ h@@ er@@ ence in our policy @-@ making in this area .
the lack of such co@@ h@@ er@@ ence par@@ tly ex@@ pla@@ in@@ s the ar@@ gu@@ ment over the legal b@@ a@@ se .
the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the view taken by the rapporteur , Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , and th@@ an@@ ks h@@ i@@ m for his d@@ il@@ i@@ g@@ ence in this matter .
it was our committee &apos;s view that we could re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the number of such dis@@ ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with the Council in future by re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the number of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al national initiatives in this area and l@@ o@@ o@@ king in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d for Commission proposals which go through an in@@ it@@ i@@ al v@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing procedure .
I know that the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs has already raised this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it be@@ ar@@ s f@@ r@@ u@@ it .
on the su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ tive issue , while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , of course , it se@@ em@@ ed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als into line with those of citizens .
this is particularly important where par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , not par@@ ents as it sa@@ y@@ s in my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ y st@@ a@@ te@@ ment for some very st@@ r@@ an@@ ge reason , are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted by a different legal st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s , and we have had a number of p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons on these issues which we ad@@ ded to our opinion .
we f@@ el@@ t it was also important to support the position of Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c d@@ el@@ a@@ y than decision @-@ making .
it is our hope and ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion also that the Committee on P@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ons will a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally be as@@ k@@ ed for an opinion in good time on such issues in future .
Mr President , I should like first of all to congratulate Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z on his b@@ r@@ il@@ li@@ ant report which d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es our full support .
we have of course wor@@ k@@ ed very h@@ ar@@ d on this report in our Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs .
my de@@ a@@ r Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z , I could not have w@@ is@@ h@@ ed for a better time for this report to be de@@ al@@ t with , because this is an excellent time - w@@ h@@ en@@ ever Parliament s@@ it@@ s is an excellent time - but I would have w@@ is@@ h@@ ed you better s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers .
but ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of this , I believe that the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who will now take the f@@ l@@ o@@ or in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of the or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ al s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers are per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly able to make a contribution to this debate .
I should like to say quite clearly that both Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s com@@ ments on the legal basis and his c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m of the Council and the Commission &apos;s approach to this area d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ve our full support .
the Council and the Commission are ac@@ ting just as un@@ s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally on this important issue as we al@@ most did just now and as we have done this w@@ e@@ e@@ k regarding the agenda .
where a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion are concerned we are de@@ al@@ ing with a com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly con@@ f@@ u@@ sed policy where in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al initiatives are put to us one after another - s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es by the Council , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es by the Commission , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es by in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States - but where there is no st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c approach .
but this is also p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y what this proposal - which is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly s@@ en@@ si@@ ble in practice - is su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from .
there is no st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c approach which d@@ ra@@ ws a clear d@@ is@@ t@@ in@@ c@@ tion between a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m and im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion , which re@@ gu@@ la@@ tes both ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ a@@ te@@ ly and which de@@ als with the important issue of b@@ ur@@ d@@ en @-@ sh@@ ar@@ ing , and all of this g@@ i@@ v@@ es r@@ ise to problems .
these problems are then once again res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed by the back d@@ o@@ or by means of b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , and they are not res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed for good : these are p@@ se@@ u@@ d@@ o @-@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions .
if this initiative really does make the li@@ v@@ es of those people who have a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa in the European Union e@@ a@@ si@@ er then I welcome it .
but you cannot t@@ re@@ at c@@ an@@ c@@ er with as@@ p@@ ir@@ in .
the way in which we have h@@ an@@ d@@ led this important field in the last few years - and unfortunately still do so - cannot be al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed to continue .
that is why I believe that Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s c@@ r@@ it@@ ical com@@ ments are more than j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied .
p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al e@@ as@@ ing of re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions in the interests of people , y@@ es .
s@@ en@@ si@@ ble b@@ ur@@ d@@ en @-@ sh@@ ar@@ ing where b@@ ur@@ d@@ en@@ s ar@@ ise , y@@ es .
and of course free movement for third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als within the European Union .
but we call on the Council and the Commission finally to mo@@ ve from p@@ at@@ ch @-@ up j@@ o@@ b@@ s to a s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c , st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c policy in this area and to present an over@@ all , uni@@ fied v@@ is@@ i@@ on through which we can mo@@ ve st@@ e@@ p by st@@ e@@ p .
Mr President , I should like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ tion .
when we were t@@ al@@ king this a@@ f@@ ter@@ no@@ on and I would have had to be@@ g@@ in my s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h with the p@@ h@@ ra@@ se , &quot; Mr President , ab@@ s@@ ent f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds , &quot; because al@@ together fi@@ ve c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es were present , Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t said that if there were no other s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers there from his group a@@ part from h@@ i@@ m , he would take over all of the P@@ P@@ E Group &apos;s s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king time .
this would have m@@ e@@ ant that we would have had to l@@ is@@ t@@ en to Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t for a whole fi@@ f@@ te@@ en min@@ u@@ tes .
i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that !
now this c@@ up has pa@@ s@@ sed from us and we can t@@ u@@ r@@ n to the issue ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed by Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z .
Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t , b@@ ur@@ d@@ en @-@ sh@@ ar@@ ing , which you t@@ al@@ k@@ ed about - one of your f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ ite su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts - has nothing to do with what we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing today , although I do con@@ c@@ ed@@ e that we need to t@@ al@@ k about b@@ ur@@ d@@ en @-@ sh@@ ar@@ ing .
allow me first of all to say to the Council that we are de@@ al@@ ing with an initiative of the French Government , and rec@@ ently in the Committee on C@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ s &apos; F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and Rights , J@@ u@@ st@@ ice and H@@ om@@ e Affairs we have seen in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al Member States taking initiatives time and again , and we have then seen that the Member States s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to be mis@@ taken about their c@@ h@@ o@@ ice of legal basis .
for once I will d@@ are to take up something which Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t said .
there is no st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan , particularly in the Council .
that is why the Council would be better ad@@ v@@ is@@ ed to adopt Commissioner V@@ it@@ or@@ in@@ o &apos;s st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan , which is actually available , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ king most of his i@@ d@@ e@@ as .
I say this as a point of principle to the Member States and the Council itself .
my second point is , why is there no st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan ?
there is no st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan for one si@@ m@@ p@@ le reason .
we are de@@ al@@ ing with a de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan because we t@@ al@@ k about the free movement of services , c@@ ap@@ it@@ al and g@@ o@@ od@@ s , and from c@@ att@@ le to uranium they can mo@@ ve ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d f@@ re@@ el@@ y in Europe .
it is only people who are subject to re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions in the European Union .
they are su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to these re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tions because of a de@@ f@@ ence m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m .
when Mr P@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ t t@@ al@@ ks about freedom of movement , he ma@@ in@@ ly means people from the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n h@@ em@@ is@@ p@@ here or a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m se@@ e@@ k@@ ers .
but I am t@@ al@@ king , say , about an A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ an prof@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or who acc@@ e@@ p@@ ts a c@@ ha@@ i@@ r at a G@@ er@@ m@@ an uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ es a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it for the F@@ ed@@ er@@ al R@@ e@@ public of G@@ er@@ many and who , when he w@@ is@@ h@@ es to give a gu@@ est le@@ c@@ ture at the S@@ or@@ b@@ on@@ n@@ e in P@@ ar@@ is has to apply for a visa , which he is p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly still w@@ a@@ it@@ ing for because the French or G@@ er@@ m@@ an authorities are not making progress on it . this is because of the di@@ ver@@ se and - for the lack of a st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c plan - very he@@ te@@ ro@@ g@@ en@@ e@@ ous ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in the Member States .
I am t@@ al@@ king about the en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ er who is s@@ ent from a third @-@ country to the EU by a f@@ ir@@ m which has o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es in various different l@@ o@@ c@@ ations .
he is su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to the same b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , which in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally ou@@ g@@ h@@ t not to ex@@ is@@ t at all in a free market and in a free ec@@ on@@ om@@ y .
that is why , in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s excellent report , I call on you , when you are de@@ b@@ ating the freedom of movement and its regulation , not only always to em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y a de@@ f@@ ence m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m against those w@@ h@@ o@@ m we su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ se@@ d@@ ly or really do not want here , but finally to re@@ al@@ ise firstly that freedom of movement is a human right and secondly that it makes economic s@@ en@@ se in the European Union .
( ap@@ pla@@ use )
ladies and gentlemen , the French initiative that we are dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing today once again d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ tes the importance of c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ying all the measures on free movement which present the problem of op@@ en@@ ing up b@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
all the st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s s@@ how that m@@ i@@ gra@@ t@@ or@@ y f@@ l@@ o@@ ws have not d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ed and that they will even increase over the com@@ ing years .
therefore , the problem of free movement of third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als within the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area will again re@@ a@@ r its he@@ a@@ d and become even more ac@@ u@@ te .
yet , the citizens of Europe ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t a clear and con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ent over@@ all policy on m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
the amendment of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 8 of the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement is the key el@@ ement of the French initiative .
a h@@ ol@@ d@@ er of a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa should not en@@ j@@ o@@ y fe@@ w@@ er rights than a per@@ s@@ on who h@@ ol@@ ds a sh@@ or@@ t @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
the issue is to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the free movement of m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts who re@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n h@@ om@@ e re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly , w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er visa they h@@ ol@@ d .
we should be aware that , currently , third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als may only t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t through the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of another Member State in order to re@@ ac@@ h the country which is@@ su@@ ed their long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
from then on , they can no longer mo@@ ve ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d within the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area until they have ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it .
this is where the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty li@@ es .
in terms of the principle of free movement , third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als with a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa are in the most un@@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble position , even though they might have had to w@@ a@@ it se@@ ver@@ al m@@ on@@ th@@ s or even years to ob@@ ta@@ in the visa .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the te@@ x@@ t of the French initiative om@@ its the problem of family re@@ uni@@ on , a problem which ar@@ is@@ es in particular when citizens of the Union mar@@ r@@ y third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als .
why not therefore t@@ re@@ at those who h@@ ol@@ d a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa as already re@@ si@@ d@@ ent so that they can en@@ j@@ o@@ y the same right to freedom of movement ?
as Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z also h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted , the legal basis of the proposal could have been en@@ v@@ is@@ ag@@ ed in a different way so that it co@@ v@@ e@@ red all aspects mentioned in these ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ em@@ ents .
to su@@ m up , it se@@ em@@ s right to re@@ j@@ ec@@ t an im@@ p@@ rec@@ ise and in@@ com@@ p@@ le@@ te initiative re@@ la@@ ting to a matter as s@@ en@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ve as Community im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion policy .
in order to respect and fully guarantee Community le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive power , we must ur@@ g@@ ently adopt legislation on rights to freedom of movement , im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and a@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ u@@ m .
the only way to pre@@ v@@ ent a F@@ or@@ t@@ res@@ s Europe being b@@ u@@ il@@ t is to make our re@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve visa policy con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ab@@ ly more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble . the current system does nothing to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the m@@ i@@ gra@@ t@@ or@@ y f@@ l@@ o@@ w , on the con@@ t@@ r@@ ary , it en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ es n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks of s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ ers of il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts to th@@ ri@@ ve .
Mr President , I ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly agree with Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z .
this is a really important issue which g@@ o@@ es to the whole he@@ ar@@ t of why we have the European Union .
the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the Union are freedom , respect for democracy , human rights , and if you re@@ mo@@ ve freedom of movement , if you st@@ i@@ g@@ ma@@ t@@ ise people because they have ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed for a visa or they h@@ ol@@ d a particular t@@ y@@ p@@ e of visa , I believe you under@@ min@@ e the f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the Union .
that is why I welcome the b@@ road th@@ r@@ u@@ st of Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s report .
it is a well @-@ con@@ si@@ de@@ red report and , as he said quite ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly , it is re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people .
but even if it was re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to only one per@@ s@@ on , we would still be ac@@ ting , I am a@@ f@@ ra@@ i@@ d , years , dec@@ ad@@ es , after the time when we should have ac@@ ted .
it is , as he said , a means to achieve a g@@ o@@ al and I welcome his legal basis of A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 6@@ 2 ( 3 ) .
I share Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s concerns and his amendments a@@ f@@ for@@ d freedom of movement for those a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing a defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve visa .
I welcome his re@@ fin@@ ement of the French proposals .
there is a real need for these proposals .
we must t@@ re@@ at people f@@ a@@ ir@@ ly and with di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and re@@ mo@@ ve the st@@ i@@ g@@ m@@ a of visa st@@ a@@ y@@ s .
some Member States will have res@@ er@@ va@@ tions , but we must rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise that change is essential and that people must not be pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed in terms of their freedom of movement by un@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ able and c@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ er@@ some ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive procedures .
I congratulate Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z on an in@@ te@@ l@@ li@@ g@@ ent and re@@ as@@ on@@ ed approach , with measures that f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate freedom of movement for third @-@ country n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als on Member State ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies for a ma@@ x@@ im@@ u@@ m per@@ i@@ o@@ d of three m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
this is a guarantee .
we should welcome it and therefore welcome his report .
finally , perhaps this report will at some time en@@ able us in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er and in the Union to have a ra@@ ti@@ on@@ al and re@@ as@@ on@@ able debate on im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and visa issues , dec@@ ou@@ pl@@ ed from the u@@ g@@ l@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s of n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ m and x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ b@@ i@@ a .
I welcome Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z &apos;s report .
Mr President , on behalf of the Commission , I should like to o@@ f@@ f@@ er my con@@ gra@@ t@@ u@@ la@@ tions on the th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h and ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ ve work of the rapporteur , Mr D@@ e@@ pre@@ z .
the Commission su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the objective pu@@ r@@ su@@ ed by the French initiative to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate freedom of movement within the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area for h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers with long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as p@@ ri@@ or to the issue of a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment with e@@ qu@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ent st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s to a visa .
however , the Commission cannot support the s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted legal basis , which has ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous im@@ pl@@ ic@@ ations for the con@@ t@@ ent of the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment .
the Commission acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly s@@ ha@@ res your rapporteur &apos;s position .
it con@@ si@@ d@@ ers that the pro@@ per legal basis for this regulation is A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 6@@ 2 ( 3 ) of the E@@ C Treaty , &quot; measures se@@ t@@ t@@ ing out the conditions under which n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als of third countries shall have the freedom to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l within the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of the Member States during a per@@ i@@ o@@ d of no more than three m@@ on@@ th@@ s . &quot;
for the sa@@ k@@ e of con@@ s@@ is@@ t@@ ency with that legal basis , the Commission also ag@@ re@@ es with your rapporteur on the need to a@@ m@@ en@@ d A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 2@@ 1 of the C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion for the implementation of the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en A@@ g@@ re@@ ement , which re@@ gu@@ la@@ tes the movement of f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers , rather than A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 8 .
the la@@ t@@ ter ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le m@@ e@@ re@@ ly s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ies that long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as are is@@ su@@ ed on a national basis and se@@ ts the conditions for t@@ r@@ an@@ si@@ t by h@@ ol@@ d@@ ers of long @-@ st@@ a@@ y v@@ is@@ as .
the only further point that the Commission might ad@@ d to those made by the rapporteur is this : it re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the amendments to the C@@ om@@ m@@ on C@@ on@@ su@@ la@@ r In@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion as going far enough .
it is also necessary to a@@ m@@ en@@ d the C@@ om@@ m@@ on M@@ an@@ u@@ al so that b@@ order p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e can be in@@ for@@ m@@ ed of the new st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s of the long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
finally , the Commission can con@@ f@@ ir@@ m its in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of sh@@ or@@ tly p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing an over@@ all proposal for legislation as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the right to tra@@ v@@ e@@ l in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en area to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d f@@ ra@@ g@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y action that would not be con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ ve to transparency and c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity in the public mind or c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y as to the law .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate is c@@ l@@ o@@ sed .
the vote on the report will take place im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly after the v@@ o@@ tes on the to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of major importance , which are about to be@@ g@@ in .
vote ( con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation )
Mr President , this is the last ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation of vote of the part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion and if , with my f@@ o@@ o@@ t b@@ ro@@ k@@ en and in pla@@ st@@ er , I su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed in g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ing to the end of this last ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ation as well , I shall have some hope of not having put my f@@ o@@ o@@ t in it too often .
that said , I want to te@@ l@@ l you that I con@@ su@@ l@@ ted my d@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ter E@@ l@@ is@@ ab@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ a about this report . she is a young la@@ w@@ y@@ er and also a regional as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly m@@ em@@ b@@ er for the P@@ en@@ si@@ on@@ ers &apos; Party in L@@ om@@ b@@ ar@@ d@@ y .
her ad@@ v@@ ice as a la@@ w@@ y@@ er was to vote for the report as it st@@ o@@ o@@ d , because it would mean more cases and la@@ w@@ su@@ its .
but as a le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ to@@ r and as@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly m@@ em@@ b@@ er , she said she should do , and ad@@ v@@ is@@ ed me to do , what was best for the citizens , and vote for it only if it was a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed .
and that is what I have done , Mr President .
we should like to thank the F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ o family for their com@@ ments on the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report .
the directive proposed by the French R@@ e@@ public is based on the m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ition of de@@ por@@ ta@@ tion or@@ d@@ ers as s@@ o@@ on as they are is@@ su@@ ed by a Member State of the European Union .
the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e re@@ j@@ ec@@ ts this approach because , at a time when de@@ por@@ ta@@ tion or@@ d@@ ers are already being ab@@ used in various countries of the European Union , the new directive will f@@ o@@ st@@ er further v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of the law .
ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence has s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that the ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tive authorities are even pre@@ pa@@ red - all too pre@@ pa@@ red - to issue de@@ por@@ ta@@ tion or@@ d@@ ers against legal im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts who ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to v@@ i@@ ol@@ ate certain rules ( including the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ way c@@ od@@ e ) , using the pre@@ te@@ x@@ t of the th@@ re@@ at to public order and national security .
the new law on al@@ i@@ en@@ s currently pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing through the G@@ re@@ e@@ k par@@ li@@ a@@ ment con@@ ta@@ in@@ s pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on to this effect .
for these reasons , we voted against the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report .
the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report pro@@ p@@ o@@ ses that the h@@ ol@@ d@@ er of a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa who is a@@ w@@ a@@ it@@ ing a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it should en@@ j@@ o@@ y the same rights to freedom of movement as the h@@ ol@@ d@@ er of a re@@ si@@ d@@ ence per@@ m@@ it . this mar@@ ks an im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement on the French initiative which proposed that a long @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa should o@@ f@@ f@@ er the same rights in terms of movement as a sh@@ or@@ t @-@ st@@ a@@ y visa .
in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 6 , when , on the pre@@ te@@ x@@ t of com@@ b@@ ating ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , F@@ r@@ an@@ ce re@@ in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ t v@@ is@@ as , the European Parliament re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed that these be w@@ i@@ th@@ d@@ ra@@ w@@ n , per@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing &quot; dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation towards citizens of non @-@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er countries &quot; .
today , such dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation has been made com@@ m@@ on@@ place by the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en C@@ on@@ v@@ en@@ tion and by com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ it@@ is@@ ing policy on m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
v@@ is@@ as are re@@ f@@ u@@ sed by con@@ su@@ la@@ r o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ es that op@@ er@@ ate with a to@@ ta@@ l lack of transparency and ra@@ re@@ ly have to ex@@ pla@@ in their reasons .
European con@@ su@@ la@@ tes simply re@@ f@@ er to &quot; the m@@ i@@ gra@@ t@@ or@@ y r@@ is@@ k &quot; or re@@ g@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion in the S@@ ch@@ en@@ g@@ en In@@ for@@ ma@@ tion S@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ m .
in addition to the va@@ st number of o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al re@@ j@@ ec@@ tions , an in@@ c@@ al@@ c@@ u@@ la@@ ble number of ver@@ b@@ al re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s have been re@@ f@@ u@@ sed point @-@ b@@ l@@ an@@ k .
a good deal of tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king g@@ o@@ es on in con@@ su@@ la@@ tes because so few v@@ is@@ as are is@@ su@@ ed .
this con@@ st@@ ant h@@ u@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ ation of n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ als from the S@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n h@@ em@@ is@@ p@@ here has no pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t to st@@ o@@ p them c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ing b@@ or@@ d@@ ers and no effect ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t to encourage il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
the D@@ e@@ pre@@ z report ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es that there is a lack of transparency and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c control when it comes to v@@ is@@ as and movement in Europe .
that is why I shall vote in its favour .
A@@ d@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ment of the se@@ s@@ sion
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es the agenda .
I dec@@ l@@ are the se@@ s@@ sion of the European Parliament ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed .

re@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion of the se@@ s@@ sion
I dec@@ l@@ are re@@ su@@ m@@ ed the se@@ s@@ sion of the European Parliament ad@@ j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ed on T@@ h@@ ur@@ s@@ day , 1@@ 8 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 2001 .
A@@ n@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ em@@ ents by the President
ladies and gentlemen , on 2@@ 6 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , E@@ T@@ A c@@ la@@ im@@ ed another v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m in a b@@ om@@ b at@@ ta@@ c@@ k in S@@ an S@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ an , which c@@ o@@ s@@ t the life of R@@ a@@ m@@ on D@@ í@@ e@@ z G@@ ar@@ c@@ í@@ a , an ar@@ my co@@ o@@ k , and in@@ j@@ u@@ red two other people .
I should like to o@@ f@@ f@@ er the European Parliament &apos; s s@@ in@@ c@@ er@@ e con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the family of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m and to s@@ en@@ d our w@@ is@@ h@@ es for the pr@@ om@@ p@@ t rec@@ o@@ very of those in@@ j@@ u@@ red in this at@@ ta@@ c@@ k .
unfortunately , all we can do is to re@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ir@@ m our fe@@ el@@ ing of re@@ v@@ ul@@ sion and ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation of this in@@ dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ate v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
at the same time , let me welcome to the v@@ is@@ it@@ or@@ s &apos; g@@ al@@ l@@ er@@ y Mr L@@ u@@ is de G@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ es and Mr J@@ e@@ s@@ ú@@ s C@@ al@@ d@@ er@@ a , res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y the he@@ ad@@ s of the P@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r Party and the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t W@@ or@@ k@@ ers Party d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations of the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
they have come to present to the European institutions the agreement for freedom and against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by their political parties on 8 December 2000 , to which many trade uni@@ ons , em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ers &apos; as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations and B@@ as@@ qu@@ e peace as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations , a@@ m@@ on@@ g others , were si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
your st@@ ance is all the more c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ e@@ ous , gentlemen , since E@@ T@@ A rec@@ ently dec@@ la@@ red that all the present and future si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ ies to this agreement will be ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted by their actions .
p@@ le@@ a@@ se be as@@ su@@ red that you can c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on the European Parliament &apos; s s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity .
ladies and gentlemen , I in@@ v@@ ite you to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence .
( the House ro@@ se and ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence )
ladies and gentlemen , I have a st@@ a@@ te@@ ment to make .
the President of the Court of F@@ ir@@ st In@@ st@@ ance of the European C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities is@@ su@@ ed an order on 2@@ 6 J@@ an@@ u@@ ary in which he set a@@ si@@ de the decision of the European Parliament of 2@@ 3 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2000 rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ ing the French Government &apos; s no@@ ti@@ fication an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ing the en@@ ding of J@@ e@@ an @-@ M@@ ar@@ i@@ e L@@ e P@@ en &apos;s man@@ d@@ ate .
the order st@@ a@@ tes that Mr L@@ e P@@ en should re@@ j@@ o@@ in Parliament and , of course , it is my responsibility to apply this c@@ ou@@ r@@ t decision im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , I have as@@ k@@ ed the Committee on L@@ e@@ g@@ al Affairs and the In@@ ter@@ n@@ al M@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ t for an opinion on what action the European Parliament should take in respect of this matter .
I have already no@@ ti@@ c@@ ed one new el@@ ement : the President of the Court of F@@ ir@@ st In@@ st@@ ance has con@@ f@@ er@@ red upon the European Parliament dis@@ c@@ re@@ ti@@ on@@ ary p@@ o@@ w@@ ers in relation to a dec@@ re@@ e en@@ ding the man@@ d@@ ate of the European Parliament .
if this decision were to be con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ed , the L@@ e P@@ en case would be a further st@@ e@@ p to e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers of the European institutions over national governments
I w@@ ro@@ te to you y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , Madam President , because the l@@ ar@@ g@@ est d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c country in the world , In@@ di@@ a , is going through a particularly tra@@ g@@ i@@ c ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , and I think it would be appropriate for Parliament to s@@ how its in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of st@@ an@@ ding by the In@@ di@@ an authorities and people at this time , and I would ask you , with your ap@@ pro@@ va@@ l , to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence .
thank you , Mr D@@ u@@ pu@@ is .
I did of course s@@ en@@ d a m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge to this effect to the In@@ di@@ an authorities im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
thank you for your su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion , which , I believe , is the same as the su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion Mrs G@@ il@@ l w@@ is@@ h@@ ed to make . I will re@@ ad@@ il@@ y in@@ v@@ ite you to ob@@ s@@ er@@ ve a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence in h@@ on@@ our of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of this h@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ d@@ ous dis@@ a@@ st@@ er .
( the House ro@@ se and ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed a min@@ u@@ te &apos; s si@@ l@@ ence )
Madam President , thank you very much for that m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge of con@@ d@@ ol@@ ence , which is what I w@@ an@@ ted to t@@ al@@ k about concerning In@@ di@@ a .
Madam President , I r@@ ise concerning R@@ ul@@ es 7 ( 1 ) , 7 ( 2 ) and 8 ( 4 ) of our R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e to ask whether you or your services have received a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation from the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish Government in@@ for@@ m@@ ing you that the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party has as@@ k@@ ed to change one of three n@@ a@@ m@@ es on its l@@ is@@ t , which would re@@ mo@@ ve the n@@ a@@ me of s@@ om@@ e@@ one el@@ ec@@ ted in the E@@ a@@ st M@@ i@@ d@@ l@@ an@@ ds region in the European el@@ ec@@ tions last J@@ un@@ e .
the change would be to re@@ mo@@ ve the n@@ a@@ me of Mr W@@ il@@ li@@ a@@ m N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n and re@@ place it with Mr J@@ a@@ v@@ ed A@@ ra@@ in , the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th @-@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ed C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive , who is here with us today in the public g@@ al@@ l@@ er@@ y .
you will no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t know that the system of pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion was used for the first time in the U@@ K in the last European el@@ ec@@ tions and the people who voted in these el@@ ec@@ tions voted for a par@@ ty w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e v@@ i@@ e@@ ws they agreed with , not for an in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al .
perhaps if no com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation has been for@@ th@@ com@@ ing you could con@@ ta@@ c@@ t the B@@ r@@ it@@ ish Government to ask for their o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al , legal position .
finally , under R@@ u@@ le 7 ( 3 ) , I ask that the committee responsible , mentioned in this r@@ u@@ le , look into the c@@ re@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ als of Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n to see whether he has , in fact , pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the A@@ c@@ t of 20 S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 6 , as de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed in our R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e .
Madam President , R@@ u@@ le 2 of our R@@ ul@@ es of P@@ ro@@ c@@ ed@@ ur@@ e sa@@ y@@ s that we all si@@ t here as in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als , not as ag@@ ents of political parties and we do not take or@@ d@@ ers from ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e .
( ap@@ pla@@ use from the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e and le@@ f@@ t ) T@@ he e@@ s@@ s@@ ence of democracy is that in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als have gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed rights against the state .
the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ ti@@ v@@ es , I am s@@ or@@ r@@ y to say , are now w@@ is@@ h@@ ing to in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a new d@@ o@@ c@@ t@@ r@@ ine that political parties have power over in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als .
that is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of to@@ t@@ al@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an@@ is@@ m and that is why I le@@ f@@ t them .
( ap@@ pla@@ use from the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e and le@@ f@@ t )
Madam President , Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly cor@@ rec@@ t when he d@@ ra@@ ws attention to R@@ u@@ le 2 , but what he for@@ g@@ et@@ s is that the el@@ ec@@ tions in 1999 to@@ o@@ k place under pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ al re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tion .
no el@@ ec@@ to@@ r voted for Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n , or indeed for me or for Mr H@@ e@@ at@@ on @-@ H@@ ar@@ r@@ is .
they voted for a par@@ ty l@@ is@@ t and Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted h@@ im@@ s@@ el@@ f as fully in support of the C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party , its le@@ ad@@ er and its European policy .
he has now com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated that position and he is therefore d@@ en@@ ying the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c rights of the v@@ o@@ ters of the E@@ a@@ st M@@ i@@ d@@ l@@ an@@ ds , over 4@@ 0 % of w@@ h@@ o@@ m voted C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive .
I call on Mr N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on D@@ un@@ n to re@@ si@@ g@@ n .
although this B@@ r@@ it@@ ish debate is very di@@ ver@@ ting , Mr H@@ el@@ m@@ er , we do have an extremely important Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on economic and social cohesion .
Madam President , I shall be very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f , but I too wish to speak on the subject of P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al .
this was an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y and the most serious as@@ p@@ ec@@ t is the fact that si@@ x people were k@@ il@@ led .
in addition to these de@@ a@@ th@@ s , which we can do nothing about , it has unfortunately already been pre@@ d@@ ic@@ ted that there will be h@@ u@@ ge ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al d@@ a@@ ma@@ g@@ es and it will therefore be necessary to ob@@ ta@@ in the s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity of the European Union .
as Mrs F@@ i@@ gu@@ e@@ i@@ re@@ do st@@ a@@ ted , we hope this House will support us in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g .
Madam President , it is the case that , although the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al system is a l@@ is@@ t system , the n@@ a@@ m@@ es of those on the l@@ is@@ t ap@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r in the order in which el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ s are in@@ v@@ ited to vote for them .
therefore , it is the case that we are here as in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als as well as re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing a political position .
that is very important and it should be k@@ no@@ w@@ n that the United K@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ o@@ m C@@ on@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tive Party was a@@ m@@ on@@ g those parties that voted for the pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on that n@@ a@@ m@@ es should be on the b@@ al@@ l@@ o@@ t , not o@@ f@@ f the b@@ al@@ l@@ o@@ t .
I should like to draw your and Parliament &apos; s attention to a m@@ an @-@ made dis@@ a@@ st@@ er with which we shall be con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted in the course of the next few d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
last w@@ e@@ e@@ k , I and two of my c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , F@@ el@@ e@@ k@@ n@@ as U@@ c@@ a and K@@ on@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ in@@ o@@ s A@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ d@@ ra@@ k@@ is , were on a v@@ is@@ it to I@@ st@@ an@@ b@@ u@@ l where we m@@ e@@ t for@@ m@@ er pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers , their f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies and their la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , together with human rights c@@ a@@ m@@ pa@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ers in Turkey .
a large number of pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers in Turkish j@@ a@@ il@@ s are on h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e , with some of them pre@@ pa@@ red to di@@ e because of the Turkish Government &apos; s policy towards pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers .
I should like to call upon you , Madam President , to make con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with the Turkish authorities and p@@ res@@ s for a new dialogue to be em@@ b@@ ar@@ k@@ ed upon between the Turkish Government , on the one hand , and pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers &apos; organisations and the human rights organisations , on the other .
o@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise , we shall see a su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ sion of f@@ at@@ al@@ ities next w@@ e@@ e@@ k , for the h@@ un@@ g@@ er st@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e has been going on for m@@ on@@ th@@ s .
thank you , Mrs F@@ ra@@ h@@ m .
I have certainly taken no@@ te of your com@@ ment .
Madam President , for reasons of a to@@ p@@ ical nature , I am in a position to give this issue my w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ he@@ ar@@ ted support .
the day before y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day , I had the opportunity to speak to Turkey &apos; s Minister of J@@ u@@ st@@ ice , and I made h@@ i@@ m aware of the ur@@ g@@ ent nature of the situation .
I would therefore ask you to take action acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
Madam President , I wish to ad@@ d my v@@ o@@ ice to those of the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ers who raised the issue of the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y that to@@ o@@ k place in P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al last w@@ e@@ e@@ k@@ en@@ d .
in order to g@@ a@@ in some in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t into what ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed , we need only be@@ a@@ r the following in mind : last w@@ in@@ ter was the d@@ ri@@ est of the c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y and last December and J@@ an@@ u@@ ary were the w@@ et@@ te@@ st in li@@ v@@ ing m@@ em@@ or@@ y .
these f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s m@@ e@@ ant that all of the country &apos; s actions to control the f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ s f@@ a@@ il@@ ed .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing ha@@ p@@ pen@@ ed so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly that u@@ n@@ e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ted de@@ a@@ th@@ s and f@@ l@@ o@@ od@@ s o@@ c@@ c@@ ur@@ red as a result .
we therefore need to make a much greater e@@ f@@ for@@ t than might be con@@ si@@ de@@ red necessary , because the situation has been t@@ r@@ u@@ ly ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ al .
Madam President , I too would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s an opinion on the issue raised by Mrs F@@ ra@@ h@@ m .
I was a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation , as she ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly said , and like the re@@ st of the d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation , I too was h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly em@@ b@@ ar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of the par@@ ents of the political pr@@ is@@ on@@ ers because , although they did indeed be@@ g us to help their children , we were un@@ able to res@@ p@@ on@@ d .
I am sur@@ pr@@ ised that , despite re@@ p@@ e@@ ated ap@@ p@@ e@@ als , by both my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w Member Mr K@@ or@@ a@@ k@@ a@@ s and me , still no re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions have been made to the Turkish authorities .
I should like to ask you to make such re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as possible , before we start to m@@ ou@@ r@@ n even more v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s than we are m@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ ing already from the at@@ ta@@ c@@ k on the pr@@ is@@ ons by the Turkish authorities in December 2000 .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last few d@@ a@@ y@@ s , various par@@ ts of P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al , especially in the n@@ or@@ th and the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e of the country , have su@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red from ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ e@@ a@@ th@@ er conditions , with t@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ ti@@ al ra@@ in that has led to the l@@ o@@ s@@ s of human life , the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of h@@ om@@ es , f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies being dis@@ pla@@ c@@ ed , d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge to b@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ s , en@@ or@@ m@@ ous h@@ ar@@ m to farming , fisheries , industry and trade , the d@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion of com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation l@@ in@@ es and the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ur@@ e of h@@ ar@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s and por@@ ts .
not all of the d@@ a@@ ma@@ ge has , of course , been fully as@@ se@@ s@@ sed yet , but the to@@ ta@@ l c@@ o@@ s@@ t may re@@ ac@@ h b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of e@@ s@@ c@@ u@@ d@@ o@@ s . this will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e the mo@@ b@@ il@@ is@@ ation of Community special assistance g@@ r@@ an@@ ts in order to deal with the economic and social problems c@@ a@@ u@@ sed by this de@@ va@@ st@@ ation .
therefore , in addition to s@@ en@@ ding our he@@ ar@@ t@@ f@@ el@@ t con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of the v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s and ex@@ p@@ res@@ sing our s@@ y@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ y for the people who have l@@ o@@ s@@ t their h@@ om@@ es and their p@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ s@@ si@@ ons , in which , I am sure , all Members of this Parliament j@@ o@@ in , we ask you , Madam President to make re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions to the Commission , ur@@ g@@ ing it to provide , in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e Government and the local authorities , em@@ er@@ g@@ ency aid for the most b@@ ad@@ ly a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities so that economic ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity may be re@@ st@@ o@@ re@@ d .
I would also ask the C@@ on@@ f@@ er@@ ence of P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ents to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de this matter in the to@@ p@@ ical and ur@@ g@@ ent debate in Parliament &apos; s next part @-@ se@@ s@@ sion .
Madam President , as a B@@ as@@ qu@@ e M@@ E@@ P , I would like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion and con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation of the ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence of E@@ T@@ A .
I would also like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my con@@ d@@ ol@@ ences to the family of R@@ a@@ m@@ ó@@ n G@@ ar@@ c@@ í@@ a and to all the f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies of v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m@@ s of ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m and v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence .
on behalf of the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t Party , I would also like to say that our over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ m@@ ing priority is the e@@ th@@ ical pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of human rights and , above all , the right to life .
you have p@@ res@@ en@@ ted us with the an@@ t@@ i @-@ ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t agreement d@@ ra@@ f@@ ted by S@@ pa@@ in &apos; s P@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r Party and the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t W@@ or@@ k@@ ers Party .
I must te@@ l@@ l you that this agreement does not o@@ f@@ f@@ er an@@ y@@ th@@ ing new and that it con@@ ta@@ in@@ s only re@@ p@@ res@@ si@@ ve measures , p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e measures and im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
it does not o@@ f@@ f@@ er any v@@ al@@ i@@ d proposal to res@@ ol@@ ve the political conflict in the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y .
it is now t@@ en years since the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e par@@ li@@ a@@ ment ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed the right to s@@ el@@ f @-@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation but , n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish Government has d@@ el@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ a@@ te@@ ly i@@ g@@ no@@ red this free d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c decision adopted in the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y .
in the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y we need less f@@ as@@ c@@ is@@ m from E@@ T@@ A and less c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m and im@@ position from the state ; we need more dialogue , more democracy and more respect for the d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c decisions of the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e par@@ li@@ a@@ ment .
Madam President , two d@@ a@@ y@@ s ago , after the an@@ n@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ement concerning the par@@ d@@ ons for 1@@ 4 t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s and the m@@ ed@@ al a@@ w@@ ar@@ ded to the for@@ m@@ er he@@ a@@ d of the political p@@ ol@@ ic@@ e of S@@ an S@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ st@@ i@@ an , A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded and I qu@@ o@@ t@@ e : &quot; the a@@ w@@ ar@@ d of par@@ d@@ ons and h@@ on@@ ou@@ r@@ s for t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s s@@ en@@ ds out a clear m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge .
the v@@ i@@ ol@@ ation of human rights will not be e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y pu@@ n@@ is@@ h@@ ed in S@@ pa@@ in . &quot;
this is not the first time that par@@ d@@ ons or h@@ on@@ ou@@ r@@ s for t@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ re@@ r@@ s have been g@@ r@@ an@@ ted or a@@ w@@ ar@@ ded by the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish authorities .
in its J@@ un@@ e 1999 report , A@@ m@@ n@@ e@@ st@@ y In@@ ter@@ national st@@ a@@ ted its b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f that there is a c@@ li@@ ma@@ te of im@@ pu@@ n@@ ity in S@@ pa@@ in .
A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 6 of the Treaty of A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ d@@ am . . .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Madam President , re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to this d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment that he mentioned , Mr O@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ on@@ do t@@ al@@ ks to us about c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m .
I do not know if he is re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m of S@@ pa@@ in in relation to the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y .
I am sure he is not , because , as he k@@ no@@ ws , the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e region has the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est de@@ g@@ re@@ e of s@@ el@@ f @-@ government of any European region .
however , I would like to ask h@@ i@@ m whether that d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment also t@@ al@@ ks about the st@@ a@@ te@@ ments by the le@@ ad@@ er of his par@@ ty when he said to E@@ T@@ A : &quot; do not k@@ il@@ l the co@@ o@@ ks , k@@ il@@ l the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers that be &quot; .
by &quot; the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers that be &quot; he is re@@ f@@ er@@ r@@ ing to the P@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r Party . I am sure , Mr O@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ on@@ do , that in this respect &quot; the p@@ o@@ w@@ ers that be &quot; means the P@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r Party , and the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t Party , and that the whole of this Parliament em@@ b@@ o@@ di@@ es that power .
the whole of this Parliament is therefore in a position to consider itself a v@@ ic@@ ti@@ m of E@@ T@@ A .
Madam President , Parliament k@@ no@@ ws , because we have said it many ti@@ m@@ es and today we have ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed it to some of you , that in p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing and de@@ f@@ en@@ ding an agreement in favour of f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s and against ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m in the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y , we are de@@ f@@ en@@ ding and p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing an agreement which g@@ o@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d the m@@ e@@ re@@ ly political field , since it is an agreement in de@@ f@@ ence of f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s , in de@@ f@@ ence of life , in de@@ f@@ ence of p@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m .
there may be people who do not support this agreement ; there may be people who c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ ise it ; there has even been one organisation - the ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ t organisation E@@ T@@ A , of course - which has th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed to k@@ il@@ l the si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ ies , and those people who might si@@ g@@ n it la@@ ter , for de@@ f@@ en@@ ding it .
well , ladies and gentlemen , despite all of this , we will always continue to de@@ f@@ end f@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ s .
we will always continue to de@@ f@@ end the right of any c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en of the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e C@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y , whether they are in favour of a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y or of in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence , to be able to mo@@ ve ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d our country without e@@ s@@ cor@@ ts .
I want no more and no less than Mr G@@ or@@ o@@ st@@ i@@ ag@@ a does : I want to mo@@ ve ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d my country with my children , like they do , without having to take e@@ s@@ cor@@ ts .
Madam President , I wish to speak b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , following the la@@ te@@ st s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es by the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e N@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t Party and E@@ u@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ l H@@ er@@ r@@ it@@ ar@@ ro@@ k , to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s my s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and agreement with the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment you have made , Madam President , on behalf of the European Parliament , in de@@ f@@ ence of democracy and peace in S@@ pa@@ in .
our main problem in S@@ pa@@ in is ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , and f@@ as@@ c@@ is@@ t p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ ons such as those of E@@ u@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ l H@@ er@@ r@@ it@@ ar@@ ro@@ k are a th@@ re@@ at to peace in S@@ pa@@ in and in Europe .
the fact that there are internal problems in S@@ pa@@ in re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from the political di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between the c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l government and the B@@ as@@ qu@@ e par@@ li@@ a@@ ment does not pre@@ v@@ ent us here in the European Parliament from st@@ an@@ ding for peace and democracy and against f@@ as@@ c@@ is@@ m .
economic and social cohesion
the next it@@ e@@ m is the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation on economic and social cohesion .
I give the f@@ l@@ o@@ or to Commissioner B@@ ar@@ n@@ i@@ er .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , before com@@ ing to the main subject of my ad@@ d@@ res@@ s on behalf of the Commission this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , I should , with your per@@ mis@@ sion , like to ra@@ ise one point very b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly .
Madam President , I should like to res@@ p@@ on@@ d to the concerns ex@@ p@@ res@@ sed e@@ ar@@ li@@ er by Mrs F@@ i@@ gu@@ e@@ i@@ re@@ do , and by the S@@ ec@@ re@@ ta@@ r@@ y of State , Mrs T@@ or@@ res M@@ ar@@ qu@@ es and the Minister , Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a , following the very serious natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers which have st@@ r@@ ic@@ k@@ en the n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n region of P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al .
as I am the Commissioner responsible for de@@ al@@ ing with these issues , I wish to in@@ for@@ m them that we shall take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of every p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ bility of re@@ al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ating ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations , just as we have done in other c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es in the e@@ v@@ ent of natural dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers el@@ se@@ where in Europe , in order to st@@ and by the P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ gu@@ e@@ s@@ e authorities in meeting the ex@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ al costs of re@@ con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ tion , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s or indeed pre@@ v@@ en@@ ta@@ tive measures n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ it@@ ated by these dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this m@@ or@@ n@@ ing , the greater part of the discussion in the European Commission was taken up with ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ing the report , the S@@ ec@@ on@@ d R@@ e@@ por@@ t on E@@ con@@ om@@ ic and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al C@@ o@@ he@@ sion in the Union , which it was my h@@ on@@ our to present , with the agreement of my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers , Mrs D@@ i@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ to@@ p@@ ou@@ l@@ o@@ u and Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er .
I p@@ res@@ en@@ ted this report pu@@ r@@ su@@ ant to A@@ r@@ ti@@ c@@ le 1@@ 5@@ 9 of the Treaty , with which you are f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r , just as M@@ on@@ ic@@ a W@@ ul@@ f @-@ M@@ a@@ th@@ ies did in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 . it was as a result of this 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 report that the first information b@@ ec@@ a@@ me available , which was used in d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing up A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 .
a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of the report is available in three l@@ an@@ gu@@ ag@@ es at the en@@ t@@ r@@ ance to the C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er . the first part of the report which I am p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing g@@ i@@ v@@ es , for the first time , a s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of the European Union in terms of cohesion for the 2@@ 7 countries of the Union p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ enlargement .
the second part of the report an@@ al@@ y@@ ses the impact of other Community policies on the Union &apos; s objectives .
it as@@ se@@ s@@ ses the results ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed by the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds and the C@@ o@@ he@@ sion F@@ un@@ ds .
finally , in the s@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ e@@ si@@ s se@@ c@@ tion , the report ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ es a number of p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al a@@ v@@ en@@ u@@ es or re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations for the future . let me re@@ p@@ e@@ at , we have already made a su@@ m@@ mar@@ y available to each of you .
the com@@ p@@ le@@ te report , ladies and gentlemen , will be available as of this e@@ v@@ en@@ ing on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t , al@@ on@@ g with all the ap@@ pen@@ ded ma@@ p@@ s and st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ s per@@ ta@@ in@@ ing th@@ e@@ re@@ to .
there are two points I would like to make in my op@@ en@@ ing re@@ mar@@ ks , before l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ing to your v@@ i@@ e@@ ws . what are the issues at st@@ a@@ k@@ e in cohesion within the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union and how can we ad@@ d@@ res@@ s these issues ?
the first issue I shall ra@@ ise is that of a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al environment under@@ going ra@@ p@@ i@@ d and far @-@ re@@ ac@@ h@@ ing change , which a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts each of our countries and h@@ ence also the European Union as a whole : the issue of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and the context of new ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities based on in@@ te@@ l@@ li@@ g@@ ence and k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , the new ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , the information society , and the issue of d@@ em@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture .
this is com@@ p@@ ou@@ n@@ ded by the ever greater ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion on the part of our f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w citizens , as you are well aware , for our policies to be c@@ le@@ a@@ re@@ r , to in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve the citizens themselves , and for in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
the second issue is enlargement .
we f@@ ac@@ e the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of a European Union with 2@@ 7 or perhaps even 2@@ 8 members , and what b@@ ec@@ om@@ es clear from re@@ ad@@ ing this report c@@ a@@ re@@ fully is that this en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union will con@@ ta@@ in greater dis@@ par@@ ities , greater in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities , to an ex@@ t@@ ent un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted in pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous r@@ ou@@ n@@ ds of enlargement .
there are three key fi@@ gu@@ res you should be@@ a@@ r in mind in this respect : with the for@@ th@@ com@@ ing enlargement , the population of the European Union will increase by 3@@ 0 % , and the sur@@ f@@ ac@@ e area of the Union will increase by 3@@ 0 % , yet the Union &apos; s g@@ ro@@ s@@ s d@@ om@@ e@@ st@@ ic pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t will increase by only 5 % .
that is why in this report we i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied a third group of countries , which will in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries , which will com@@ pr@@ ise 1@@ 6 % of the population of the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union , where the per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come is ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly only 4@@ 0 % of the Community a@@ ver@@ age .
this is where the main ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge and the real change li@@ e .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , with enlargement , the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e of gra@@ v@@ ity of cohesion policy is going to sh@@ i@@ f@@ t e@@ a@@ st@@ w@@ ar@@ ds .
of the 1@@ 0@@ 5 million in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries , 9@@ 8 million will be li@@ v@@ ing in regions where the level of G@@ D@@ P per in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ ant is less than 7@@ 5 % of the a@@ ver@@ age in the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union .
yet , ladies and gentlemen , the en@@ t@@ r@@ y of extremely p@@ o@@ or E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n European countries into the European Union is not going to t@@ u@@ r@@ n the ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing p@@ o@@ or regions in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n , n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n and c@@ ent@@ ra@@ l Europe - I am th@@ in@@ king of the re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e and ou@@ ter@@ most regions too - all of a su@@ d@@ d@@ en into pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous and r@@ ic@@ h regions , as if by ma@@ g@@ i@@ c .
the regions currently co@@ v@@ e@@ red by O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 1 are still in di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty , even if there has been some progress .
there has been progress .
per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come in these regions has mo@@ v@@ ed c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ r to the Community a@@ ver@@ age .
it has in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d from 6@@ 3 % in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 to 6@@ 9 % in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 .
par@@ tly with the help of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds and the C@@ o@@ he@@ sion F@@ un@@ ds , the countries co@@ v@@ e@@ red by cohesion policy have ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th at a ra@@ te h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er than the Community a@@ ver@@ age .
yet , within an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing number of Member States , the t@@ en@@ d@@ ency is not towards the el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of dis@@ par@@ ities .
dis@@ par@@ ities continue to ex@@ is@@ t and are even being ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ated .
un@@ employment st@@ an@@ ds at more than 20 % in some regions , regions which have for a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able l@@ en@@ g@@ th of time been le@@ f@@ t out in terms of progress due to their re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ e nature and de@@ population , and the employment ra@@ te for women is 1@@ 9 per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge points b@@ el@@ o@@ w that of men .
these are the ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions you can re@@ a@@ d in the report , in which we d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ be the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities , the p@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ts of p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty , s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es ex@@ t@@ re@@ me p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty , in some ur@@ b@@ an d@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ ts and some rural areas .
how can we ad@@ d@@ res@@ s these issues ?
ladies and gentlemen , in our view , cohesion policy must continue to be the key el@@ ement in the European Union &apos; s s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ta@@ l mo@@ de@@ l .
we are part of a European Union which w@@ is@@ h@@ es to for@@ m@@ al@@ ise its st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity .
this means we have to ask three qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons of cohesion policy : why , for w@@ h@@ o@@ m and how ?
why ?
I s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es he@@ a@@ r it said that it is not possible to do e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing from B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s and that more su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity is n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
I am all in favour of greater su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity , but I am not and I shall n@@ e@@ v@@ er be in favour of al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing cohesion policy to become nothing more than the trans@@ f@@ er of funding .
it is not enough just to s@@ en@@ d c@@ he@@ qu@@ es .
we cannot accept any form of r@@ en@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ ation of cohesion policy for we still have s@@ ha@@ red priorities , g@@ en@@ u@@ ine Community priorities and it is in our s@@ ha@@ red interest to ensure the su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able and b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed development of a f@@ ra@@ me of re@@ f@@ er@@ ence for cohesion policy .
the debate is only just be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing .
I do not have any decisions to o@@ f@@ f@@ er you , just some th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts , perhaps .
one of these th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts is based on the ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence g@@ a@@ in@@ ed over more than t@@ en years of cohesion policy , and le@@ ad@@ s me to think that there are matters that are more c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al and more serious than others for the development of our ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies .
as I have mentioned already , there is the ur@@ b@@ an issue , n@@ et@@ working , or even the specific issues a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting areas that are h@@ an@@ d@@ ic@@ ap@@ p@@ ed in g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical terms ; by re@@ m@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s , m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in@@ ous to@@ p@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y or other natural h@@ an@@ d@@ ic@@ ap@@ s .
human resources , too , must be taken into account , since that a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts employment .
our report s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally la@@ y@@ s down some gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing more high quality j@@ o@@ b@@ s , im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed social in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion and e@@ qu@@ al opportunities .
finally , taking this debate into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission could be re@@ ad@@ y , when the time comes , to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e a more st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c and co@@ h@@ er@@ ent approach to EU ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al development to the other com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity institutions , so that our con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed objective of economic and social cohesion would be st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed by an in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al d@@ im@@ en@@ sion and ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al support .
for w@@ h@@ o@@ m do we implement cohesion policy ?
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed of two points in this respect , and these con@@ v@@ ic@@ tions are s@@ ha@@ red by the Commission as a whole .
the first is that we must continue to p@@ ri@@ or@@ it@@ ise support for the regions la@@ g@@ g@@ ing the f@@ ur@@ th@@ est be@@ h@@ in@@ d in development terms , for future Member States but also for current EU Member States .
the whole problem of priority support for the most under@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed regions , of course , ra@@ is@@ es the question of the level at which we shall have to set the el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ bility th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d for regions which are de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing too s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly .
my second con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion is that the regions la@@ g@@ g@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d in development are not the only on@@ es f@@ ac@@ ing problems to which we must find s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions . other regions within the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed Union are a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ted too .
if we are to have Community priorities then we must con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late measures that can be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted throughout the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y of the European Union for often , within a s@@ in@@ g@@ le state , there are regions that are r@@ ic@@ her than others and s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es even within a s@@ in@@ g@@ le region there are areas of ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion right next to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ly d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c areas - as is s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n in the ur@@ b@@ an a@@ u@@ d@@ it which I is@@ su@@ ed a few m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago .
ladies and gentlemen , I think it is in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly possible to d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ate implementation to the Member States , ap@@ pl@@ ying the principle of su@@ b@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ ity better than in the past , on con@@ d@@ ition that we are sure that Community priorities are being res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted and that European funding con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to go to those that have the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st need .
how are we to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out this cohesion policy ?
this can be su@@ m@@ m@@ ed up in two p@@ h@@ ra@@ ses , im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency and im@@ pro@@ v@@ ed management . I have p@@ res@@ en@@ ted my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations to the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , and I shall present my ex@@ pl@@ an@@ ations to the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y C@@ on@@ t@@ ro@@ l - but it must be a c@@ re@@ di@@ ble policy with a@@ m@@ b@@ ition , as I have just mentioned , and with su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent funding .
we did not , at this stage , wish to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments or b@@ u@@ d@@ get e@@ st@@ i@@ ma@@ tes .
it would be too e@@ ar@@ ly ; we would be pu@@ t@@ t@@ ing the c@@ ar@@ t before the h@@ or@@ se .
let us first dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s objectives , con@@ t@@ ent and European priorities .
only a@@ f@@ ter@@ w@@ ar@@ ds will we have to find the resources to support these priorities .
I see that fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e as a re@@ f@@ er@@ ence point .
it will be a key fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e in the discussion of financial matters that we shall have with you and the Member States when the time comes .
ladies and gentlemen , w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er the level of ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e in relation to the increase in dis@@ par@@ ities , I think it sa@@ f@@ e to say that any cohesion policy will be c@@ re@@ di@@ ble only in@@ s@@ o@@ far as it is su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate funding .
w@@ ha@@ te@@ v@@ er the level of st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e , the key th@@ ing is that the con@@ t@@ ent of other Community policies should also promote cohesion , as the Treaty re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ ds .
in terms of co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ation with other Community policies , there is still progress to be made , particularly in order to improve s@@ y@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y .
I am th@@ in@@ king here of the common agricultural policy .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention . before an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ing your qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons , I would like to st@@ res@@ s that this report does not o@@ f@@ f@@ er any f@@ ir@@ m or defin@@ it@@ i@@ ve gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es .
it does not put forward any decisions , it m@@ e@@ re@@ ly op@@ en@@ s the debate .
it is a to@@ o@@ l for information and as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment , a s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of the European Union which in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es 2@@ 7 Member States for the first time , and at the end we ask a few qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons and make a few re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations .
we shall be much more p@@ rec@@ ise in the third report in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 , which will be is@@ su@@ ed very sh@@ or@@ tly before the time when decisions are taken on the new agenda .
I m@@ e@@ re@@ ly consider that this debate on cohesion policy and this report te@@ st@@ i@@ fy to the fact that cohesion policy has been effective and u@@ se@@ ful , in acc@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the g@@ o@@ als of the Treaty .
in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d European un@@ ity , in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity between the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of Europe and respect for the di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies of Europe : this con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ es to be our objective .
this debate on cohesion for@@ m@@ s part of the b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er debate on the future of the European Union which was in@@ it@@ i@@ ated in Nice and in which we are going to take part .
you may c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on us in the next three years le@@ ad@@ ing up to the new in@@ ter@@ g@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l con@@ f@@ er@@ ence in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 in the matter of this b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er debate and of the specific debate on our con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of the European Union , the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of the level of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity between n@@ ations and ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies .
thank you , and may I as@@ sure you of the European Commission &apos; s respect for the v@@ al@@ u@@ ed role that Parliament will pla@@ y in these dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
Commissioner , as C@@ ha@@ ir@@ m@@ an of the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y , T@@ r@@ an@@ s@@ por@@ t and T@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , I have to say that the report on cohesion is indeed an excellent basis for discussion and I t@@ r@@ u@@ st that we shall be h@@ ol@@ ding this discussion in the Committee on R@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y very s@@ o@@ on and that it will be a very g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al discussion .
now , as a Member of the European Parliament , I have to say that it is clear from the report on cohesion that there has been a re@@ la@@ tive im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement in our efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union and that , as you ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly said , we have had more su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s with the economic in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s than we have with the social in@@ d@@ ic@@ at@@ or@@ s .
some countries , such as I@@ re@@ land , have taken greater ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the opportunities given to them than have other countries .
so the m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge which we should s@@ en@@ d out from the House today is that we need more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion on all si@@ d@@ es , especially on the part of the Member States and regions and , of course , we need in@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ v@@ es , such as the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce res@@ er@@ ve , so that we can use European ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers &apos; money more e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ently .
ob@@ v@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly , I agree that we need to start f@@ o@@ c@@ using on the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st regions and countries of the European Union right now and again after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
but we must not for@@ get one very important point : today &apos;s p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ r countries are not going to get r@@ ic@@ her pu@@ re@@ ly and simply because enlargement will ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ally re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the a@@ ver@@ age per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a G@@ D@@ P in the European Union .
that is something we must be@@ a@@ r in mind if we are to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d st@@ ra@@ ying into mis@@ gu@@ i@@ d@@ ed policies .
I therefore think that we need to con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ te resources , we need to make better use of resources , we need to call for better ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion both on the part of the Commission and of the Member States and regions ; however , that must not cause us to for@@ get one b@@ a@@ si@@ c fact : that more people will want a s@@ l@@ ice of the c@@ a@@ k@@ e after enlargement and as far as I am concerned , Commissioner , it is v@@ it@@ al that we increase the si@@ z@@ e of the c@@ a@@ k@@ e , that we increase the resources of the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
I should like to he@@ a@@ r your v@@ i@@ e@@ ws on this .
Mr H@@ at@@ z@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ k@@ is , I go al@@ on@@ g with your an@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s , of course .
I for@@ m@@ ed my own as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment in the same s@@ p@@ ir@@ it and on the same b@@ a@@ se@@ s as y@@ ou@@ r@@ s@@ el@@ f .
I should point out to the House that if the t@@ w@@ el@@ ve c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries were to actually j@@ o@@ in the European Union right now , then the mean G@@ D@@ P for the Community would d@@ ro@@ p by 1@@ 8 points .
this would a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally have the ma@@ th@@ e@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ al effect of ra@@ is@@ ing regions which continue to be in di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es above the mean in one f@@ el@@ l s@@ w@@ o@@ o@@ p .
it would not , therefore , be f@@ a@@ i@@ r .
we are going to have to find some s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion for these regions which would th@@ e@@ re@@ by be pla@@ c@@ ed a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally above the Community mean .
Mr H@@ at@@ z@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ k@@ is , you te@@ l@@ l me more money will be n@@ e@@ ed@@ ed .
at this stage , I can ex@@ p@@ res@@ s only a per@@ s@@ on@@ al opinion .
we have not yet re@@ ac@@ h@@ ed the point of dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the future F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
I have only given you a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation , and a per@@ s@@ on@@ al opinion at that .
I think that the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ e of 0@@ .@@ 4@@ 5 % of Community G@@ D@@ P , which will be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 in line with the B@@ er@@ l@@ in decisions , if we ad@@ d together the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds , the C@@ o@@ he@@ sion F@@ un@@ ds , pr@@ e @-@ acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations , S@@ A@@ P@@ A@@ R@@ D , P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E , I@@ S@@ P@@ A , as well as the ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations pla@@ c@@ ed in res@@ er@@ ve to support the first acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 , for example , will give a to@@ ta@@ l re@@ p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing 0@@ .@@ 4@@ 5 % of G@@ D@@ P . I see this as a re@@ f@@ er@@ ence point .
to el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate further , my f@@ r@@ an@@ k opinion is that if we take on bo@@ ar@@ d another t@@ w@@ el@@ ve countries in the state they are at present , then we shall not be able to con@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ t any c@@ re@@ di@@ ble policy at an@@ y@@ th@@ ing less than this per@@ c@@ en@@ ta@@ ge .
that is all I can say for the present .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open m@@ an@@ n@@ er in which he ch@@ o@@ s@@ e to present his report in pl@@ en@@ ary .
it is the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of a debate - an h@@ on@@ est debate - that we want to be involved in as par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ ri@@ ans .
the Commissioner and Mr H@@ at@@ z@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ k@@ is said that regional dis@@ par@@ ities will become t@@ w@@ ice as great .
the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge to achieve cohesion will be greater : we have an un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted ex@@ p@@ an@@ sion of the Union and we still have p@@ o@@ or regions .
there is a m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ million e@@ ur@@ o question which is , to use the words of a for@@ m@@ er French Commission President : &quot; have we g@@ o@@ t the means to ma@@ t@@ ch our a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons ? &quot;
that is not to say that the means have to be financial , but we must also look at other policies .
it is clear that there will be a c@@ a@@ p on b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions .
therefore I ask you , Commissioner B@@ ar@@ n@@ i@@ er and your c@@ ol@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es , to look at the opportunities o@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ red by other policies , in particular the real and t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the p@@ ri@@ va@@ te sector in re@@ g@@ en@@ er@@ ating our regions .
can you be sure , Commissioner , that an en@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ en@@ ed view will be taken , in particular by Mr M@@ on@@ t@@ i , the Commissioner responsible for com@@ p@@ et@@ ition , to ensure that we have p@@ ri@@ va@@ te sector in@@ no@@ va@@ tive ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es to re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing regional dis@@ par@@ ities ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s the Union ?
I can indeed con@@ f@@ ir@@ m the att@@ it@@ u@@ de of the Commission , which I , in particular , share , and our de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation to take part , not just here but also in the national par@@ li@@ a@@ ments , and in and with the regions , in as dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed a way as possible , in a major debate .
my whole te@@ am in the D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ ate @-@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al is going to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing the results of the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of this s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t and open the debate over the next two years , in an extremely trans@@ par@@ ent and open m@@ an@@ n@@ er .
the current an@@ n@@ u@@ al al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation is ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR th@@ ir@@ ty b@@ il@@ li@@ on .
once again , I have t@@ ol@@ d Mr H@@ at@@ z@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ k@@ is what I though of the l@@ o@@ w@@ er l@@ im@@ it be@@ y@@ on@@ d which we should not go if we wish this policy to have any c@@ re@@ di@@ bility .
I also think , like you , Mrs M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y , that this European policy must ac@@ t as a le@@ v@@ er , b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing other funding and other s@@ y@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es to be@@ a@@ r .
that is why I at@@ ta@@ ch great importance to par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p , the m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ is@@ ation of p@@ ri@@ va@@ te funds , and the in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion of the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k as our par@@ t@@ n@@ er .
I quite understand , mo@@ re@@ over , your concern for greater co@@ h@@ er@@ ence with the com@@ p@@ et@@ ition policy for which Commissioner M@@ on@@ t@@ i is responsible .
we have to find a way forward which re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ es com@@ pl@@ ying with the T@@ re@@ a@@ ti@@ es , especially in terms of the rules of com@@ p@@ et@@ ition , and regional policy .
quite simply , Mrs M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y , let me share my per@@ s@@ on@@ al con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion that we shall not achieve s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and cohesion in Europe simply by c@@ ou@@ n@@ ting on the la@@ ws of the market , on su@@ p@@ p@@ ly and d@@ em@@ and or on a si@@ m@@ p@@ le tax trans@@ f@@ er policy .
I do not believe that li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ m al@@ one can help the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st regions c@@ e@@ a@@ se to be the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st or that it can help re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the g@@ a@@ p between them and the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est regions .
that is why I shall fi@@ g@@ h@@ t to ensure that we continue to have public in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ tion in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like , on behalf of my group , to thank you w@@ ar@@ m@@ ly for your excellent report .
I am sure it will pro@@ v@@ o@@ k@@ e s@@ ol@@ i@@ d , but also con@@ t@@ ro@@ ver@@ si@@ al discussion , and so I would just like to take this opportunity to st@@ im@@ u@@ late debate a little with a two @-@ f@@ ol@@ d question . the current system will actually re@@ main in force until the year 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
given that we are n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating with the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries with the a@@ i@@ m of their acc@@ ed@@ ing in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 / 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 , how then , can we make it clear to them that , even if they j@@ o@@ in under the current conditions , they cannot re@@ ly on our being able to continue the system , in other words , how are we going to make them understand that ir@@ res@@ p@@ ec@@ tive of what they si@@ g@@ n up to now , they are going to have to ad@@ ap@@ t to an a@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ed cohesion policy ?
secondly , perhaps you could al@@ la@@ y a little the fe@@ ar@@ s which pre@@ va@@ i@@ l ac@@ ro@@ s@@ s a good many regions by ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing to us how is it going to be possible for the regions which may rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve less support after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 7 , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing we apply , not to l@@ o@@ s@@ e support and s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity at a moment &apos; s no@@ ti@@ ce ?
how can we make it possible for them - as has , in fact , been done h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to using the p@@ ha@@ sing out m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d - to achieve the u@@ p@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n gra@@ d@@ u@@ ally , without their being d@@ ro@@ p@@ p@@ ed from the system st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ta@@ way ?
you may be able to as@@ su@@ age quite a number of fe@@ ar@@ s with your an@@ s@@ w@@ er .
thank you for as@@ king this question , Mr J@@ ar@@ z@@ em@@ b@@ o@@ w@@ s@@ k@@ i . it is pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly the main question to be de@@ b@@ ated in terms of fin@@ ance .
let me s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , that the B@@ er@@ l@@ in F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive made pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on to set a@@ si@@ de some EUR 3@@ 9@@ .@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on for the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to j@@ o@@ in before 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 , to en@@ able them to be in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted into the current cohesion policy . after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 , however , they will of course be ent@@ it@@ led , like the current Member States , to par@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ate in a policy which will pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly be rather different .
my report ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed f@@ our possible ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es to c@@ a@@ ter for the regions which would a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally find themselves above the c@@ u@@ t @-@ o@@ f@@ f th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d as s@@ o@@ on as we in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ate a number of very p@@ o@@ or countries into the Union , and all I can do at this stage is ou@@ t@@ line these op@@ tions .
the first op@@ tion is to continue to apply the st@@ r@@ ic@@ t th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d of 7@@ 5 % of Community G@@ D@@ P which is the current th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d b@@ el@@ o@@ w which regions are el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble for O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 1 st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s , and therefore a greater con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion of ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations .
the second op@@ tion is to l@@ in@@ k this 7@@ 5 % th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d with a p@@ ha@@ sing @-@ out policy over a set per@@ i@@ o@@ d , su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t of money , in order to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the trans@@ ition for regions which , p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ enlargement , would su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly find themselves above that th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d .
a third op@@ tion is to ra@@ ise the th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ d above 7@@ 5 % to make more regions el@@ i@@ g@@ i@@ ble .
in that case , we should pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly have to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the issue of fin@@ ance .
the f@@ ou@@ r@@ th op@@ tion is to have two th@@ res@@ h@@ ol@@ ds , one for regions currently within the Union and one for the regions of countries j@@ o@@ in@@ ing the Union .
I am not in a position , n@@ or do I have any wish , to dec@@ i@@ d@@ e the matter right now .
I am here to l@@ is@@ t@@ en to your v@@ i@@ e@@ ws .
I shall be l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ing to the v@@ i@@ e@@ ws of the Member States , and the members of par@@ li@@ a@@ ment and el@@ ec@@ ted re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of these regions .
in the end , though , we shall have to op@@ t for one of these f@@ our al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ v@@ es .
Mr President , Commissioner , you said that in the future , the main f@@ o@@ c@@ us of cohesion will li@@ e in the E@@ a@@ st and that a cohesion policy of this kind will only be possible if there are su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent means available .
would you agree that we also need to allow su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent time for this , because we know from ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence that it ta@@ k@@ es time to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p regions ?
how can we re@@ ly on the Commission having the commitment to allow both time and money , in order to pr@@ e @-@ em@@ p@@ t the effects of the cohesion policy ?
EUR 4 b@@ il@@ li@@ on are available in C@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y V@@ I@@ I@@ I for the year 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 .
would it not make s@@ en@@ se to de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y this with a view to ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing cohesion in the E@@ a@@ st , even before enlargement ta@@ k@@ es place ?
where do you st@@ and on this ?
Mrs S@@ ch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , we do need time .
in the report I even mentioned the fact that for the countries which are currently in the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty within the European Union , the regions la@@ g@@ g@@ ing f@@ ur@@ th@@ est be@@ h@@ in@@ d in development , it would take another g@@ en@@ er@@ ation to re@@ d@@ u@@ ce this g@@ a@@ p .
I p@@ o@@ in@@ ted out that it would take r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly , and I can only make a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h pre@@ d@@ ic@@ tion , two g@@ en@@ er@@ ations for the countries s@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to j@@ o@@ in us in ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 4 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 .
I con@@ c@@ u@@ r with your view that we shall be able to make a greater su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s of enlargement and the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion of these countries if we make the best possible pre@@ par@@ ations at this stage .
that is why , al@@ on@@ g@@ si@@ d@@ e my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w C@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ers , Mr V@@ er@@ he@@ u@@ g@@ en and Mr F@@ is@@ ch@@ l@@ er , who are responsible , res@@ p@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y , for the P@@ H@@ A@@ R@@ E programme and the S@@ A@@ P@@ A@@ R@@ D programme , w@@ h@@ il@@ st I m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f am responsible for the I@@ S@@ P@@ A programme for the environment and transport , I am com@@ m@@ it@@ ted to en@@ sur@@ ing that this money is used pro@@ per@@ ly , and that part of the technical assistance as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with these funds is used to set up ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al f@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ wor@@ ks .
this is the real w@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ness of the c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e regional di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons have not ex@@ is@@ ted for very long .
the V@@ o@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ d@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s in P@@ ol@@ and have only been in ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence for two years .
we must therefore support the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al f@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ wor@@ ks by means of these S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds . indeed , I n@@ e@@ v@@ er mis@@ s an opportunity to ur@@ ge local com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities within the current Union to set up t@@ w@@ in@@ n@@ ing par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s and dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed cooperation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents with c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate country regions in order to establish more on@@ going cooperation on the human level within each ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
we at@@ ta@@ ch great importance , therefore , to using these pr@@ e @-@ acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion funds as u@@ se@@ fully as possible .
I cannot , however , make any com@@ m@@ it@@ ments , Mrs S@@ ch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ter , as to what we shall do with the money pla@@ c@@ ed in res@@ er@@ ve after 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 - I mentioned ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly EUR 4@@ 0 b@@ il@@ li@@ on - if these countries do not j@@ o@@ in in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 . for the time being the funds have been set a@@ si@@ de to c@@ a@@ ter for those acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons that do actually take place .
in res@@ p@@ on@@ se to your question , however , I should like to point out that we have pr@@ e @-@ acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments and that these are what we should be using , when the time comes , to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y acc@@ e@@ s@@ sion through su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ fully .
Commissioner , I agree that there can be no uni@@ on without economic and social cohesion , and that there can be no cohesion without means .
I also agree that the S@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l F@@ un@@ ds used have been effective and positive .
my specific question is therefore : is enlargement possible without an ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al e@@ f@@ for@@ t on the part of the European Union - from the moment of the first acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons - above and be@@ y@@ on@@ d this b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y res@@ er@@ ve ?
secondly , Commissioner , I must say that there is dis@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ t in certain European regions and some of your re@@ p@@ li@@ es do not provide any com@@ for@@ t , although it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that we are in a context of a very ra@@ p@@ i@@ d dialogue .
however , for this very reason I believe it is necessary to s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy something el@@ se .
you say that we have to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion for those regions which are currently rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing funds , especially the O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 1 regions .
I would like you to be more specific , Commissioner .
what is going to ha@@ p@@ p@@ en , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to your c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , to C@@ a@@ st@@ il@@ l@@ a @-@ L@@ a M@@ an@@ ch@@ a , E@@ st@@ re@@ ma@@ d@@ ur@@ a , A@@ n@@ d@@ al@@ u@@ si@@ a , G@@ al@@ ic@@ i@@ a , regions of P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , and &apos; L@@ ä@@ n@@ d@@ er &apos; which have just en@@ te@@ red O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 1 ?
let us be specific , because dis@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ t in those regions will only be pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted by c@@ l@@ ar@@ ity .
Mr I@@ z@@ qu@@ i@@ er@@ do C@@ ol@@ la@@ do , I do not have all the an@@ s@@ w@@ ers at this stage , and if I did , you would be j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied in c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ ing me .
we are only la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing the debate .
the b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s have been de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed ; the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions have been defin@@ ed .
all these EU regions have received gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es until 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
I have en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ red to te@@ l@@ l the t@@ r@@ u@@ th , because we cannot make s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es on enlargement and the en@@ l@@ ar@@ g@@ ed European Union , in@@ te@@ gra@@ ting the c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y re@@ la@@ ted p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe , without l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the fi@@ gu@@ res as they st@@ and .
this is a t@@ r@@ u@@ th@@ ful report .
yet I did not want to w@@ a@@ it until 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 before te@@ l@@ ling the t@@ r@@ u@@ th and as@@ king the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons which have to be as@@ k@@ ed of the Commission proposals , when the time comes , by the H@@ e@@ ad@@ s of State and Government and by Parliament .
so there is a problem , but there is no need to p@@ an@@ ic .
I should also like to say , in an@@ s@@ w@@ er to your specific question with regard to specific regions , E@@ x@@ t@@ re@@ ma@@ d@@ ur@@ a , s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n I@@ t@@ al@@ y or the L@@ ä@@ n@@ d@@ er of e@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n G@@ er@@ many , that it will de@@ pen@@ d on the level of in@@ come ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed by ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 5 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 .
what I do know , however , is that if we re@@ ta@@ in the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion of per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come - which I hope we do , since it is an objective c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion - then the a@@ ver@@ age Community G@@ D@@ P is going to d@@ ro@@ p as a result of enlargement .
the ra@@ te is going to d@@ ro@@ p to a greater or l@@ e@@ s@@ se@@ r ex@@ t@@ ent , Mr I@@ z@@ qu@@ i@@ er@@ do C@@ ol@@ la@@ do , acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to whether the t@@ w@@ el@@ ve c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries j@@ o@@ in at the same time or not .
once again , then , there is no need to p@@ an@@ ic .
the d@@ ro@@ p will perhaps not be as much as the 1@@ 8 points I mentioned e@@ ar@@ li@@ er .
the fact re@@ ma@@ in@@ s , however , that some regions currently co@@ v@@ e@@ red by O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 1 , which are currently en@@ j@@ o@@ ying a good level of development even though this is still b@@ el@@ o@@ w a@@ ver@@ age , are li@@ able to find that they are above a@@ ver@@ age following enlargement .
we are going to have to find a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion to this .
as I have said m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , these regions are not su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly going to become r@@ ic@@ h just because E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n European countries are j@@ o@@ in@@ ing the European Union .
we are going to have to find a su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion for these regions and continue to support them , and I have ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed a few possible ap@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ es .
one of these , for example , would be to have a to@@ ta@@ l b@@ u@@ d@@ get al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance , si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r to the system we set up for I@@ re@@ land and other regions , to co@@ v@@ er p@@ ha@@ sing out and a trans@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al per@@ i@@ o@@ d , particularly for those regions which were c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st to the a@@ ver@@ age .
even then , even with the new a@@ ver@@ age , there will still most pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly be , even l@@ o@@ o@@ king at the ma@@ p@@ s pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed in the report , which I ur@@ ge you to ex@@ a@@ m@@ ine c@@ a@@ re@@ fully , extremely p@@ o@@ or regions such as still ex@@ is@@ t in S@@ pa@@ in , P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , and even in I@@ t@@ al@@ y , within the European Union of today .
a s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , a l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y financial s@@ ol@@ u@@ tion , will have to be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d for the b@@ and of in@@ ter@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ ate regions , and what I am se@@ e@@ king to do is to ask the qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons to ob@@ ta@@ in the help I need in order to find appropriate s@@ ol@@ u@@ tions when the time comes .
Mr President , this debate is our opportunity for a pro@@ per discussion on the issues f@@ ac@@ ing us .
my question is quite si@@ m@@ p@@ le .
it is clear that enlargement will not just mean problems for the st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling regions which we are at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ting to em@@ b@@ ra@@ ce in the Union . at the same time , if in this case the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market wor@@ ks , other regions will also re@@ a@@ p the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it .
now , in all h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y , I am a little concerned about this re@@ as@@ on@@ ing on a@@ ver@@ ag@@ es , for it may be that the problem of in@@ come d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion will h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t regions which we could in@@ d@@ u@@ ce - although I do not know how - to con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te a little more to the over@@ all fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing of the system in view of the enlargement process .
I therefore feel that it could well be appropriate to set rather more re@@ fin@@ ed b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ ks for the cohesion policy and I continue to call for the implementation of the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t to en@@ large Europe to provide us with less ri@@ g@@ i@@ d objectives and establish a more f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble sc@@ al@@ e , rather than n@@ ec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y t@@ y@@ ing us to this idea of a to@@ t@@ ally a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c process , which s@@ en@@ ds the regions f@@ l@@ ying from c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y to c@@ a@@ te@@ g@@ or@@ y .
Mr C@@ o@@ st@@ a , as I said e@@ ar@@ li@@ er quite for@@ c@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly - you will for@@ give me re@@ p@@ e@@ ating it - I w@@ an@@ ted to in@@ it@@ i@@ ate this debate im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly , e@@ ar@@ ly enough to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the essential issues and our v@@ is@@ i@@ on of Europe , which is not just a su@@ per@@ market but a com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity .
I want us to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and to re@@ ac@@ h agreement on our political objectives .
th@@ e@@ re@@ after , once we have agreed on the objectives and priorities and the line of approach , we must give ourselves the resources to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y them forward .
so , dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sing the money involved at this stage would be a p@@ o@@ or way of op@@ en@@ ing the discussion .
I know per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly well that we shall have to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s fin@@ ance when the time comes .
that is my first point .
my second point is s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity .
we must continue to promote s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity between States .
you are well aware that there are States that are n@@ e@@ t con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ t@@ or@@ s and others that are not .
I therefore feel that this form of re@@ d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion is quite f@@ a@@ i@@ r and quite e@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , I must thank you for st@@ ating in your in@@ it@@ i@@ al s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h that enlargement en@@ ta@@ il@@ s problems and r@@ is@@ ks but also pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es opportunities . this is also my view .
if you look at de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments over the last t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years , with S@@ pa@@ in , P@@ or@@ t@@ u@@ g@@ al and G@@ re@@ ec@@ e , my own per@@ s@@ on@@ al con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion - and I n@@ e@@ v@@ er mis@@ s the opportunity to say so in the public de@@ b@@ a@@ tes I take part in - is that in the m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m and long term , any enlargement process ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te@@ ly con@@ ta@@ in@@ s more opportunities than r@@ is@@ ks and problems .
quite a@@ part from m@@ or@@ al@@ ity and p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s , it is just not in our interests to allow people li@@ v@@ ing on our d@@ o@@ or@@ st@@ e@@ p to continue to li@@ ve in p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty , of the kind we have right next d@@ o@@ or to us , as in the countries of E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe or A@@ l@@ b@@ an@@ i@@ a or the B@@ al@@ k@@ an st@@ a@@ tes , always le@@ ad@@ s to the same ou@@ t@@ come .
when people do not have enough to e@@ at , they em@@ i@@ gra@@ te .
people li@@ v@@ ing in p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty are pre@@ y to all s@@ or@@ ts of n@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ t con@@ f@@ l@@ ic@@ ts , war , tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king , and ma@@ f@@ i@@ a ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ it@@ ation .
it is therefore in our own interest , quite a@@ part from m@@ or@@ al or political concerns , to under@@ take this enlargement and to pa@@ y the pr@@ ice for sh@@ ar@@ ing progress .
I must also thank you for g@@ i@@ v@@ ing me this opportunity to say that this debate must also pro@@ ve that in the great ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of enlargement there are more opportunities than r@@ is@@ ks .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have not yet had the opportunity to re@@ a@@ d the report , but the first report on cohesion clearly s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ ed that the common agricultural policy was not con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ting to cohesion in the European Union .
the A@@ g@@ en@@ d@@ a 2000 reform was l@@ im@@ ited to ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing the st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s qu@@ o in the C@@ A@@ P .
I now wish to ask the Commissioner whether he can te@@ l@@ l us an@@ y@@ th@@ ing about the report &apos; s con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons on the C@@ A@@ P .
Mr President , what I have to say to the Commissioner is far si@@ m@@ pl@@ er .
very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , then , I would like to su@@ g@@ g@@ est that other c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a are used for the al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ation of funds than just the ra@@ te of G@@ D@@ P and of un@@ employment .
su@@ re@@ ly other f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s such as population con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ tion and d@@ is@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tion , p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al or lack of p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al in terms of new te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es and re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch , and g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ bility should be taken into account ?
and finally , my last question : su@@ re@@ ly the current situation for@@ c@@ es us to con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ late re@@ defin@@ ing the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive before 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 ?
Commissioner , at the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing of your s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h you in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated that the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es f@@ ac@@ ing us are g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation and enlargement .
together with other M@@ E@@ P@@ s , I have just att@@ en@@ ded the W@@ or@@ l@@ d S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al F@@ or@@ u@@ m in P@@ or@@ to A@@ le@@ g@@ r@@ e , where it was clearly s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ n that with the problem of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation we are en@@ ter@@ ing a new er@@ a , in which the European Union must pla@@ y a f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l role in the world .
this problem of world social b@@ al@@ ance must form part of our economic policy and , since you re@@ f@@ er@@ red to it , I would like to ask you what the European Union is going to do in this respect , because this is clearly going to have an in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence on our internal economic problems and also on our b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ ta@@ r@@ y problems .
secondly , Commissioner , I would like to ask you : to what ex@@ t@@ ent do you consider it f@@ a@@ i@@ r that States , such as S@@ pa@@ in , which still rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve cohesion funds , are con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ing z@@ er@@ o de@@ f@@ ic@@ it as an economic policy , at the r@@ is@@ k of .@@ .@@ .
( the President c@@ u@@ t the s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ er o@@ f@@ f )
Mr President , thank you very much Commissioner , you mentioned that we will also re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e new rules for enlargement , and pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly more money too .
I would like to ask a c@@ ou@@ p@@ le of qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons on the subject of new rules and , as such , on the subject of new i@@ d@@ e@@ as .
would it really be fe@@ a@@ si@@ ble , indeed would it also be w@@ ise in the future , to l@@ ar@@ g@@ el@@ y ta@@ r@@ get the support at one particular area , time and time again ?
would it not make more s@@ en@@ se to place more em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s than we have done h@@ i@@ th@@ er@@ to on particular pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t i@@ d@@ e@@ as , or el@@ se on particularly n@@ e@@ ed@@ y areas ?
this would also allow us to s@@ pen@@ d the money in a more ta@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ted way .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to be able to say that I am g@@ la@@ d to he@@ a@@ r this .
I have not yet had the opportunity to re@@ a@@ d the report , but I l@@ i@@ k@@ ed what you had to say about it .
I would like to ask you whether the Commission is pre@@ pa@@ red to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t to see the Community b@@ u@@ d@@ get increase from the current 1@@ .@@ 0@@ 4 % , to 1@@ .@@ 2@@ 7 % , as has been ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed ?
I ask this because if we have the b@@ u@@ d@@ get that has been ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed , then we will have money .
my second question is : what will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en to the ou@@ ter@@ most regions ?
you have not said an@@ y@@ th@@ ing about these regions and they are of concern to me .
Mr President , I want to thank the Commissioner for using the wor@@ d s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity in con@@ n@@ ec@@ tion with this report .
this is , of course , p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y what cohesion policy and regional policy are about .
I also want just b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly to ask whether the future debate will also co@@ v@@ er all other policy areas in the European Union which are important for regional g@@ ro@@ w@@ th - education , re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and social policy - so that it is possible to make use of everyone &apos; s ability to get involved and con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to regional g@@ ro@@ w@@ th .
Mr President , I am the one who should ap@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ise for having g@@ one on too long , most of all to those Members of Parliament who were un@@ able to ask their qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
I shall , however , re@@ main at your s@@ er@@ v@@ ice , as you know , in the w@@ e@@ e@@ ks and m@@ on@@ th@@ s to come in order to continue this discussion .
Mr C@@ un@@ h@@ a , if you re@@ a@@ d the report , you will see that we actually say that the C@@ A@@ P , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e objectives are production , ex@@ por@@ t c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity and su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , has not actually become involved in the way we might have h@@ op@@ ed in this ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ i@@ al cohesion policy , particularly because , in the regions l@@ i@@ k@@ el@@ y to b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from cohesion policy , f@@ ar@@ m si@@ z@@ es are that much more m@@ od@@ est .
I have , therefore , m@@ y@@ s@@ el@@ f , st@@ res@@ sed the fact that we should , as I said e@@ ar@@ li@@ er , improve s@@ y@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y through the common agricultural policy .
one of the means to do so would perhaps be , in future , to bo@@ o@@ s@@ t the em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ s on the rural development ar@@ m of the C@@ A@@ P , which was st@@ ar@@ ted in B@@ er@@ l@@ in .
Mrs D@@ ar@@ ra@@ s , I do not believe that we shall need to r@@ en@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ate the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive in the matter of cohesion policy .
the pl@@ ans made in B@@ er@@ l@@ in se@@ e@@ m to me per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate .
in an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ tion , we even made pro@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on for 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 , and now it is quite clear that no new countries will j@@ o@@ in in either 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2 or 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 3 . su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent su@@ m@@ s were set a@@ si@@ de to c@@ op@@ e with these acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ons , and so I do not think we shall need a new F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
you m@@ en@@ tion ch@@ an@@ g@@ ing the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ i@@ a , if necessary .
we might continue to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities , Mrs D@@ ar@@ ra@@ s , but I should like to point out that we are not too far o@@ f@@ f the real situation when we work on the basis of the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of li@@ v@@ ing , of per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a G@@ D@@ P , because it can be ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ed that where there is the l@@ o@@ w@@ est st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of li@@ v@@ ing there is also the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est ra@@ te of un@@ employment , the wor@@ st environmental conditions , and the l@@ o@@ w@@ est levels of In@@ ter@@ n@@ e@@ t access .
th@@ us , in some way , taking a s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of the per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of li@@ v@@ ing , we have pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed an acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te s@@ n@@ ap@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ t of the real state of the regions - and indeed it is no m@@ er@@ e acc@@ i@@ d@@ ent that my pre@@ dec@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or , Mrs W@@ ul@@ f @-@ M@@ a@@ th@@ ies , and all the other Members of Parliament who have given some th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to these qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons all agreed on this c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion .
now , you know we can com@@ b@@ ine this c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion with other aspects , especially un@@ employment , but I would like us to re@@ ta@@ in this c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ion as I think it an objective one .
Mr N@@ o@@ gu@@ e@@ ir@@ a , I do not have su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent time to take part in a debate on g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
I even , as you i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied e@@ ar@@ li@@ er , mentioned the new context of cohesion policy as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ated with g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation , which con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes the r@@ is@@ k which J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ el@@ or@@ s and others clearly i@@ d@@ en@@ ti@@ fied fi@@ f@@ te@@ en years ago , and which im@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed them to pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e this cohesion policy .
in the same s@@ in@@ g@@ le market , there is a r@@ is@@ k that w@@ e@@ al@@ th , trade and people will continue to be con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted in the same l@@ o@@ c@@ ations and that the p@@ o@@ o@@ re@@ st regions are im@@ p@@ o@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ed and mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ is@@ ed further .
that r@@ is@@ k in the s@@ in@@ g@@ le market is ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ated in a Europe li@@ v@@ ing in an age of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation .
that is why I think we do indeed need a cohesion policy and support for cohesion in future .
Mr R@@ ac@@ k , y@@ es , I am w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to look into new m@@ e@@ th@@ od@@ s with you , particularly as far as development of the new O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 2 policy is concerned .
I w@@ on@@ d@@ er , for example , about the s@@ en@@ se and u@@ se@@ f@@ ul@@ ness of the B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ el@@ s @-@ d@@ ri@@ v@@ en z@@ on@@ ing for O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 2 , in which I am re@@ qu@@ i@@ red to o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ally s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ fy , in agreement with the Member States , whether every in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al d@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ ic@@ t , com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity or v@@ il@@ la@@ ge is or is not to rec@@ e@@ i@@ ve O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 2 st@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ s .
I do not think that all this b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y is particularly u@@ se@@ ful , and that is why O@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ tive 2 policy , concerning regions other than the most under@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed , could be si@@ m@@ pl@@ er and more dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed , with in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments su@@ b@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated to Community policies or to regional development , the ur@@ b@@ an areas , m@@ ou@@ n@@ ta@@ in@@ ous regions , is@@ land regions , b@@ order regions or c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ sector objectives such as social cohesion and the fi@@ g@@ h@@ t against p@@ o@@ ver@@ ty .
I am per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to look into de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments which are dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed in terms of their ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion within the Member States and which do not con@@ v@@ e@@ y the im@@ p@@ res@@ sion of ex@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ c@@ y that the people of Europe s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es have .
Mrs T@@ or@@ res M@@ ar@@ qu@@ es , I cannot go any further than I already have on the subject of the F@@ in@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ al P@@ er@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive .
I have not for@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ en the ou@@ ter@@ most regions ; I even mentioned them in my op@@ en@@ ing re@@ mar@@ ks .
there is a specific par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h on these regions .
as Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed , I do a great deal of work for these se@@ v@@ en ou@@ ter@@ most regions .
Mrs H@@ ed@@ k@@ v@@ is@@ t @-@ P@@ e@@ ter@@ s@@ en , thank you for p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing out the importance of the term &apos; s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity &apos; . I also consider it important .
the t@@ it@@ le that we w@@ an@@ ted to give this report , ladies and gentlemen , is &quot; European U@@ n@@ ity , s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity between n@@ ations , regional di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity &quot; , and , as you will see when you re@@ a@@ d it in de@@ ta@@ i@@ l , I was c@@ a@@ re@@ ful to st@@ res@@ s - since this was a concern of min@@ e - the need to co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ate Community policies with regional development and cohesion , particularly in terms of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch or the social agenda while no@@ ting that Member States and national governments will , of course , re@@ ta@@ in their j@@ ur@@ is@@ d@@ ic@@ tion on social policy .
I am working within the sc@@ op@@ e of the Community &apos; s current j@@ ur@@ is@@ d@@ ic@@ tion .
thank you , Commissioner .
that con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es this it@@ e@@ m .

Mr President , I would like to thank those Members who , through m@@ e@@ et@@ in@@ g@@ s , discussion and dialogue , have con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ ted to what we consider to be a st@@ e@@ p forward in Europe &apos;s strategy for the Mediterranean : the Mediterranean as a g@@ a@@ te@@ way not just to the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st but also to the A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ ti@@ c , a cultural as well as economic area , con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ating the S@@ ou@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th dialogue but also the North @-@ S@@ ou@@ th and E@@ a@@ st @-@ S@@ ou@@ th di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ es at a time when im@@ pen@@ ding enlargement c@@ al@@ l@@ s us all to as@@ su@@ me specific res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
development must respect human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and the protection of the environment and health .
economic development must not dis@@ regard human rights or m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al respect for di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences .
we all re@@ al@@ ise that Europe needs a new p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y that in order to be effective , common st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es must be re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c and p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ able .
therefore , we must set ourselves clear , ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ va@@ ble ta@@ r@@ g@@ et@@ s so that , st@@ e@@ p by st@@ e@@ p , progress can be made towards development , security and st@@ ability .
on the one hand , a p@@ o@@ e@@ t would say : &quot; W@@ o@@ e be@@ ti@@ de the m@@ an who does not d@@ are to d@@ re@@ am great d@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ s ! &quot; but a st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ an would re@@ p@@ ly : &quot; W@@ o@@ e be@@ ti@@ de the p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ i@@ an who g@@ et@@ s carried a@@ way on em@@ p@@ ty d@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ s and does not see or res@@ ol@@ ve the problems which are st@@ ar@@ ing h@@ i@@ m in the f@@ ac@@ e ! &quot;
we have at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ ted to make our h@@ op@@ es p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al and re@@ al@@ is@@ able in the sh@@ or@@ t and m@@ ed@@ i@@ u@@ m terms .
in other words , we have put forward proposals which will give all the countries of the Mediterranean the same di@@ g@@ n@@ ity and the same opportunity for development in a new m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i @-@ f@@ ac@@ e@@ ted re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with an in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly large and more com@@ p@@ le@@ x Europe , a re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p that will have to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t for its international c@@ re@@ di@@ bility in the t@@ ou@@ g@@ h com@@ p@@ et@@ ition with the whole of the re@@ st of the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ed world .
it cannot be d@@ en@@ i@@ ed that , although the su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ve S@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ its were a m@@ il@@ e@@ st@@ one in that they p@@ in@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted a large number of problems , they did not do an@@ y@@ th@@ ing to res@@ ol@@ ve them .
indeed , I re@@ g@@ re@@ t to say that the governments have not im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted the proposals adopted at B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a : democracy , the r@@ u@@ le of law , transparency , social rights and an internal policy to pre@@ v@@ ent com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ities being for@@ c@@ ed to le@@ a@@ ve their countries .
a new policy of t@@ r@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l trade , sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ ding t@@ y@@ p@@ ical pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tions , including European pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tions , con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ing and pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing c@@ ou@@ n@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing and f@@ ra@@ u@@ d , food and environmental safety , the development of c@@ ra@@ f@@ t products and the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of programmes to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ fication and f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the con@@ ver@@ sion of non @-@ d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter into d@@ r@@ in@@ king w@@ a@@ ter and the development of t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m are some of the many points which we have dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed .
at this point , I would like to thank the o@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ als of the committee and of the political groups for their work , which was particularly d@@ em@@ an@@ ding because of the need to m@@ e@@ e@@ t the e@@ ar@@ li@@ er de@@ ad@@ l@@ in@@ es .
the time is now ri@@ p@@ e to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ able projects , and p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ able projects are those which do not or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ ate from specific pre@@ con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions or con@@ c@@ e@@ al@@ ed mo@@ ti@@ v@@ es but from a policy &apos;s ability to mar@@ r@@ y the needs of the citizens with economic and social concerns .
this is why Europe as a whole , not just Mediterranean Europe , to which , as an I@@ t@@ al@@ i@@ an , I have the h@@ on@@ our to b@@ el@@ on@@ g , must now rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise its strategy on the E@@ a@@ st and on the S@@ ou@@ th and its commitment to these regions as ab@@ s@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly essential , and con@@ f@@ ir@@ m that if he@@ al@@ th@@ y , la@@ st@@ ing progress is to be ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , the re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments of the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y must go hand in hand with human di@@ g@@ n@@ ity .
this te@@ x@@ t was not w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en in order to be pu@@ b@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed as a m@@ er@@ e dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation of in@@ t@@ ent : it was w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en to be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted , and for this we place our con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence and our t@@ r@@ u@@ st in the Commission and the Council , so that their cooperation with the European Parliament b@@ ec@@ om@@ es p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ able and u@@ p@@ d@@ a@@ te@@ able .
Mr President , last N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er , the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , Human Rights , C@@ om@@ m@@ on S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and D@@ e@@ f@@ ence P@@ ol@@ ic@@ y ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ ted me as rapporteur on the Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation ent@@ it@@ led &apos; R@@ e@@ in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ating the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s &apos; .
this Commission com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation s@@ er@@ v@@ es a d@@ u@@ al pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e : to as@@ se@@ s@@ s the ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ents of the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s and to put forward re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations in pre@@ par@@ ation for the min@@ is@@ te@@ ri@@ al con@@ f@@ er@@ ence to be held in M@@ ar@@ se@@ il@@ l@@ es in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 2000 .
before pro@@ c@@ e@@ ed@@ ing to dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ s the ac@@ t@@ u@@ al su@@ b@@ st@@ ance of the issue , let me first thank my f@@ el@@ l@@ o@@ w members of the Committee on F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , with w@@ h@@ o@@ m I had many dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons that were extremely h@@ el@@ p@@ ful for the fin@@ al d@@ ra@@ f@@ t of my report .
I should also like to say that I f@@ ra@@ m@@ ed this report taking into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation what has already been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed in Parliament , and Parliament &apos; s regard for the Mediterranean question , and at this point I would like to pa@@ y special t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the work carried out by Mr Y@@ an@@ n@@ is S@@ a@@ k@@ el@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ o@@ u .
in its te@@ x@@ t , the Commission once again se@@ ts out the three main g@@ o@@ als of EU @-@ Mediterranean policy , n@@ a@@ m@@ el@@ y : the c@@ re@@ ation of an area of peace and st@@ ability , the c@@ re@@ ation of an area of s@@ ha@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity through the pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of free trade and , finally , the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al under@@ st@@ an@@ ding a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of the region and the development of an ac@@ tive civil society .
Mr President , of these three g@@ o@@ als , only the e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a free @-@ trade area can be de@@ em@@ ed to have actually g@@ o@@ t o@@ f@@ f the g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d .
so I was p@@ le@@ a@@ se@@ d to he@@ a@@ r Commissioner B@@ ar@@ n@@ i@@ er com@@ ment in this v@@ e@@ in e@@ ar@@ li@@ er , since in the m@@ i@@ d@@ st of prof@@ ou@@ n@@ d in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ ities , li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation al@@ one cannot bring about economic development n@@ or the in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of de@@ e@@ p@@ ly di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ti@@ es .
this is , f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , a free @-@ trade area on European terms , as may be il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ ted by a s@@ in@@ g@@ le st@@ at@@ is@@ ti@@ c : to@@ ta@@ l trans@@ f@@ ers from the EU b@@ u@@ d@@ get to the Mediterranean countries a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to EUR 1 b@@ il@@ li@@ on per year , w@@ h@@ il@@ st those re@@ su@@ l@@ ting from the Mediterranean countries &apos; trade de@@ f@@ ic@@ it with the EU a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ t to EUR 3@@ 4 million per year .
in other words , the Union &apos; s financial contribution to the Mediterranean countries re@@ p@@ res@@ ents less than one @-@ th@@ ir@@ ti@@ et@@ h of the ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ es which Europe d@@ er@@ i@@ v@@ es from the free @-@ trade area .
as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds the c@@ re@@ ation of an area of peace and st@@ ability , the European Union does not c@@ ar@@ r@@ y much political c@@ l@@ out , despite the fact that in the countries of the S@@ ou@@ th there is a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine d@@ em@@ and for Europe .
there are many areas of conflict , which are li@@ able to j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ e the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
as to the development of an ac@@ tive civil society , it may be said that the people who actually b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it from the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programmes are ma@@ in@@ ly those who had pre@@ v@@ i@@ ous con@@ ta@@ c@@ t with Europe or who have c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e l@@ in@@ ks with governments .
civil society has d@@ em@@ on@@ st@@ ra@@ ted a clear lack of interest .
finally , the programmes for dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed cooperation , which are su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to en@@ able re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es of civil society from both si@@ d@@ es of the Mediterranean to m@@ e@@ e@@ t for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ e of de@@ v@@ is@@ ing j@@ o@@ in@@ t projects , have been f@@ ro@@ z@@ en since 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 .
the de@@ g@@ re@@ e of su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s is rather m@@ od@@ est , then , and the de@@ g@@ re@@ e of f@@ r@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ tion rather high . many sa@@ w the M@@ ar@@ se@@ il@@ l@@ es con@@ f@@ er@@ ence as a par@@ ti@@ al f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e .
in my view , the g@@ r@@ and v@@ is@@ i@@ on of the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean P@@ ar@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p which was in@@ a@@ u@@ gu@@ ra@@ ted in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a in N@@ o@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 has now given way to a n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ating process which la@@ c@@ ks any g@@ en@@ u@@ ine political will .
in my report , I at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t to present a number of proposals in@@ t@@ en@@ ded to over@@ come this situation .
I shall now in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce the si@@ x major areas to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on .
firstly , I think that the free @-@ trade area must be set in the context of a pro@@ per st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c approach .
together with our Mediterranean par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , we must la@@ y the f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations of an as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ate common market , c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of in@@ te@@ ra@@ c@@ ting sa@@ t@@ is@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ il@@ y with Europe &apos; s ec@@ on@@ om@@ y , taking local par@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ ters of development in the S@@ ou@@ th into con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation .
we should ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ate con@@ ver@@ ting the pl@@ an@@ n@@ ed free @-@ trade area into a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine &apos; common market &apos; en@@ com@@ pa@@ s@@ s@@ ing g@@ o@@ od@@ s of all k@@ in@@ ds .
secondly , m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion must be pla@@ c@@ ed at the very he@@ ar@@ t of development today .
there will be no real par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p between the two si@@ d@@ es of the Mediterranean until the or@@ g@@ an@@ ised movement of people is put on the agenda .
this is why I feel that , in com@@ ing years , m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion is going to re@@ p@@ res@@ ent a c@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ i@@ al as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of our relations with these countries .
we need j@@ o@@ in@@ t management of m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion f@@ l@@ o@@ ws , including measures to com@@ b@@ at il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and the ma@@ fi@@ as which prof@@ it from it .
we also need to la@@ y down policies on te@@ m@@ por@@ ary m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion , si@@ m@@ il@@ a@@ r to what the In@@ ter@@ national L@@ ab@@ our O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation is currently pro@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing , without ent@@ it@@ l@@ ement to per@@ man@@ ent re@@ si@@ d@@ ence .
I also feel that we should in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a special tra@@ v@@ e@@ l visa for those involved in the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean P@@ ar@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
we should also h@@ ar@@ ness im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion to as@@ s@@ is@@ t development in countries of or@@ i@@ g@@ in .
im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ te to the development of the country of or@@ i@@ g@@ in .
I know that the European Union and the Commission are working h@@ ar@@ d to achieve this .
I would ur@@ ge the Commission to go further by fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts &apos; m@@ ic@@ r@@ o @-@ projects .
in this v@@ e@@ in , I would also su@@ g@@ g@@ est se@@ t@@ t@@ ing up a monitoring c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e on m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion to st@@ u@@ d@@ y m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion f@@ l@@ o@@ ws with a view to p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing proposals to the European Union .
we must also f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ed as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation of the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean st@@ a@@ tes that so wish .
t@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ing to a proposal from Commissioner P@@ att@@ en which I find extremely in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ing , the Commissioner said that certain regional projects should be acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ble to a v@@ ar@@ i@@ able number of di@@ rec@@ tly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed Member States and Mediterranean par@@ t@@ n@@ ers on the basis of con@@ fi@@ gu@@ ra@@ tions which could v@@ ar@@ y from one pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t to another .
I support this approach as I believe it e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ es g@@ en@@ u@@ ine , and g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y st@@ r@@ on@@ g , relations between the countries to the n@@ or@@ th and s@@ ou@@ th of the Mediterranean who wish to go further together .
my f@@ ou@@ r@@ th point is that we also have to reform the management of the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme .
the Commission t@@ en@@ ds to be c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of our Mediterranean par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .
it must , however , be no@@ ted that , while it is t@@ r@@ u@@ e that some par@@ t@@ n@@ er countries have ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es , particularly because of de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent in@@ f@@ ra@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res , the under @-@ implementation of M@@ E@@ D@@ A funds is pr@@ im@@ ar@@ il@@ y the result of the Commission &apos; s in@@ ability to man@@ age these funds and to re@@ ly on op@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing them pro@@ per@@ ly .
the de@@ f@@ ence of human rights must also be made into something more than a m@@ er@@ e st@@ a@@ te@@ ment of principle , for the g@@ o@@ al is actually to as@@ s@@ is@@ t the development of con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al st@@ a@@ tes in the countries of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean , and not just to c@@ re@@ ate economic systems which f@@ it into the proposed st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment programmes .
my si@@ x@@ th point is that con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able funding must be al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated .
the de@@ ad@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ k in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st peace process is an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to any su@@ b @-@ regional d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c , be it economic , social and / or cultural .
I think the Commission should take this situation into account .
in con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion , I shall say that the or@@ g@@ an@@ ised movement of people , co@@ development and dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed cooperation are the main concerns be@@ h@@ in@@ d the report I am p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing today . I think they should also be the main concerns of the Commission .
Mr President , as d@@ ra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ per@@ s@@ on of the opinion of the Committee on C@@ ul@@ ture , Y@@ ou@@ th , E@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ation , the M@@ ed@@ i@@ a and S@@ por@@ t on the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s , I would like to com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ate some of the concerns and su@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons which have been un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly ap@@ pro@@ v@@ ed in committee .
firstly , I wish to draw attention to the need to promote cultural programmes , which I know is not what attention is u@@ su@@ ally d@@ ra@@ w@@ n to .
we know that the E@@ ur@@ om@@ ed H@@ er@@ it@@ age programme has been the most su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ful of all programmes for cooperation with the Mediterranean .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we believe that c@@ ul@@ ture pr@@ om@@ o@@ tes w@@ e@@ al@@ th .
for example , where would E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t be without its cultural t@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ m , which has been one of its main l@@ in@@ ks with the world and one of its main s@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ es of w@@ e@@ al@@ th ?
c@@ ul@@ ture , therefore , is one of the f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s which is most e@@ a@@ si@@ ly acc@@ e@@ s@@ si@@ ble , c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st to hand , most de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed and which has acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ ted the most ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence in the field of Mediterranean development , which means that it can be c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ el@@ y l@@ in@@ k@@ ed to com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation between people and can continue to open d@@ o@@ or@@ s .
at the same time we wish to draw attention to education .
we believe that if a Mediterranean trade area does not deal with the issue of education , it will become an area of Mediterranean c@@ ol@@ on@@ is@@ ation .
therefore , the only way that there can be a social s@@ ch@@ em@@ e c@@ a@@ pa@@ ble of being in@@ c@@ or@@ por@@ ated into the b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s world and the W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n world is through education .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we believe that that is where a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine and in@@ di@@ g@@ en@@ ous s@@ ch@@ em@@ e also can be f@@ ou@@ n@@ d for e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing the p@@ il@@ l@@ ar@@ s for future development .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , the only way in which we can s@@ pre@@ a@@ d our i@@ d@@ e@@ as about human rights is by c@@ re@@ ating a better tra@@ in@@ ed and better ed@@ u@@ c@@ ated population .
we are therefore not t@@ al@@ king about c@@ l@@ ic@@ h@@ é@@ s , but about re@@ al@@ ity .
another point that also concerns us is the way in which the Commission ad@@ ap@@ ts to the p@@ h@@ il@@ o@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y and c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es of the countries towards which the aid is di@@ rec@@ ted .
I believe that a large part of the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e of the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme is due to the fact that we are ap@@ pl@@ ying a European @-@ sc@@ al@@ e m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ ity , which su@@ its Commission projects .
what we need , however , is many small projects .
we need to look to the internal social st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res of the countries involved , the uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ities , the ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al institutions , the m@@ u@@ se@@ u@@ m@@ s , the cultural field , and society itself , so that we can re@@ ly on it for future development .
Mr President , the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y has on se@@ ver@@ al o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ons made con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to the debate on the European Union &apos; s Mediterranean policy and on re@@ in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ating the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
we pla@@ y@@ ed a major part in the discussion on the M@@ E@@ D@@ A ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity report that I p@@ res@@ en@@ ted on 5 S@@ e@@ p@@ te@@ m@@ b@@ er 2000 , which was adopted al@@ most un@@ an@@ im@@ ou@@ s@@ ly by Parliament , as was , mo@@ re@@ over , the amendment of the M@@ E@@ D@@ A R@@ e@@ gu@@ la@@ tion ( M@@ E@@ D@@ A I@@ I ) .
we would have l@@ i@@ k@@ ed the meeting at F@@ e@@ ir@@ a to re@@ f@@ er to the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme , since it is the main in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ment for im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing this policy and will be al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated a financial pa@@ c@@ k@@ a@@ ge of EUR 5@@ .@@ 3@@ 7 b@@ il@@ li@@ on for the per@@ i@@ o@@ d 2000 @-@ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 6 , ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ding funds from the European In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment B@@ an@@ k .
f@@ ur@@ th@@ er@@ more , we hope that this b@@ u@@ d@@ get will be in@@ c@@ re@@ a@@ se@@ d , as European Union Mediterranean policy should not have to su@@ f@@ f@@ er because of the ap@@ pro@@ p@@ ri@@ ations that have been le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te@@ ly al@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ated to the Balkans .
all the de@@ b@@ a@@ tes , re@@ g@@ ar@@ d@@ less of the committee in which they are held , whether it be F@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n Affairs , In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture or C@@ ul@@ ture , or in Parliament , are un@@ an@@ im@@ ous in con@@ st@@ an@@ tly re@@ it@@ er@@ ating the same re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations .
as far as we are concerned , we would like to st@@ res@@ s , first of all , the need to defin@@ e a Mediterranean strategy , in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with third countries . secondly , the need to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed cooperation that a@@ im@@ s to en@@ able con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts with local authorities and civil society , particularly N@@ G@@ O@@ s , for both c@@ ro@@ s@@ s @-@ b@@ order regions and in the S@@ ou@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th context , as well as for regional in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion .
th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly , we should like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t the decision of Parliament and the Commission to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out an an@@ n@@ u@@ al as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ment of the human rights situation in si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ or@@ y countries . my f@@ ou@@ r@@ th point is to st@@ res@@ s the ur@@ g@@ ent need to adopt the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter for S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity and S@@ ta@@ bility so that we can pla@@ y a more ac@@ tive role , particularly in re@@ st@@ or@@ ing peace in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st .
we consider it particularly important to encourage local measures and su@@ st@@ a@@ in@@ able development , although this was om@@ it@@ ted from the F@@ e@@ ir@@ a Council con@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , and to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve evaluation in this area , to implement major programmes on the environment and w@@ a@@ ter , to re@@ in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ate the S@@ ta@@ r@@ t programme , and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the S@@ i@@ x@@ th R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch F@@ ra@@ m@@ e@@ work P@@ ro@@ gra@@ m@@ me of re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical development .
the Committee on In@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ r@@ y , E@@ x@@ ter@@ n@@ al T@@ ra@@ de , R@@ e@@ se@@ ar@@ ch and E@@ n@@ er@@ g@@ y g@@ a@@ ve its un@@ an@@ im@@ ous opinion on this r@@ an@@ ge of qu@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ ons .
Mr President , as@@ su@@ m@@ ing a d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing role in the European Union means im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ing a s@@ er@@ ies of gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es which have th@@ us far ex@@ is@@ ted more on pa@@ per than as part of p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al action .
we have already com@@ m@@ it@@ ted ourselves to de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing a la@@ st@@ ing par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p with North A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a , A@@ si@@ a M@@ in@@ or and the B@@ al@@ k@@ an st@@ a@@ tes , but we are pu@@ r@@ su@@ ing this too s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ly .
it is one of the d@@ u@@ ti@@ es of Europe , which has the ta@@ s@@ k of being the d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force of a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ed system of trade , the market , development , g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and economic pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
this is also necessary in order to st@@ e@@ m the dis@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ing m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion f@@ l@@ o@@ ws of this last dec@@ ad@@ e , which are a clear in@@ d@@ ic@@ ation of the lack of a b@@ il@@ a@@ te@@ ra@@ l cooperation policy .
it is p@@ rec@@ is@@ el@@ y from these last two issues that we must start if we g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y want to re@@ st@@ or@@ e the Mediterranean area to its for@@ m@@ er g@@ l@@ or@@ y and , above all , to re@@ su@@ me our le@@ ad@@ ing role with political di@@ g@@ n@@ ity .
it is essential for Europe to be at the f@@ o@@ re@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t in this g@@ e@@ o @-@ political sc@@ en@@ ar@@ i@@ o , using the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents as s@@ pr@@ in@@ g@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds towards the financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments g@@ r@@ an@@ ted by the E@@ I@@ B and , in particular , by the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme .
at the same time , the ad@@ op@@ tion of the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter for P@@ e@@ ac@@ e and S@@ ta@@ bility , in which the two si@@ d@@ es of the Mediterranean co@@ op@@ er@@ ate ac@@ ti@@ v@@ el@@ y and the b@@ a@@ se@@ s of which d@@ er@@ i@@ ve from the rights of in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ als , of the family uni@@ t , of cultural di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and of re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ous dialogue , cannot be put o@@ f@@ f any longer .
in fact , the issue of im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion , which is one of the g@@ re@@ a@@ te@@ st ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es , must be ta@@ c@@ k@@ led in respect for cultural and h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences and itself become a means of development .
it cannot be d@@ en@@ i@@ ed that the European la@@ b@@ our re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ments are con@@ st@@ an@@ tly in@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ing , but , at the same time , we must put an end to il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and the n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous ex@@ is@@ t@@ ing cases of il@@ legal tra@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ king .
f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to establish an effective , s@@ ol@@ i@@ d b@@ ar@@ ri@@ er b@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ king all that wor@@ ks against le@@ g@@ al@@ ity or the la@@ ws of democracy can only ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate di@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on , an@@ no@@ y@@ ance and even v@@ i@@ ol@@ ence once again , which would c@@ an@@ c@@ e@@ l out all the e@@ f@@ for@@ t put in and un@@ do any progress made in dialogue th@@ us far .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Swedish Presidency se@@ es the EU &apos; s Mediterranean cooperation as an important and p@@ res@@ sing issue .
I therefore l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ed with great interest to Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i &apos; s and Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r &apos; s p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tions of their reports .
it is gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying to no@@ te that c@@ r@@ it@@ ic@@ is@@ m@@ s made in both reports re@@ la@@ te to the Swedish Presidency &apos; s main priorities .
in political terms , the presidency w@@ is@@ h@@ es to promote democracy and human rights , social and economic progress and progress on environmental matters and , in addition , e@@ quality and the st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ le against various for@@ m@@ s of dis@@ c@@ r@@ im@@ in@@ ation .
in the economic and financial s@@ p@@ here , we want to work towards an economic and financial par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p which is both d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c and has a human f@@ ac@@ e .
the con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ d@@ es both economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th and social e@@ qu@@ il@@ i@@ b@@ ri@@ u@@ m .
to d@@ ate , no con@@ f@@ er@@ ence of trade min@@ is@@ ters has been held within the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s , in s@@ p@@ it@@ e of the fact that trade and the ec@@ on@@ om@@ y form one of the three p@@ il@@ l@@ ar@@ s of B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a cooperation .
the presidency is therefore going to ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge a meeting in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing the 2@@ 7 countries &apos; trade min@@ is@@ ters .
the a@@ i@@ m is to give a d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c ed@@ ge to the most important aspects of trade co@@ v@@ e@@ red by the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s and to agree upon the gu@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es for con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed work .
the need for regional in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion is another important issue which should be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed .
other priority se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de rules of or@@ i@@ g@@ in , acc@@ u@@ m@@ u@@ la@@ tion , h@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ is@@ ation measures , n@@ or@@ m@@ s and st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ ds and in@@ te@@ l@@ le@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ al pro@@ per@@ ty protection .
in this context , I also wish to point out that the presidency s@@ ha@@ res the view that agricultural products ou@@ g@@ h@@ t not to be ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded from the free @-@ trade dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
it is also important to encourage and support trade and cooperation between the par@@ t@@ n@@ er countries themselves .
this is a n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ ted area in which a great deal must and can be done .
more than fi@@ ve years have g@@ one by since the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s was em@@ b@@ ar@@ k@@ ed upon .
a l@@ o@@ t has been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , but it has not been possible to implement many of the pl@@ ans .
to some ex@@ t@@ ent , the way matters st@@ and in the peace process has re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted the p@@ o@@ t@@ en@@ ti@@ al for progress , but other f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s too have had a part to pla@@ y .
we are con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed that a good deal can and should be done to give more im@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ s to Mediterranean cooperation and to make everyone involved feel that they own more of the process .
I shall therefore be l@@ is@@ t@@ en@@ ing with great interest to today &apos; s debate , which I am con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed will make a v@@ al@@ u@@ able contribution to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing the EU &apos; s Mediterranean cooperation .
Mr President , I would like to start by th@@ an@@ king the two ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s , Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i and Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r , who have pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed s@@ ou@@ n@@ d , high @-@ quality reports on the future of the Mediterranean policy .
mo@@ re@@ over , com@@ m@@ er@@ c@@ i@@ al in@@ te@@ re@@ x@@ change is important for Europe , and it is also important to be able to provide and guarantee v@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al training and a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , and also support and ad@@ v@@ ice in respect of the c@@ ur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es of these countries , for , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , the free @-@ trade area will then have to become a e@@ ur@@ o z@@ one .
this is what we ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t .
however , I feel that the European Union needs to do an about @-@ t@@ u@@ r@@ n for , in my opinion , the current line is to w@@ i@@ th@@ draw from the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts and com@@ m@@ it@@ ments .
the c@@ u@@ t@@ back in the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme , for reasons which I see as ex@@ c@@ u@@ se@@ s , and d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p pro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ses are al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing .
dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations of pr@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es have been f@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed not by action but by d@@ el@@ a@@ y@@ s in action .
we must pro@@ ve w@@ r@@ on@@ g the th@@ e@@ or@@ y that enlargement means a dec@@ line in interest in the Mediterranean .
we call for dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve re@@ ver@@ sa@@ l of the t@@ r@@ end ; we also call for res@@ ol@@ u@@ te commitment to the Mediterranean peace process between I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ is and P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans , and not just between these two p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es but in the en@@ ti@@ r@@ e area , to ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the problems of the L@@ e@@ b@@ an@@ on , S@@ y@@ ri@@ a , I@@ ra@@ q and I@@ r@@ an , so that all this can bring peace and t@@ r@@ an@@ qu@@ il@@ l@@ ity to that region of the world .
let us therefore make our Mediterranean a se@@ a of peace - for it used to be a se@@ a of c@@ ul@@ ture - where children , women and citizens can trade and mo@@ ve f@@ re@@ el@@ y throughout the area .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s and point out that this debate has b@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t progress in Parliament &apos;s position on the issue of the Mediterranean policy , progress which is extremely important because , a@@ part from an@@ y@@ th@@ ing el@@ se , over and above the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ences between political groups , I can see that we have common g@@ r@@ ou@@ n@@ d on this matter which ad@@ ds to our st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th and the st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th of the European institutions .
the Union &apos;s E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean strategy is just as important as its strategy on enlargement to in@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ de the countries of C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe , but we have ou@@ t@@ l@@ in@@ ed a p@@ at@@ h to follow for enlargement w@@ h@@ e@@ re@@ as we are still se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing for a strategy for the Mediterranean policy , even though we have the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed by B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a be@@ h@@ in@@ d us and despite the region &apos;s n@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ous problems , st@@ ar@@ ting with the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ al conflict .
I will not d@@ well on this as the matter will be dis@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed la@@ ter on when Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a is here .
for now , I just want to say that we call for a more ac@@ tive , more su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al role to be pla@@ y@@ ed by the European governments , g@@ i@@ v@@ ing the H@@ i@@ g@@ h R@@ e@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive the power to de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p a policy which is not in conflict with or an al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve to the policy of the United States , but is much more su@@ b@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al than the strategy currently em@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed by Europe with regard to the par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e j@@ o@@ b , I re@@ g@@ re@@ t to say , we cannot do for them .
we must therefore always be@@ a@@ r in mind that the agreement must be based , first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most , on under@@ st@@ an@@ ding and dialogue between the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans and I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ is .
on the other hand , we cannot l@@ o@@ s@@ e si@@ g@@ h@@ t of other areas of conflict such as the W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ a .
we must n@@ e@@ v@@ er for@@ get that the United N@@ ations ex@@ is@@ t@@ s but that , within that framework , there is ro@@ o@@ m for a European initiative , and my opinion is that , at the moment , there is ro@@ o@@ m for a European initiative in the W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ a issue and that we could put an end to this last c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al b@@ att@@ le .
on the subject of the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p , I feel that we should ta@@ c@@ k@@ le the more recent aspects , to which we in@@ v@@ ite the Commission and the Council to at@@ ta@@ ch more importance than we have here today .
I would like to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on human rights and the r@@ u@@ le of law .
the C@@ h@@ ar@@ ter of F@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l Rights of the European Union re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ted a con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ able st@@ e@@ p for@@ w@@ ar@@ ds : that is , we ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge that the social and in@@ di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ u@@ al rights of all people are rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised on Union ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y .
this pla@@ c@@ es us in a position where we can have dialogue with these countries , ta@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ ing the question of a E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ sh@@ i@@ p where human rights issues are not a question of us in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ing in their a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s but of the common need to establish v@@ al@@ u@@ es which are at the basis of the kind of p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful co@@ ex@@ is@@ t@@ ence we want .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , with regard to im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion , I would ar@@ gu@@ e that it is in both our and their interest to fi@@ g@@ h@@ t il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion and therefore establish a European @-@ sc@@ al@@ e policy .
with regard to ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture , I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very e@@ as@@ y to say that we are going to open up ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture to free trade as well .
you must re@@ al@@ ise , gentlemen , that , even now , when they are subject to d@@ u@@ ti@@ es , our products are already com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve with local products on the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts of those countries : let us therefore take c@@ are for li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation could d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y a sector which is of v@@ it@@ al importance for some countries .
our M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds re@@ mind us that ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture means k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing people in the c@@ ou@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ si@@ d@@ e , ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing employment and pro@@ te@@ c@@ ting the environment .
let us therefore a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d su@@ per@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al@@ ity and un@@ d@@ u@@ e ha@@ st@@ e in de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ing st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ es on se@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ s where we need to progress in a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p which does not h@@ ar@@ m these countries .
Mr President , I would firstly like to o@@ f@@ f@@ er our th@@ an@@ ks for the work carried out by Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i and Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r and for their rec@@ e@@ p@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s to our proposals , and I would also like to say that our group su@@ p@@ por@@ ts both reports .
more s@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ally , I would like to h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ t some positive aspects which have been in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed , particularly in the field of human rights , and more especially an amendment from our group which as@@ ks for con@@ d@@ em@@ n@@ ation of the death pen@@ al@@ ty and a m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m on pen@@ ding ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tions .
it would be cause for great hope if the m@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ i@@ u@@ m were to take effect im@@ m@@ ed@@ i@@ a@@ te@@ ly .
on a different issue , I would also like to ex@@ p@@ res@@ s our con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ence in the im@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ u@@ s that the amendments provide in the regional and local field and to civil society , especially to p@@ ri@@ va@@ te in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment as a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force for development , over and above state aid and European aid at the h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est level .
I will not go into any more de@@ ta@@ i@@ l , because I believe that the main points have been made clear by Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i and Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r in their s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es .
however , I would like to make two ob@@ s@@ er@@ va@@ tions in relation to the de@@ b@@ a@@ tes which we have held in committee and in our group .
one of these concerns political priorities and the other concerns the co@@ h@@ er@@ ence of our actions .
we do not all believe that we have to set the priority of enlargement towards the E@@ a@@ st against the priority of the Mediterranean .
I also believe that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mrs L@@ in@@ d@@ h , made this clear the other day in committee .
they are two real priorities but they are different .
enlargement is an op@@ er@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al priority for which we have set objectives , we know where we are going and we know what we want and , in re@@ al@@ ity , there are no al@@ ter@@ n@@ a@@ ti@@ ve st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c op@@ tions .
on the other hand , Mediterranean policy is a st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c priority , in which we do not know where we are going or , to be more p@@ rec@@ ise , we are mo@@ v@@ ing in@@ ex@@ or@@ ab@@ ly towards a place to which we do not want to go .
the f@@ o@@ re@@ se@@ e@@ able change in in@@ come , be@@ ar@@ ing in mind current d@@ em@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y and economic g@@ ro@@ w@@ th , in@@ d@@ ic@@ a@@ tes that our a@@ ver@@ age per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come will r@@ ise and the a@@ ver@@ age per c@@ ap@@ it@@ a in@@ come in North A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a will dec@@ re@@ a@@ se and , un@@ less this is pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted , the problems we all en@@ v@@ is@@ age , and which there is no need to m@@ en@@ tion , will increase .
we know what will ha@@ p@@ p@@ en , but we do not know how to pre@@ v@@ ent it , although we want to pre@@ v@@ ent it at all costs .
let us not , therefore , set political priorities against one another .
my other point concerns the co@@ h@@ er@@ ence of our actions , because , in order to get results , we must be more co@@ h@@ er@@ ent .
clearly , we need will and we need resources , but , in fact , resources are not being used ; and this means that there is in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity for management on our part , and there is in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ent c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity for ab@@ s@@ or@@ p@@ tion on the part of the rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing countries .
more is re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed and then is not used .
therefore , s@@ om@@ e@@ b@@ od@@ y should ask &apos; why do we not re@@ ad@@ just the fi@@ gu@@ res ? &apos;
but what we really need is a b@@ u@@ d@@ get and it must be used .
for all these reasons I believe that we need con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion as well as the c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity for ab@@ s@@ or@@ p@@ tion .
I hope that these reports will help us to find the cor@@ rec@@ t m@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ d , but quite h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ ly I am not con@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ ed they will .
Mr President , I am going to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on an as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of the common strategy for the Mediterranean region which is not being taken into account in all res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts : the S@@ ou@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th dialogue , which is an important d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing force within the strategy for relations between the European Union and the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b countries .
the c@@ re@@ ation of c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed authorities and m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s which th@@ or@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ly m@@ on@@ it@@ or the most p@@ res@@ sing problems is essential .
the management of projects on specific points and on common aspects is a need which has become a real one in relation to cases in which , on a p@@ ri@@ va@@ te level , citizens and c@@ ities from both si@@ d@@ es of the S@@ tra@@ its of G@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ al@@ ta@@ r have been co@@ op@@ er@@ ating with w@@ on@@ d@@ er@@ ful results and without Community p@@ at@@ r@@ on@@ age .
for the pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses of this local management , it would be necessary to c@@ re@@ ate a new b@@ od@@ y which , as a dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed and per@@ man@@ ent m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m , would bring together all the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al , political and social le@@ ad@@ ers of these ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies which are so c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ e and yet so far a@@ way .
the 1@@ 4 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ res which se@@ par@@ ate the European Union from the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b are real , but let us ensure that this does not become an in@@ su@@ per@@ able d@@ is@@ t@@ ance which pre@@ v@@ ents the c@@ l@@ o@@ se@@ st possible cooperation .
im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion , its c@@ a@@ u@@ ses and consequences - which are s@@ om@@ e@@ ti@@ m@@ es ter@@ ri@@ ble and ir@@ re@@ par@@ able - b@@ u@@ s@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s , agricultural and fishing ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ es , social , technical , ed@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ es , aspects of common development , such as those in the energy sector , and the essential d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ t@@ is@@ ing political aspects which the European Union must promote in those countries all re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e the c@@ re@@ ation of new m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s and in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments which , in a dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ed f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion , would res@@ p@@ on@@ d to these needs , which are local but which have w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ pre@@ a@@ d re@@ per@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ ons .
Mr President , although the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s raised h@@ op@@ es and ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , today we must re@@ g@@ is@@ ter dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment .
what y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day were la@@ u@@ d@@ able a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons , such as c@@ al@@ l@@ s for an area of s@@ ha@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , for a b@@ al@@ an@@ c@@ ing of North and S@@ ou@@ th , a commitment to en@@ h@@ an@@ c@@ ing peace and st@@ ability , are now ur@@ g@@ ent issues .
while we all see the need to re@@ la@@ un@@ ch the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p , there is , however , a di@@ ver@@ g@@ ence in the op@@ tions we favour .
the future of the very con@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ t of a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p li@@ es not in ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ing the needs of these p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tions to the market for@@ c@@ es at work in the North and to our per@@ s@@ on@@ al a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons , but in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d in en@@ sur@@ ing their own development and res@@ ol@@ v@@ ing their ur@@ g@@ ent issues .
I believe , therefore , that Europe should adopt some approach other than simply su@@ p@@ por@@ ting these countries in e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing the free @-@ trade area that Europe was to set up .
en@@ ab@@ ling cooperation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents , particularly through public services , se@@ e@@ king other financial resources , by in@@ t@@ ro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing a T@@ ob@@ in @-@ st@@ y@@ le tax , for example , and re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing or even w@@ r@@ it@@ ing o@@ f@@ f de@@ b@@ t would give real su@@ b@@ st@@ ance to a f@@ a@@ i@@ r and u@@ se@@ ful par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
this approach would favour North @-@ S@@ ou@@ th relations without the el@@ ement of d@@ om@@ in@@ ation .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to human rights .
our as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations with countries in the Mediterranean region can only be b@@ u@@ il@@ t on t@@ r@@ u@@ st . we are , therefore , extremely concerned about human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations in T@@ un@@ is@@ i@@ a , for example , because the ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents si@@ g@@ n@@ ed by both parties ob@@ li@@ ge them to respect human rights .
the same ap@@ p@@ li@@ es to the European Union &apos; s respect for the rights of all citizens .
I am th@@ in@@ king here of the need for a more in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted and more g@@ en@@ er@@ ous approach to m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
it is in@@ human and in@@ effective to ad@@ v@@ o@@ c@@ ate the free movement of g@@ o@@ od@@ s and c@@ ap@@ it@@ al but not of people .
ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s that c@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ ing b@@ or@@ d@@ ers s@@ er@@ v@@ es only to force im@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ an@@ ts with no i@@ d@@ ent@@ ity pa@@ per@@ s and no rights into the h@@ an@@ ds of s@@ m@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ ers and other un@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ pu@@ l@@ ous de@@ al@@ ers .
how can we speak of man@@ ag@@ ing im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion in a more h@@ u@@ man@@ e m@@ an@@ n@@ er , how can we hope and p@@ ra@@ y for further in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion , if we do not question its f@@ ou@@ n@@ d@@ ations ?
we must sa@@ f@@ e@@ gu@@ ar@@ d the freedom of movement of per@@ s@@ ons and e@@ quality in social , economic , cultural and political rights .
to su@@ m up , in order to c@@ re@@ ate an area of peace in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st , the European Union needs to take much more di@@ rec@@ t and res@@ ol@@ u@@ te action .
from now on , the United N@@ ations res@@ ol@@ u@@ tions must be ap@@ p@@ li@@ ed in full , I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l must respect its com@@ m@@ it@@ ments and we must rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ise the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans &apos; le@@ g@@ it@@ i@@ ma@@ te right to their own state .
the same problem - I am about to fin@@ ish - can be seen in the W@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ n S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ a , where there is a r@@ is@@ k that ar@@ m@@ ed conflict will be re@@ su@@ m@@ ed .
despite all this , the European Union has e@@ ver@@ y@@ th@@ ing to g@@ a@@ in by b@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing together all parties , such as as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ations , local authorities and uni@@ ons , who are already e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ing a different form of par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p .
Mr President , Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i &apos; s report on Mediterranean policy , or what c@@ la@@ im@@ s to be a report on this subject , st@@ an@@ ds out , first of all , for one si@@ m@@ p@@ le reason but one that is always dis@@ re@@ g@@ ar@@ ded in this C@@ ha@@ m@@ b@@ er .
at long last , it pu@@ ts the problem of common f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy back in its natural context , by which I mean the g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical context , i@@ .@@ e@@ . p@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ al s@@ pa@@ ce , the con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ta@@ tion of land and se@@ a , the g@@ r@@ ou@@ p@@ ing of n@@ ations in terms of their own areas of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , their own b@@ on@@ ds and their own com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ity of interests , even if these are f@@ o@@ c@@ used a@@ way from those of the m@@ y@@ th@@ ical Europe , a con@@ t@@ in@@ ent so in@@ t@@ an@@ g@@ i@@ ble that it does not have any real b@@ or@@ d@@ ers .
so this report pu@@ ts f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy back into context .
as I mentioned , g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical position is the re@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ it@@ or@@ y or s@@ an@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ary , if you pre@@ f@@ er , or , in other words , the n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive which en@@ ab@@ l@@ es us to re@@ a@@ d , understand and h@@ ence respect the in@@ v@@ ar@@ i@@ able political f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s that are d@@ ic@@ ta@@ ted by g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y .
this s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ s , mo@@ re@@ over , just how pro@@ b@@ le@@ ma@@ ti@@ c , if not , as we might more acc@@ u@@ ra@@ te@@ ly say , im@@ possible , it is to implement a common f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy through pa@@ th@@ e@@ ti@@ c pu@@ p@@ p@@ et@@ s such as S@@ ol@@ an@@ a .
yet , the way that political Europe currently op@@ er@@ a@@ tes a@@ u@@ t@@ om@@ a@@ ti@@ c@@ ally rules out the g@@ e@@ o @-@ political approach since , as there is no defin@@ ition of what con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes Europe &apos; s common interest - by which I mean a European res pu@@ b@@ l@@ ic@@ a - it still f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s , after all the u@@ su@@ al free @-@ for @-@ al@@ l@@ s , the law of the j@@ un@@ g@@ le , al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing the st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ est at any given time to make the re@@ st of the 1@@ 5 support its st@@ ra@@ te@@ g@@ i@@ c c@@ h@@ o@@ ic@@ es , even if it has to s@@ h@@ o@@ ve them down their th@@ ro@@ at@@ s .
we therefore come to understand that , in this g@@ a@@ me , the u@@ p@@ per hand on Mediterranean policy , as well as on many other su@@ b@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , is held by n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n Europe - i@@ .@@ e@@ . G@@ re@@ at B@@ r@@ it@@ a@@ in p@@ l@@ u@@ s G@@ er@@ many and its age @-@ ol@@ d al@@ l@@ ies . that is why priority has clearly been given to enlargement to the n@@ or@@ th and to the e@@ a@@ st including the Balkans , where we are pa@@ ying the pr@@ ice of G@@ er@@ m@@ an policy , while our f@@ ri@@ en@@ ds in the Mediterranean region be@@ a@@ r the costs of every ad@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ ment .
therefore , the rapporteur and my good f@@ ri@@ end , Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r , are both j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied in d@@ en@@ ou@@ n@@ c@@ ing Europe &apos; s lack of commitment to the Mediterranean region and M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s .
I would just like to ad@@ d that all the L@@ at@@ in countries may s@@ o@@ on@@ er or la@@ ter re@@ j@@ ec@@ t , perhaps even v@@ i@@ ol@@ ently re@@ j@@ ec@@ t the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ t of a future which re@@ le@@ g@@ a@@ tes them to the si@@ d@@ el@@ in@@ es of a group over which they no longer have any in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence .
even today , we believe that it is the d@@ u@@ ty of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n European n@@ ations , or rather the n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean n@@ ations , to work together with the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean countries , firstly , the three M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b countries , M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ o , A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a and T@@ un@@ is@@ i@@ a , to c@@ re@@ ate this area of s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity , which is a part of our h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y and g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ y and that is , mo@@ re@@ over , of importance to us in the c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y that is just be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing .
Mr President , the two reports which we are de@@ b@@ ating today have at least one th@@ ing in common : they con@@ ta@@ in a whole ra@@ f@@ t of un@@ f@@ ul@@ f@@ il@@ la@@ ble w@@ is@@ h@@ es and de@@ si@@ res with regard to the Mediterranean region .
fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally , we simply lack the resources to do an a@@ w@@ ful l@@ o@@ t and what is more , the European Union &apos; s external relations have been such that we cannot a@@ f@@ for@@ d to be over@@ ly con@@ f@@ i@@ d@@ ent .
it is high time we e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed priorities , th@@ us al@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing us to do the things we do ou@@ t@@ si@@ d@@ e the Union well .
recent st@@ a@@ te@@ ments made by Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a con@@ f@@ ir@@ m the need to p@@ ri@@ or@@ it@@ ise .
he re@@ f@@ er@@ red to the Union &apos; s strategy d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments , including those with regard to the Mediterranean countries , as pu@@ re@@ ly b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es .
i@@ d@@ e@@ as on pa@@ per h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly ever t@@ u@@ r@@ n into re@@ al@@ ity in practice .
however , the en@@ d@@ less rec@@ it@@ als and par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h@@ s in the d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ments before us do ra@@ ise ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions a@@ m@@ on@@ g our par@@ t@@ n@@ ers , ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions which we cannot p@@ o@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ly f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l , because we also have other res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
both reports are dis@@ par@@ ag@@ ing about those other res@@ p@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ ities .
acc@@ or@@ d@@ ing to the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s , our re@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ sh@@ i@@ p with c@@ an@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ ate countries , in particular , has led to the n@@ e@@ g@@ le@@ c@@ t of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n countries , and that must now be put right .
however , I do not agree with this line of th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t .
enlargement d@@ e@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ es all our attention in the n@@ e@@ a@@ r future .
if we want to do this pro@@ per@@ ly , we will have our h@@ an@@ ds full .
there is therefore certainly no ch@@ ance of s@@ pen@@ ding as much money on our s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ ly n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ s , certainly not if we be@@ a@@ r in mind how re@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ t Member States are to put more money into the Union &apos; s f@@ un@@ d .
A@@ d@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally , both reports take an op@@ ti@@ mis@@ ti@@ c view of the Union &apos; s in@@ f@@ l@@ u@@ ence in the political ar@@ en@@ a .
we should not be under any il@@ l@@ u@@ si@@ ons , particularly when it comes to the role which the European Union could pla@@ y in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le @-@ E@@ a@@ st peace process .
I re@@ g@@ re@@ t that both reports r@@ u@@ n the r@@ is@@ k of not being taken s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ly due to un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c g@@ o@@ als .
indeed , the European Union could very well be of si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance , especially in the economic s@@ en@@ se , but also when it comes to the problem of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
we should only concern ourselves with matters where the European Union can provide ad@@ ded v@@ al@@ u@@ e and can really be of si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ance .
being m@@ od@@ est as to in our ab@@ il@@ ities will en@@ h@@ an@@ ce the quality of the European Union &apos; s external relations .
Mr President , as the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ tive of a country that once had di@@ rec@@ t access to the Mediterranean , I would like to con@@ v@@ e@@ y my ex@@ p@@ res@@ s support for f@@ o@@ st@@ er@@ ing better relations between the EU and the Mediterranean region , and acc@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ g@@ ly , for this report .
it is not just a political , but also a h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical commitment we must make .
n@@ e@@ ed@@ less to say , the EU &apos; s ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ities with regard to se@@ c@@ ur@@ ing peace in the Mediterranean , especially in relation to the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e of conflict in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st , con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ te a special responsibility , which , sa@@ d@@ ly , the re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es and members of the European Union , and particularly their f@@ o@@ re@@ i@@ g@@ n policy re@@ p@@ res@@ en@@ ta@@ ti@@ v@@ es , have been u@@ n@@ e@@ qu@@ al to in the past .
however , the pu@@ r@@ su@@ it of an a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ous and ac@@ tive European peace policy must re@@ main one of the EU &apos; s g@@ o@@ als .
that said , there are also other reasons be@@ si@@ d@@ es the security aspects , as to why it is important for the EU to pla@@ y a more ac@@ tive role in the Mediterranean region .
the EU cannot , n@@ or should it , s@@ par@@ e any ex@@ pen@@ se in the social and cultural s@@ p@@ he@@ res , in su@@ p@@ por@@ ting d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments , in in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ ing in the e@@ v@@ ent of human rights v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations , in pr@@ om@@ o@@ t@@ ing economic development , and in im@@ pro@@ v@@ ing dialogue and cooperation in as many areas as possible , if it w@@ an@@ ts to see dis@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ i@@ ble progress .
if we are to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d all these proposals , as de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed in the report , re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing no more than dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ations of in@@ t@@ ent , we will need to work on the l@@ is@@ t of priorities , which has also been called for in this House , and which se@@ ts out in p@@ rec@@ ise terms the order in which these in@@ t@@ en@@ tions are to be carried out and the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ing th@@ e@@ re@@ of .
in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ ally , my t@@ one was not one of re@@ g@@ re@@ t when I mentioned our for@@ m@@ er access to the Mediterranean .
Mr President , as we can d@@ ed@@ u@@ ce from the s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es by the ra@@ p@@ por@@ te@@ ur@@ s , and at this stage it is h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly necessary to re@@ p@@ e@@ at it , the Mediterranean region must be one of the European Union &apos; s h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ est priorities , because the problems of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean - the political u@@ p@@ he@@ a@@ v@@ al@@ s , the economic st@@ ag@@ n@@ ation , the population g@@ ro@@ w@@ th - a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ t us , di@@ rec@@ tly or in@@ di@@ rec@@ tly , as E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans .
ex@@ a@@ m@@ pl@@ es of this are the m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion f@@ l@@ o@@ ws in our di@@ rec@@ tion , the de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation of our environment and the d@@ an@@ g@@ ers p@@ res@@ en@@ ted to our society by ra@@ d@@ ical f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ t@@ al@@ is@@ m .
in su@@ m@@ mar@@ y , b@@ al@@ ance on our s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n b@@ order is essential to our st@@ ability .
it is therefore important that we share the view that the Union &apos; s natural de@@ si@@ r@@ e for enlargement towards C@@ ent@@ ra@@ l and E@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ n Europe must not le@@ a@@ d to a de@@ te@@ ri@@ or@@ ation of its policy towards the Mediterranean .
therefore , while in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 my group su@@ p@@ por@@ ted and st@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ ly pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted the open process in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a which , at last , after al@@ most 4@@ 0 years , d@@ re@@ w up a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al strategy for the Community countries in relation to the Mediterranean countries , it now su@@ p@@ por@@ ts the objective con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in the reports which we are de@@ b@@ ating today to st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
in particular , in relation to Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r &apos; s report , we have t@@ ri@@ ed to improve it in committee by means of various con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions and I would like to thank the rapporteur for being rec@@ e@@ p@@ tive towards them .
we have in@@ s@@ is@@ ted on the importance of st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ing in@@ ter@@ par@@ li@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ r@@ y dialogue , which must be con@@ s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ated as one of the key el@@ em@@ ents in bo@@ o@@ st@@ ing the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s .
we would like to point out that we should promote the li@@ b@@ er@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the economic systems of our Mediterranean par@@ t@@ n@@ ers and c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out the st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ ra@@ l ch@@ an@@ g@@ es necessary to com@@ p@@ et@@ e in more open mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts .
we have proposed the c@@ re@@ ation of a monitoring c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e for m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion f@@ l@@ o@@ ws , responsible a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st other things for c@@ re@@ ating m@@ ec@@ h@@ an@@ is@@ m@@ s to com@@ b@@ at , in a co@@ or@@ d@@ in@@ ated f@@ a@@ sh@@ ion , the ma@@ fi@@ as which prof@@ it from il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion .
we would like to point out that relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries are based on a g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al strategy , one of the el@@ em@@ ents of which is un@@ d@@ ou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly fishing , and therefore we t@@ r@@ u@@ st that the M@@ or@@ o@@ c@@ can Government will adopt an att@@ it@@ u@@ de which re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts the current ur@@ g@@ ency in the n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ations which are taking place .
finally we would like to point out to the Commission that , within the framework of the re@@ for@@ m@@ s taking place in its external s@@ er@@ v@@ ice , the human resources d@@ ed@@ ic@@ ated to the Mediterranean as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation need to be re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ed , a specific st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture needs to be e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed in the Commission , and progress needs to be made on the de@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion and dec@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ ation of aid .
in su@@ m@@ mar@@ y , my group is in favour of the European Union pla@@ ying a b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er role in the Mediterranean and we hope that human and ma@@ te@@ ri@@ al resources are pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ed that are a ma@@ t@@ ch for the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es f@@ ac@@ ing us .
Mr President , the idea that the Mediterranean is the number one priority of European Union external policy st@@ em@@ s from the con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion that , although the Mediterranean is no longer the c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e of the world , each and every one of the great con@@ tra@@ d@@ ic@@ tions and ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es of the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y are con@@ c@@ ent@@ ra@@ ted there .
the Mediterranean pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c example of the issue of war and peace .
the issue of North @-@ S@@ ou@@ th relations is s@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ c@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly al@@ i@@ ve in the Mediterranean .
the very f@@ a@@ sh@@ i@@ on@@ able issue of the c@@ la@@ s@@ h of c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res or dialogue between c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ res is s@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ ised by the Mediterranean .
the em@@ er@@ g@@ ence of x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ b@@ i@@ a and ra@@ c@@ is@@ m , or t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance and m@@ u@@ l@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ al@@ is@@ m , is most in@@ t@@ en@@ s@@ el@@ y il@@ l@@ u@@ st@@ ra@@ ted in the Mediterranean .
the question of democracy and human rights or a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ar@@ i@@ an@@ is@@ m is al@@ i@@ ve in the Mediterranean and will continue to be so in the com@@ ing years .
the issue of regional res@@ p@@ on@@ ses to the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ g@@ es of g@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ al@@ is@@ ation is being raised in the Mediterranean .
the issue of women &apos; s em@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ pa@@ tion or re@@ p@@ res@@ sion is also at its most in@@ t@@ en@@ se in the Mediterranean region .
there is no need to in@@ s@@ is@@ t therefore that this is our f@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l priority , because the pro@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ ts for its future re@@ main com@@ p@@ le@@ te@@ ly open , while enlargement will take time , it will have its costs and its problems , but the only re@@ as@@ on@@ able ou@@ t@@ come that an@@ y@@ one can i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine is that it will e@@ v@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ally take place .
in the Mediterranean , a &apos; s@@ an@@ d@@ b@@ el@@ t &apos; or a &apos; s@@ l@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ el@@ t &apos; may be c@@ re@@ ated in the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y , and both issues are d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ted .
the two con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions p@@ res@@ en@@ ted here today , in the European Parliament , are con@@ t@@ ri@@ b@@ u@@ tions to the re@@ la@@ un@@ ch of the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean policy .
I believe that Mr P@@ att@@ en and Mr S@@ ol@@ an@@ a would do very well to re@@ a@@ d these reports , and in particular , the report by my f@@ ri@@ end and te@@ ac@@ her , S@@ a@@ m@@ i N@@ a@@ ï@@ r , because it makes a very co@@ h@@ er@@ ent and well put together l@@ is@@ t of th@@ em@@ es , which c@@ al@@ l@@ s for a political proposal .
this policy was well defin@@ ed in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a fi@@ ve years ago but today it needs not only a new ex@@ p@@ res@@ sion of will but also the ability to implement initiatives .
we must achieve - above all in the Mediterranean , and we M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ e@@ ans know this - something very important : things need to be ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed .
n@@ e@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ e@@ s@@ s , if an@@ y@@ th@@ ing is la@@ c@@ king today , it is s@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ ic specific action , a st@@ r@@ on@@ g si@@ g@@ n@@ al that the Union , the Council , the Commission and Parliament , are t@@ r@@ u@@ ly in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in this re@@ la@@ un@@ ch , which g@@ o@@ es be@@ y@@ on@@ d words and s@@ p@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ es .
in this regard , I would like to draw attention to an as@@ p@@ ec@@ t of S@@ a@@ m@@ i N@@ a@@ ï@@ r &apos; s report : the need to c@@ re@@ ate st@@ r@@ on@@ g initiatives in the fi@@ el@@ ds of S@@ ou@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th trade and for su@@ b@@ regional in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion or in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean region . we need something st@@ r@@ on@@ g .
I do not know ex@@ ac@@ tly what it may be , but it must t@@ r@@ u@@ ly w@@ in over public opinion in the S@@ ou@@ th so that people can see that the European Union clearly has , as well as a well d@@ ra@@ w@@ n @-@ up policy , the will to c@@ re@@ ate b@@ an@@ king and financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments , ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s that le@@ a@@ d to su@@ b@@ regional in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion in the S@@ ou@@ th or n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks of roads and m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s .
this m@@ e@@ s@@ sa@@ ge must make a g@@ en@@ u@@ ine contribution to this r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ al of the will for in@@ te@@ gra@@ tion which , above all in the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b , is a cause for hope at the moment and which must c@@ ou@@ n@@ t on an a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous and also g@@ en@@ er@@ ous contribution from the Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I certainly en@@ d@@ or@@ se the line taken by Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i and Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r &apos;s reports , and their con@@ t@@ ent , but there is a need to f@@ o@@ c@@ us on certain f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ s which are not de@@ al@@ t with .
it is important to start from this con@@ si@@ d@@ er@@ ation : the European Union &apos;s strategy for the Mediterranean , de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed at F@@ e@@ ir@@ a , in addition to f@@ a@@ il@@ ing to provide p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al re@@ com@@ m@@ en@@ d@@ ations , does not take into account certain de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ments which have taken place in recent years in the Mediterranean B@@ as@@ in . after c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ ri@@ es of st@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ling and mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ is@@ ation it has re@@ su@@ m@@ ed a key position in world trade again , which , after the dis@@ co@@ very of A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a , had been d@@ om@@ in@@ ated by the A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ ti@@ c r@@ ou@@ tes .
th@@ an@@ ks also to the new production bo@@ o@@ s@@ t in A@@ si@@ a , Europe now tra@@ d@@ es more with A@@ si@@ a than with A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a .
for these trade r@@ ou@@ tes between A@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ a and A@@ si@@ a , the Mediterranean pro@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ es a v@@ al@@ u@@ able c@@ en@@ t@@ r@@ e for un@@ l@@ o@@ ad@@ ing g@@ o@@ od@@ s for n@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n Europe , which means that c@@ ar@@ ri@@ ers do not have to make d@@ et@@ ou@@ r@@ s .
this is th@@ us a new development which the European Union cannot i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ e and which has already y@@ i@@ el@@ ded the first , a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing results .
and it is towards this in@@ te@@ gra@@ ted , well @-@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ red system that we must en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our to di@@ rec@@ t our funds , a system which is already e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed with transport in@@ ter@@ m@@ od@@ al@@ ity in the form of a@@ ir@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t , ra@@ il@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s and m@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ w@@ a@@ y@@ s .
without this p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al st@@ e@@ p , the funds will f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently not be ex@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ited , as is the case at present .
Mr President , I believe that the great m@@ er@@ it of these reports is that they t@@ one down the op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m of the Commission &apos; s com@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ic@@ ation regarding what it c@@ al@@ l@@ s the progress made since B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a , and that they open the way to a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ous and f@@ a@@ i@@ re@@ r pa@@ th@@ s for the par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p to take .
what were the objectives of that par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p ? they are , once again , the c@@ re@@ ation of an area of peace , the im@@ pro@@ v@@ ement of m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al under@@ st@@ an@@ ding a@@ m@@ on@@ g@@ st the p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es of the region and the c@@ re@@ ation of an area of s@@ ha@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity .
the first two g@@ o@@ als have not been ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ed , as Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r has said .
unfortunately , this is t@@ r@@ u@@ e .
we have not c@@ re@@ ated an area of s@@ ha@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity either , only the very be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ in@@ g@@ s of a free @-@ trade area in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ing some of the countries , e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed on European terms , because the main b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies of these are the in@@ d@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ al products in which we have a com@@ p@@ et@@ it@@ i@@ ve ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge .
I am con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally sur@@ pr@@ ised , mo@@ re@@ over , that those who are the qu@@ ic@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ t to call for an ex@@ t@@ en@@ sion of a free @-@ trade area , im@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ing the li@@ b@@ er@@ al mo@@ de@@ l on terms that are extremely un@@ f@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ ra@@ ble for the countries of the S@@ ou@@ th , are also the first to speak of in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ence , even n@@ e@@ o @-@ c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m , with regard to human rights issues .
in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a , the v@@ it@@ al contribution of civil society to the development of par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ s was rec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ised for the first time in a te@@ x@@ t to which the European Union and 1@@ 5 countries of the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Mediterranean su@@ b@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ ed .
we must ad@@ m@@ it that we have f@@ a@@ il@@ ed s@@ p@@ ec@@ ta@@ c@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly on this issue .
we have been un@@ able to support the d@@ y@@ n@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ c efforts of citizens and d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ ti@@ c projects , in the f@@ ac@@ e of the h@@ ar@@ d line adopted by most governments , but is this from lack of any real will to do so ?
how can we use the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents and the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme to support them ? what s@@ or@@ t of effective strategy and what set of re@@ le@@ v@@ ant measures can we c@@ re@@ ate in order to a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d this s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ o@@ i@@ d situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things ?
do we really wish to re@@ in@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ or@@ ate the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s , or would we rather con@@ d@@ em@@ n ourselves to the Europe of the F@@ i@@ f@@ te@@ en &apos; s con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ing to pu@@ r@@ su@@ e relations in the same tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al m@@ ou@@ l@@ d as some s@@ el@@ f @-@ st@@ y@@ l@@ ed &apos; re@@ al@@ is@@ ti@@ c &apos; st@@ a@@ tes ?
Mr President , the European Union &apos;s policy towards the countries of the Mediterranean is a far c@@ r@@ y from the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s and an even f@@ ar@@ th@@ er c@@ r@@ y from the real needs of the people in these countries .
as Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r ri@@ g@@ h@@ tly said , the European Union only ap@@ p@@ e@@ ar@@ s to be in@@ te@@ re@@ st@@ ed in the Mediterranean for reasons of security and only in@@ ter@@ v@@ en@@ es ec@@ on@@ om@@ ic@@ ally in order to g@@ a@@ in a f@@ o@@ o@@ th@@ ol@@ d on the mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n countries .
the new common strategy g@@ o@@ es even further in the same di@@ rec@@ tion ; it even t@@ ri@@ es to in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve the Mediterranean countries in the ag@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve C@@ F@@ S@@ P .
e@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation is the main v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le for in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ence in the internal a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s of the Mediterranean countries , and , o@@ st@@ en@@ si@@ b@@ ly , all this is being done in the n@@ a@@ me of common pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity , democracy , the r@@ u@@ le of law and human rights .
at the same time , the European Union re@@ ma@@ in@@ s res@@ ol@@ u@@ te@@ ly in@@ different to the tra@@ g@@ ed@@ y of the P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an people and the m@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ er of P@@ al@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans by the state of I@@ s@@ ra@@ e@@ l on a d@@ a@@ il@@ y basis .
the C@@ om@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ is@@ t Party of G@@ re@@ ec@@ e de@@ f@@ en@@ ds c@@ ol@@ la@@ b@@ or@@ ation between people on e@@ qu@@ al terms and without one country &apos;s in@@ ter@@ f@@ er@@ ing in the internal a@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ ir@@ s of another .
in particular , we would point out that it is the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed c@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ t countries which are responsible for the current state of the under@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries .
that is yet another reason why the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries are d@@ u@@ ty b@@ ou@@ n@@ d to help these countries de@@ v@@ el@@ o@@ p their pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tive b@@ a@@ se and ra@@ ise the st@@ an@@ d@@ ar@@ d of li@@ v@@ ing of their in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I certainly g@@ re@@ at@@ ly w@@ el@@ com@@ ed Mr N@@ a@@ ï@@ r &apos;s report , which does not con@@ ta@@ in any f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic@@ ation but g@@ i@@ v@@ es an un@@ b@@ i@@ a@@ se@@ d d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ tion of a problem which needs to be res@@ ol@@ v@@ ed , first and f@@ o@@ re@@ most at political level , and also Mrs M@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ ar@@ d@@ in@@ i &apos;s report , which is in @-@ de@@ p@@ th and g@@ i@@ v@@ es just as t@@ r@@ u@@ e a p@@ ic@@ ture .
it is , of course , no longer necessary to re@@ mind the House of the role , the f@@ un@@ c@@ tion and the importance of the Mediterranean in the very or@@ i@@ g@@ in@@ s of European c@@ ul@@ ture and the way that it is both the c@@ ra@@ d@@ le and the v@@ e@@ h@@ ic@@ le of our c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ is@@ ation .
however , we cannot i@@ g@@ n@@ or@@ e the fact that , th@@ us far , our j@@ o@@ in@@ t action in this major g@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h@@ ical area has not been effective and has certainly not been ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ ve .
p@@ o@@ or@@ ly man@@ ag@@ ed programmes , m@@ al@@ ad@@ min@@ is@@ t@@ ra@@ tion , even a certain lack of clear th@@ in@@ king and political ti@@ m@@ el@@ in@@ e@@ s@@ s have pre@@ v@@ en@@ ted us from making what is - I am sure - the will of our institutions a p@@ ra@@ c@@ ti@@ c@@ al re@@ al@@ ity , that is from ac@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ing the three objectives f@@ o@@ c@@ used on at B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a : an area of peace and st@@ ability , an area of s@@ ha@@ red pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity through free trade and greater under@@ st@@ an@@ ding between p@@ e@@ op@@ l@@ es .
as a Member of the Committee on B@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s , I can only hope that the Commission will be w@@ il@@ l@@ ing to change the way it r@@ un@@ s the M@@ E@@ D@@ A programme and the very st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ture of the programme , in the m@@ an@@ n@@ er in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated by Mr B@@ ou@@ r@@ l@@ an@@ g@@ es , that is , b@@ as@@ ing its approach on ra@@ d@@ ical st@@ re@@ a@@ m@@ l@@ in@@ ing of the c@@ y@@ c@@ le of procedures , greater rec@@ ou@@ r@@ se to ma@@ c@@ ro@@ financial support , and less com@@ p@@ le@@ x com@@ m@@ it@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y .
the Commission , which is already p@@ res@@ ent@@ ing the in@@ it@@ i@@ al d@@ ra@@ f@@ t b@@ u@@ d@@ get , also needs to en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ our to be more trans@@ par@@ ent by pro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing an an@@ n@@ u@@ al d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ ment h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ting the ex@@ pen@@ d@@ it@@ ur@@ e com@@ m@@ it@@ ments which can be made for each country .
this is an area we must ta@@ c@@ k@@ le if we g@@ en@@ u@@ in@@ el@@ y want to implement our policy .
Mr President , the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s is a s@@ pl@@ en@@ did idea , only st@@ r@@ ic@@ tly s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king it is 2000 years over@@ due .
a system based on par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ sh@@ i@@ p with the same rights and ob@@ li@@ g@@ ations is su@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ sed to em@@ er@@ ge from a c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al and a p@@ o@@ s@@ t @-@ c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al system .
seen from a h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ ical per@@ s@@ p@@ ec@@ tive , the r@@ ul@@ ing st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ u@@ res were always con@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ ted in such a way as to pro@@ d@@ u@@ ce a North @-@ S@@ ou@@ th di@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ e , and now it is only right that Europe , w@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e countries - or rather , certain European States from within this system - were al@@ most always the b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ ar@@ ies , should also take responsibility for ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement and par@@ ity , and should promote these aspects too .
the g@@ o@@ al of the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s is un@@ dis@@ pu@@ ted .
its su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s de@@ pen@@ ds not only on for@@ ma@@ l n@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ti@@ ated ou@@ t@@ comes , but also on the ex@@ t@@ ent to which we are able to dis@@ p@@ e@@ l the pre@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ ic@@ es we ourselves h@@ ar@@ b@@ our towards the Mediterranean States and their in@@ ha@@ b@@ it@@ an@@ ts .
there can be no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t that the re@@ al@@ is@@ ation of the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a objectives will pro@@ ve dec@@ is@@ i@@ ve to a peace strategy of the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y .
e@@ qu@@ ally , it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is ex@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ ded .
L@@ i@@ b@@ y@@ a , the country that li@@ es al@@ most ex@@ ac@@ tly at the he@@ ar@@ t of the Mediterranean States , g@@ o@@ es un@@ mentioned in the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a pa@@ per .
the process of ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement will not work un@@ less the EU en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ ou@@ r@@ s to in@@ v@@ ite L@@ i@@ b@@ y@@ a to take part in it .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are all f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ i@@ a@@ r with the c@@ at@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e of problems a@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ting the E@@ ur@@ o @-@ Mediterranean region and their c@@ a@@ u@@ ses : they are b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally the same as in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 when the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s was la@@ un@@ ch@@ ed .
they have already been mentioned in the debate : from il@@ legal im@@ m@@ i@@ gra@@ tion to d@@ r@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ ts , from external de@@ b@@ t to the f@@ a@@ il@@ ur@@ e to respect human rights , and ter@@ r@@ or@@ is@@ m , which r@@ u@@ th@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ly d@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ s the li@@ v@@ es of in@@ no@@ c@@ ent human be@@ in@@ g@@ s and f@@ a@@ m@@ il@@ ies , as we are se@@ e@@ ing in S@@ pa@@ in , in A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a and in the M@@ i@@ d@@ d@@ le E@@ a@@ st itself .
today more than ever we must make the st@@ a@@ te@@ ment that only cooperation , dialogue , economic and cultural ex@@ ch@@ an@@ g@@ es , s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al under@@ st@@ an@@ ding can t@@ u@@ r@@ n the two si@@ d@@ es of the Mediterranean into a pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous and p@@ e@@ ac@@ e@@ ful area .
n@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ er the European Union n@@ or the M@@ ag@@ h@@ re@@ b or M@@ a@@ sh@@ re@@ q countries can a@@ f@@ for@@ d not to take ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of the human and cultural resources that en@@ r@@ ic@@ h the region .
the problem is that we are not doing that pro@@ per@@ ly .
the as@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation ag@@ re@@ em@@ ents are de@@ a@@ d le@@ t@@ ters in many res@@ p@@ ec@@ ts .
the financial in@@ st@@ r@@ u@@ ments are not being used as they should and the political , economic and social development of those countries is not k@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ing up with the pa@@ ce of h@@ or@@ i@@ z@@ on@@ ta@@ l cooperation , which is very necessary , n@@ or with the m@@ od@@ er@@ n@@ ity re@@ qu@@ i@@ red today by a world which , te@@ ch@@ n@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ic@@ ally s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ king , is taking g@@ i@@ ant st@@ e@@ p@@ s forward .
it is time to mo@@ ve from con@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ la@@ tion to action , to d@@ em@@ and per@@ for@@ man@@ ce and e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ en@@ e@@ s@@ s in the efforts to implement the strategy which has been d@@ ra@@ w@@ n up and , in this respect , I would like to em@@ p@@ ha@@ s@@ is@@ e the d@@ em@@ and for human resources to be st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ en@@ ed , as in@@ d@@ ic@@ ated by Mr G@@ al@@ e@@ o@@ t@@ e .
Mr President , today we are de@@ b@@ ating two reports which are political reports pa@@ r ex@@ c@@ el@@ l@@ ence and with which I fully con@@ c@@ u@@ r .
that being the case , in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of el@@ ab@@ or@@ ating on these two reports , I should like to say a few words to cor@@ ro@@ b@@ or@@ ate the ar@@ gu@@ ments be@@ h@@ in@@ d them .
a few m@@ on@@ th@@ s ago , we had a en@@ ti@@ r@@ e debate because the President of the Commission , Mr P@@ ro@@ d@@ i , said that European h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y d@@ a@@ tes from the time of C@@ h@@ ar@@ le@@ ma@@ g@@ n@@ e .
the very n@@ a@@ me Europe which , as E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans , we all be@@ a@@ r , d@@ er@@ i@@ v@@ es from the n@@ a@@ me E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ a , the d@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ter of L@@ i@@ b@@ y@@ a and P@@ o@@ se@@ i@@ d@@ on , the G@@ o@@ d of the S@@ e@@ a .
E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ a was Z@@ e@@ us &apos;s w@@ i@@ f@@ e , the mo@@ th@@ er of M@@ in@@ o@@ s , S@@ ar@@ p@@ ed@@ on and R@@ ad@@ a@@ m@@ an@@ the .
why am I te@@ l@@ ling you all this ?
because m@@ y@@ th@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y itself , which is a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive rec@@ or@@ d of h@@ is@@ t@@ or@@ y , h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ ts the relations which ex@@ is@@ t between Europe and North A@@ f@@ r@@ ic@@ a .
the Mediterranean is , to all in@@ t@@ ents and pu@@ r@@ p@@ o@@ ses , the only European se@@ a , and as long as we , in our pl@@ ans and policies , look down on the other si@@ d@@ e of the Mediterranean from on high , then we shall get no@@ where .
we need to get a few things st@@ ra@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t .
if , in the t@@ w@@ ent@@ y @-@ first c@@ en@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ y , we t@@ r@@ y and b@@ a@@ se policies on the at@@ te@@ m@@ p@@ t by certain European countries to find tra@@ c@@ es of the recent c@@ ol@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m to le@@ an on then , p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ ally , Europe will get no@@ where .
we must re@@ al@@ ise that the st@@ ar@@ ting point for today &apos;s debate , based on the two reports , based on the decisions taken in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a , is to see the other si@@ d@@ e of the Mediterranean as part of Europe .
the European Union itself must take initiatives - development , cultural and , most im@@ por@@ t@@ an@@ tly , peace initiatives - so that the two si@@ d@@ es of Europe can st@@ and op@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ ite each other without our again he@@ ar@@ ing ec@@ h@@ o@@ es of &quot; H@@ an@@ n@@ i@@ b@@ al an@@ te por@@ ta@@ s &quot; or &quot; D@@ el@@ en@@ d@@ a est C@@ ar@@ th@@ ago &quot; or a m@@ od@@ er@@ n ver@@ sion of S@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ o .
there are E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e@@ ans on the other si@@ d@@ e of the Mediterranean and we would do well to re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er that .
Mr President , the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s was not la@@ c@@ king in good in@@ t@@ en@@ tions or financial resources .
despite this , the ou@@ t@@ come was m@@ e@@ ag@@ r@@ e , which is very dis@@ ap@@ p@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ing .
there was too much g@@ e@@ st@@ ur@@ e p@@ ol@@ it@@ ic@@ s going on and too little c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out the pl@@ ans .
three qu@@ ar@@ ters of the com@@ m@@ it@@ ted funding n@@ e@@ v@@ er le@@ f@@ t the k@@ it@@ t@@ y .
in@@ st@@ e@@ a@@ d of a re@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tion in the means , this will now le@@ a@@ d to an increase , which is a little b@@ i@@ z@@ ar@@ r@@ e , to say the least .
it makes no s@@ en@@ se to b@@ u@@ d@@ get for even h@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ er a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts if the ab@@ s@@ or@@ p@@ tion c@@ a@@ pa@@ c@@ ity re@@ ma@@ in@@ s re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted and the Commission d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ations are under@@ st@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ed .
it would be far more pre@@ f@@ er@@ able if the European Union were to s@@ how its s@@ ol@@ i@@ d@@ ar@@ ity with the Mediterranean countries by op@@ en@@ ing up its mar@@ k@@ e@@ ts more , not only for products from industry , but also for those from ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ ture and h@@ or@@ ti@@ c@@ ul@@ ture .
we have a very long way to go before a free @-@ trade area is e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
the ec@@ on@@ om@@ ies of the par@@ t@@ n@@ er countries are still very v@@ ul@@ n@@ er@@ able .
their m@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ al trade is still being re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ ted and has pro@@ te@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ is@@ m w@@ r@@ it@@ t@@ en all over it .
A@@ d@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally , the political d@@ is@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ st which ex@@ is@@ t@@ s between the par@@ t@@ n@@ ers must first be dis@@ p@@ el@@ l@@ ed .
the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s can only su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed if the Mediterranean par@@ t@@ n@@ ers continue to work on d@@ em@@ o@@ c@@ ra@@ t@@ is@@ ation .
the human rights c@@ la@@ u@@ se@@ s in the A@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ation A@@ g@@ re@@ em@@ ents should not re@@ main h@@ ol@@ l@@ o@@ w p@@ h@@ ra@@ ses .
any v@@ i@@ ol@@ ations should be pen@@ al@@ is@@ ed by a d@@ ro@@ p in financial support .
but if we re@@ d@@ u@@ ce the a@@ m@@ ou@@ n@@ ts which cannot be s@@ p@@ ent an@@ y@@ way , then this will not make any impact w@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever .
we must bring our a@@ m@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ ons into line with the de@@ g@@ re@@ e to which they can be im@@ pl@@ em@@ en@@ ted .
the question is whether the report &apos; s many s@@ ou@@ n@@ d w@@ is@@ h@@ es can all be re@@ al@@ is@@ ed at the same time .
it is better to do one th@@ ing which is s@@ li@@ g@@ h@@ tly in@@ f@@ er@@ i@@ or than to do a great deal of things which are d@@ o@@ w@@ n@@ right in@@ f@@ er@@ i@@ or .
fin@@ e words and fin@@ e b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ et@@ s are not enough to guarantee st@@ ability and w@@ el@@ f@@ are .
it is about the w@@ il@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ness to c@@ ar@@ r@@ y out t@@ r@@ u@@ e political reform , and this is what the B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a P@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s still la@@ c@@ ks .
Mr President , the Mediterranean is the c@@ ra@@ d@@ le of European c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ is@@ ation .
the le@@ g@@ ac@@ y of an@@ c@@ i@@ ent E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t , G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and R@@ om@@ e s@@ ha@@ p@@ ed our c@@ ul@@ ture , our l@@ it@@ er@@ a@@ ture , our very under@@ st@@ an@@ ding of the common European heritage .
ar@@ ou@@ n@@ d the Mediterranean the three m@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ e@@ is@@ ti@@ c re@@ li@@ g@@ i@@ ons - J@@ u@@ d@@ a@@ is@@ m , C@@ h@@ r@@ is@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ s@@ la@@ m - were f@@ ou@@ n@@ ded and f@@ o@@ st@@ e@@ red and s@@ pre@@ a@@ d throughout the k@@ no@@ w@@ n world .
