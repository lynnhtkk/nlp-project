possible aid## s could be national Lisbon plan## s , a number of structural indic## ators , involv## ing national parliament## s in monitor## ing and assess## ing the process and certain## ly also a class## ification of the Member State## s accord## ing to perform## ance . 
in add## ition , we would also urge you to ensu## re that the es## s## ence of the St## ability and G## row## th Pact remain## s in## tact . 
that is some## thing about which a number of Member## s have had a lot to say . 
final## ly , we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in service## s , but in the right way , that is , with the support of the public and of civil soci## ety . 
we are also expect## ing propos## al## s aim## ed at im## prov## ing the invest## ment climate , including for the medium @## -## @ s## ized and small enter## prise## s that are s## till the driv## ing force of our economic grow## th . 
we all know that with## out any grow## th , there are no job## s , and with## out any job## s , there is no bas## is for social securit## y , which we are all ver## y keen to see protect## ed . 
Mr President , you have an ard## uous task , all the more s## o be## cause the Constitution ha## s not y## et be## en approve## d and the financial perspective## s are as y## et un## known . 
we are , in fact , ask## ing you to serve up a men## u with## out having a kitchen to prepar## e it and with## out know## ing what budget is avail## able . 
how## ever , we are count## ing on your creat## ivity and on a good team spirit a## mong your people . 
if , in Janu## ary , you propos## e solid policy and dish up a consist## ent meal , you will have a last## ing ally in the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I have listen## ed to e## ach and every one of you most attentive## ly . 
I thank you for your contribut## ions , which reflect a wide varie## ty of view## s in this Parliament . 
I also eager## ly await the result of your vot## e next Thursday . 
the re## solution that is th## en adopt## ed will certain## ly be ver## y import## ant for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union . 
at this time I think I might al## read## y draw three provision## al conclusion## s . 
first , I note that the great major## ity of speaker## s agree with the need to define priorit## ies that correspond to the public &apos;## s expect## ations and think it import## ant that the European Union and it## s institution## s should respond to the prim## ary concern## s of European citizen## s . 
second## ly , the great major## ity of speaker## s ident## ified three basic area## s for action : the area we can call Lisbon , the Lisbon strate## gy ( economic reform with a social and environment## al dimension ) ; the area## s connect## ed with securit## y and justice ; and Europe &apos;## s role in the world . 
t## hirdly , I also see that there is broad con## sensus on the need for a pro## active cohes## ion policy , a tru## e solid## arity policy in Europe . 
I particular## ly hope that the Member State## s &quot; Govern## ments have take## n care## ful note of this . 
accord## ing## ly , I feel that we can conclude that there is con## sensus regard## ing Europe &apos;## s need for grow## th and employ## ment . 
with## out grow## th , with## out job creation and with## out great## er dynam## ism in our econom## y , we s## hall be un## able to maintain the high level## s of social protection and the exact## ing environment## al standard## s that we regard as part of what is normal## ly call## ed the European model . 
what is at s## take is not , and n## ever ha## s be## en , the destruct## ion of the European model . 
what is tru## ly at s## take is the need to adapt and to modernise this European model , and to take account of a number of new challenge## s that are now making them## selves felt a## cross Europe and the world . 
the increas## ing age of our population , the effect## s of global## isation - all this require## s Europe to adapt and change with## in this more competitive con## text . 
I am pleas## ed to say that I do not believ## e that concern## s for economic efficiency and concern## s for social justice are mutual## ly in## compatible . 
these object## ive## s - great## er competitive## ness a## long## side sustain## able development and social concern - can## not in any way be in## compatible . 
we have to work to make them compatible . 
these are object## ive## s that define one of our priorit## ies . 
I there## fore believ## e we must work to## ward## s achiev## ing the broad## est possible con## sensus , but a dynamic con## sensus and one that is not the result of cancel## ling out op## posing point## s of view , be## cause we also have to recognis## e that there are some contradict## ory priorit## ies here in Parliament . 
accord## ing## ly , we have to ident## ify the high## est common denominator for a dynamic con## sensus . 
I think that one con## sensus that ha## s clear## ly emerge## d is the need to strength## en our solid## arity at this time when we have an enlarge## d Europe . 
we have a Europe in the process of re## un## ification . 
our enlarge## ment is an enlarge## ment that ha## s on## ly just beg## un . 
we have sign## ed the treat## ies and have ten new Member State## s a## mong us , but we have to do all we can s## o that we can s## oon stop talk## ing about old and new Member State## s and become a real Union , and for that we need an active cohes## ion policy . 
that is why I keep return## ing to the idea of a plan of value## s , and solid## arity is certain## ly a value that can un## ite us . 
that is why I say that now , when I see the issue of European ident## ity be## ing debate## d s## o often in Europe , I have to stress that it is root## ed in respect for our vari## ous national , regional and local ident## ities . 
European divers## ity is what tru## ly define## s our ident## ity and , if we want to define ident## ity , we must define it in term## s of the value## s enshrine## d in the European Constitution and the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , that is , respect for the dign## ity of the human be## ing , for human right## s , for justice , for the rule of law and for the principle## s of free## dom and equal## ity . 
these are the value## s that define our ident## ity . 
respect for the principle of non @## -## @ discrimin## ation and tolerance to## ward## s any## one who come## s in through our border## s . 
it is there## fore on the bas## is of these value## s that we can promot## e the idea of Europe a## round the world . 
I s## aid in my first speech that it is on the bas## is of these value## s that we can best look after our interest## s . 
we are look## ing after our interest## s with a more ambitious neighbour## hood policy : a policy for our East## ern or Medi## terranean neighbour## s that promot## es st## ability and peace , as we have be## en do## ing in Ukraine , for ex## ample . 
I should like to under## line some## thing that ha## s not al## ways be## en put in## to word## s . 
the signal## s that the European Union ha## s s## ent out d## uring the current cris## is in Ukraine have be## en high## ly posit## ive . 
with## out any competit## ion for the lime## light , we have had the Council Presidency , the European Council , the European Commission and some Member State## s all involve## d in seek## ing a peace## ful , democratic solution for Ukraine . 
that reflect## s ver## y well on our Europe . 
we must also , how## ever , have a gener## ous development policy . 
as I have al## read## y s## aid , Europe can## not be selfish . 
the policy must reflect external## ly what we now do internal## ly , having over## come a great man## y historical conflict## s by mean## s of collabo## ration between Member State## s that we## re ver## y often at war with e## ach other in the past . 
that is why I believ## e we have the du## ty to advoc## ate effective multilateral## ism , where## by we work on a plat## form of equal## ity and respect with our principal partner## s , we seek to revitalise the trans## atlantic alli## ance , and un## ite all our partner## s a## round value## s s## uch as free## dom , peace and demo## cracy . 
that is how Europe progress## es - by enrich## ing it## s heritage , by build## ing and renew## ing a dynamic con## sensus and by seek## ing to show the world th## ose qual## ities that make it s## o different . 
I should like to finish , lad## ies and gentle## men , by assuring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliament &apos;## s position## s , s## o as to in## corporate th## ose position## s in## to what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or an## other , but a strategic vision for all European institution## s and for the European Union as a whole through## out the next f## ive year## s . 
at the conclusion of this debate , I have receiv## ed six motion## s for re## solution## s table## d in accord## ance with Rule 1## 03 of the Rule## s of Procedure . ( 1 ) 
the vot## e will take place on Thursday . 
the debate is closed . 
we s## hall proceed to the formal s## itt## ing for the a## ward of the Sakharov Prize to the Associ## ation of Journal## ists of Belarus . 
it is a great honour and pleas## ure for me to welcome the winner## s of the Sakharov Prize 20## 04 , a prize which the European Parliament is a## ward## ing to the Associ## ation of Journal## ists of Belarus , head## ed by it## s President , Mr## s Z## han## na Lit## vin## a . 
I would like to welcome you in your language : , Mr## s Lit## vin## a . 
I must inform Parliament that the represent## ative## s of the Associ## ation of Journal## ists of Belarus include S## vet## lan## a Zavad## s## kaya , who## s## e husband ha## s be## en mis## s## ing since Ju## ly 20## 00 . 
we wish to express our sympath## y and solid## arity with Mr## s Zavad## s## kaya and her fami## ly at this ver## y difficult time . 
this prize recognis## es a group of professional## s who risk the## ir live## s on a dai## ly bas## is to seek out the truth and communic## ate it to the## ir citizen## s . 
in 20## 04 , more th## an 50 journal## ists have be## en murder## ed through## out the world , together with 14 media assist## ants . 
a## round 200 have be## en imprison## ed and we should re## member that two French journal## ists have be## en held in Iraq for more th## an 1## 00 days now . 
20## 04 ha## s not be## en Belarus &apos;## s best year . 
the pressure from the author## ities on the in## dependent media ha## s increas## ed consider## ably . 
the State ha## s continu## ed to silence critical voice## s , im## posing fine## s , system## atic## ally suspend## ing and closing news## paper## s , harass## ing journal## ists and taking criminal action again## st them . 
free## dom is what soci## ety ha## s the right to do and know and what the State does not have the right to hinder . 
in Belarus , how## ever , it is hinder## ed . 
with## in Belarus &apos;## s dictator## ial system , the result of elect## ions not recognis## ed by the international communit## y , access to inform## ation not filter## ed by the author## ities involve## s risk , and the Associ## ation of Journal## ists of Belarus and it## s one thousand member## s , be## ing a## ward## ed this prize today , run that risk every day . 
having suffer## ed vari## ous method## s of tradition## al censor## ship , the Associ## ation manage## s , courage## ously , to broadcast it## s inform## ation via the Inter## net . 
but the author## ities continu## e to pursu## e you and , n## ever## the## less , you continu## e to try to keep the public aware of the right to free## dom of express## ion and the need to exerc## ise it . 
the attack## s suffer## ed by your Associ## ation are attack## s again## st fundamental human right## s , which are enshrine## d in the Char## ter of Right## s and in the draft European Constitution . 
Madam President , I would like to inform you that we in the European Parliament have decide## d that our Deleg## ation for Rel## ations with Belarus will not maintain relation## s with the author## ities of the regime , and will on## ly maintain them and promot## e them with the N## GO## s and with civil soci## ety . 
we are all sadden## ed and frust## rated to note that , 15 year## s after the fall of the Berlin Wall , vestige## s of that artificial division of Europe s## till remain . 
we are frust## rated to know that in Belarus the death penal## ty is s## till in force , and it is the on## ly country in this continent which s## till appli## es it . 
the prize we are a## ward## ing today remind## s us that there are border## s with## in Europe which restrict the application of our value## s . 
final## ly , lad## ies and gentle## men , I would like to remind you that our Parliament usual## ly stay## s in contact with pre## vi## ous winner## s of the Sakharov prize and that this month it will be 14 year## s since we a## ward## ed this prize to A## un## g San Su## u Kyi , who is s## till under arrest in M## yan## mar , and who## s## e im## mediate re## lease we continu## e to demand . 
Madam President , per## hap## s I should make it absolut## e## ly clear that , when you have return## ed to your country , we will continu## e to support you through all of our resource## s and we call on the Belarus## ian author## ities to respect your right## s and free## dom## s . 
I would like to congratul## ate you on the work you are do## ing in Belarus## ian : , Mr## s Lit## vin## a . 
you have the floor . 
( 1 ) Mr President , Member## s of the European Parliament , Lad## ies and Gentle## men , this is a ver## y emotional moment for me , be## cause this is an extreme## ly import## ant , significant moment for my colleague## s and I## . The fact that we are receiv## ing this prize as an organisation is a sign of solid## arity and support for the entire Belarus## ian democratic move## ment and support for the political force## s that will final## ly ensu## re that in futur## e there will be a link between Belarus and the European Union . 
the fact that this prize was initial## ly put forward for two Belarus## ian organisation## s - the second organisation was the youth organisation Z## U## B## R - is prob## ably a sign that Belarus is the focus of international attention and that my country , which one of my colleague## s ha## s describ## ed as a ches## s piece which ha## s fall## en off the ches## s board , will o## nce again become an in## dependent ent## ity in European politic## s and will one day take a worthy place a## mong the other nation## s a## round the European table . 
the prize is s## uch an import## ant signal for us be## cause we understand our problem## s , but the## y are not just a matter of uphold## ing our own professional principle## s . 
it is also about defend## ing the right## s of all our citizen## s to receiv## e object## ive , un## censor## ed inform## ation . 
it is extreme## ly import## ant that our problem## s are under## stood by you and by European politic## ians . 
un## fortunate## ly , the Belarus## ian author## ities have manage## d to creat## e a closed soci## ety built on isol## ation and disdain for democratic value## s . 
the## y protect the## ir st## ability and surviv## al by mean## s of total control over the flow of inform## ation . 
the electro## nic media are al## most total## ly monopol## ised by the author## ities . 
the situ## ation is wor## s## e be## cause the work of these monopol## ised media is direct## ed at discredit## ing any political advers## aries , and the monopol## ised media try to reinforce stereo## type## s and myth## s . 
one s## uch wide## spread myth in Belarus is that no## body in Europe is watch## ing us , no## body expect## s us to join them and Europe is hostil## e and aggress## ive to## ward## s us , the on## ly guarantee of st## ability in our country is the head of state , and s## o on and s## o forth . 
de## spite our constitutional provision## s , there is on## ly one oblig## atory ide## ology that prevail## s in Belarus now . 
in Belarus a process ha## s now be## en complete## d - the creation of a new state structure which is known as the ideo## logical &apos; vertical &apos; . 
there is total in## tolerance of critic## ism and we are not allow## ed to object or express our view## s . 
my colleague## s know that we are subject to use of the criminal code again## st us if we criticise the President . 
two year## s ago , Pav## al Maz## he## ika , a young journal## ist , was give## n a prison sentenc## e under the criminal code . 
d## uring political campaign## s there is even more pressure on the non @## -## @ state press ; the refer## endum and the re## cent parliament## ary elect## ions are a case in point . 
on the e## ve of the refer## endum my colleague , E## lena Ra## v## bet## s## kaya , the editor of the news## paper publish## ed an article in which s## he s## aid that call## ing the refer## endum was &apos; a challenge to soci## ety &apos; and that to carry it out require## d a total lack of con## science and total neglect of public opinion . 
my colleague was also tri## ed and fin## ed as a result . 
her news## paper ha## s also be## en punish## ed and ha## s be## en closed down for three month## s as a result of that article . 
again , two week## s ago , a ver## y well @## -## @ known person , Gar## ry Pa## han## ia## y## la , V## ice @## -## @ President of the Belarus Hel## s## ink## i Committee , was also sentenc## ed for slander again## st the state . 
the reason for this was a cassette tap## ed by a Swe## dish tele## vision journal## ist , which was confisc## ated from him at the border . 
Mr Pa## han## ia## y## la had give## n an interview and mention## ed the name## s of th## ose suspect## ed of involve## ment in the dis## appearance of Belarus## ian op## position politic## ians . 
that was sufficient for them to bring him to trial and he may well be imprison## ed for f## ive year## s as a result . 
we are ver## y concern## ed that , de## spite the conclusion## s reach## ed in the report on the dis## appearance## s of Belarus## ian politic## ians and journal## ists by Christ## os P## our## gu## rides , a Council of Europe special rapporteur , and de## spite the international communit## y &apos;## s close attention to this subject , it seem## s that the Belarus## ian author## ities are s## till not interest## ed in a full in @## -## @ depth investig## ation of these dis## appearance## s or in publish## ing s## uch an investig## ation . 
we s## till do not know what happen## ed to D## mi## try Zavad## sky , who dis## appear## ed four year## s ago . 
he is a journal## ist and a member of our organisation and the author## ities have n## ever told us what happen## ed to him . 
hi## s wife , S## vet## lan## a Zavad## s## kaya , is on our delegation . 
the issue of the dis## appear## ed is s## till in the news## paper## s . 
three year## s ago , d## uring the p## resident## ial elect## ion campaign , we we## re punish## ed for mention## ing this . 
there was direct censor## ship . 
at the begin## ning of this year , in the last campaign for parliament## ary elect## ions and the refer## endum , we saw for the first time the summa## ry closure of news## paper## s at the be## h## est of the Mini## s## try of In## formation . there we## re 19 case## s of suspens## ion of the activities of in## dependent media out## lets . 
our colleague , And## re## y Shan## tar## ovich , actual## ly w## ent on hung## er strike as a result of hi## s paper be## ing shut down . 
after the hung## er strike he was charge## d with carry## ing out an un## author## ised protest . 
this was absurd . 
the inform## ation about hi## s hung## er strike had be## en publish## ed all a## round the city and , as a result , he was fin## ed for the hung## er strike . 
suspend## ing the activities of news## paper## s is aim## ed first## ly at hit## ting the news## paper## s economic## ally . 
economic discrimin## ation ha## s become one of the ways of restrict## ing the activities of the in## dependent press . 
my colleague## s in the press are coming up again## st major obstacle## s in the distribut## ion of the## ir news## paper## s . 
the distribut## ion of alter## native , accurate inform## ation to citizen## s is one of the major problem## s fac## ing our soci## ety . 
if a public## ation criticise## s the author## ities , this auto## matic## ally lead## s to problem## s with the print## ing house## s . 
accord## ing to the Mini## s## try of In## formation , there are hundred## s of in## dependent print## ing press## es , but al## read## y f## ive in## dependent public## ations can no long## er be print## ed in our country ; the## y have to be print## ed in S## mole## ns## k in Russia be## cause the## y can## not use print## ing press## es on Belarus## ian ter## rit## ory . 
I can say quit## e categor## ical## ly that the journal## ists - my colleague## s from the in## dependent press - remain tru## e to the principle## s of the## ir profess## ion . 
the in## dependent press , which s## till appear## s in Belarus , is vi## rtual## ly the on## ly institution which exerc## ises any scrutin## y over the state and it is the on## ly source of free inform## ation to citizen## s . 
it would not be possible for us to surviv## e with## out the collect## ive support of international and European organisation## s . 
I would like to take this opportun## ity to pay trib## ute to Article 19 ; to the Inter## national Fede## ration of Journal## ists ; Report## ers with## out B## order## s ; the Inter## national League for Human Right## s ; the Dan## ish organisation## s ; the Hel## s## ink## i Committee from Swede## n and Nor## way ; the Centre of Ex## t## reme Journal## ism , as it is call## ed - a Russia## n organisation ; and the G## las## nost De## fence Found## ation . 
all these are partner organisation## s that are help## ing us , and our strength lies in this partner## ship and co## operation . 
it is ver## y import## ant for us that European soci## ety and the European institution## s should not weaken the## ir position with regard to the principle## s of free## dom of speech and human right## s . 
if there we## re to be any weaken## ing of th## ose position## s , th## en the repress## ive machine with## in Belarus would start to go in## to over## drive and we would feel even more pressure again## st us . 
re## cent## ly , at international level , man## y politic## ians from eastern European countries have express## ed the## ir concern## s about the situ## ation in Belarus and are prepar## ed to work to## ward## s formula## ting a strate## gy to## ward## s Belarus at European level . 
I would like to express our support for that and the certain## ty that a common European strate## gy to## ward## s Belarus will emerge and will ver## y much help our situ## ation . 
we can on## ly combat a total## itarian regime by creat## ing an open inform## ation soci## ety ; a soci## ety that would encourag## e debate ; a for## um - which is a place for people to receiv## e accurate inform## ation . 
we have a comprehens## ive programme which we feel will help to un## lock the situ## ation in our country . 
we are prepar## ed to discuss that with you . 
I will just mention a few of the priorit## ies . 
we need support for what is legal and what is s## till work## ing in Belarus . 
basic## ally , what I am refer## ring to is the in## dependent press and the non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s that are s## till oper## ating in our country . 
what is also ver## y import## ant for us is the effect of the strength## ened pre## s## ence of the European Union in Belarus - some## thing that we would encourag## e . 
per## hap## s there is some way of establish## ing a European Union special represent## ative for Belarus . 
we feel it is ver## y import## ant that our people should receiv## e a mess## age from the European Union . it## s value would be that our return to Europe depend## s on us , the Belarus## ian people . 
we understand that today , Belarus &apos;## s visit## ing card un## fortunate## ly im## plies the Luka## s## henko regime . 
in fact there are ten million people in our country and at least half of th## ose associate the futur## e of our country with a return to Europe . 
I should like to take this opportun## ity to urge the Member## s of the European Parliament - e## special## ly the member## s of the delegation to Belarus - to support our propos## al## s with regard to stag## ing hear## ing## s on the media situ## ation in Belarus . 
s## uch hear## ing## s might lead to re## commend## ations on bring## ing our legisl## ation in## to line with European standard## s and would help us to de## monopol## ise the mass media . 
o## nce again , I thank you for this a## ward . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , the formal s## itt## ing is closed . 
Mr President , pursu## ant to Rule 1## 66 of the Rule## s of Procedure of the European Parliament , I should like to enquir## e on what legal bas## is the mini## ature national flag## s we## re re## mov## ed from the seat## s occupied by Pol## ish Member## s from the League of Pol## ish Fami## lies ? 
is there any legal bas## is for re## mov## ing some## one else &apos;## s proper## ty , and on who## s## e order## s we## re the flag## s re## mov## ed ? 
we insist the## y be return## ed im## mediate## ly . 
as far as we are concern## ed , the## y are ho## ly . 
in add## ition , I fail to see how the## y could be detriment## al to the European Parliament . 
this is an import## ant issue , lad## ies and gentle## men . 
as you will be aware , we do follow the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s in absolut## e## ly defend## ing the right to proper## ty . 
this morning , the House &apos;## s service## s we## re inform## ed that a number of flag## s that had be## en in this Chamber we## re no long## er there . 
even after pain## s## taking investig## ations , it ha## s not be## en possible to determine who re## mov## ed them and where the## y are now . 
I would ask the indulg## ence of the Pol## ish and other Member## s . 
we will continu## e our investig## ations and hope that the flag## s will turn up some## where , but , for the moment , the## y have simpl## y dis## appear## ed . 
I must , how## ever , point out , lad## ies and gentle## men , that it ha## s not hither## to be## en good practice in this House for individual delegation## s to use flag## s to mark where the## y s## it . 
let me further point out to you that the Bur## eau , at the re## quest of one of the V## ice @## -## @ President## s , consider## ed this issue yesterday and that this issue of flag## s is on the age## nda for the next meet## ing of the Bur## eau , which will deal with the matter . 
we s## hall now proceed to the vot## e . 
. 
Mr President , in accord## ance with the Rule## s , I had ask## ed to make a comment about this report , and I am s## or## ry I was not call## ed be## fore the vot## e . 
I rise not be## cause this is a controversial report for this Parliament - on the contr## ary , the Committee on Eco## nomic and Mon## et## ary Affair## s adopt## ed it overwhelm## ing## ly ; and I am glad that Parliament ha## s done s## o too , be## cause it is about fair## ness and ens## uring equal## ity of opportun## ity between all 25 Member State## s . 
all this report does is to permit the 10 new Member State## s to take advantage of an experiment## al schem## e for app## ly## ing reduce## d rates of V## AT to labour @## -## @ intens## ive service## s , which 9 of the pre## vi## ous 15 had be## en do## ing since 19## 99 . 
the schem## e was un## expect## ed## ly car## ried forward and there## fore was not include## d in the enlarge## ment negoti## ations . 
I am ver## y pleas## ed that this vot## e ha## s car## ried today . 
how## ever , this a controversial matter in the Council . 
in## de## ed , un## anim## ity is require## d even for this report to be implement## ed by the Council . 
I regret to say that my own Member State , the UK , is one of th## ose which ha## s &apos; reserv## ations &apos; about this ; and some member## s of the Committee on Eco## nomic and Mon## et## ary Affair## s fear## ed that per## hap## s the UK or other## s might torpedo this report . 
but , more th## an that , this Parliament ha## s , since the start of the experiment , whole## hearted## ly support## ed the principle . 
I hope that this vot## e today will encourag## e the Council to ensu## re fair## ness a## cross all 25 Member State## s for the remain## ing time of the current experiment ; and I also say , with the full support of the chair## man of the Committee on Eco## nomic and Mon## et## ary Affair## s , Mr## s Berès , that we should be press## ing the Council to make this a per## man## ent feature of our hope## s of achiev## ing the Lisbon Strategy . 
I hope Parliament will support that . 
that conclude## s the vot## e . 
.## - I vot## ed for the re## quest for consult## ation of the European Eco## nomic and Soci## al Committee - European Agri## cultural Fund for R## ural Develop## ment on the propos## al for a Council regulation on support for r## ural development by the European Agri## cultural Fund for R## ural Develop## ment ( EA## F## RD ) . 
I consider that the European Eco## nomic and Soci## al Committee should be consult## ed in view of the strategic import## ance of the common agri## cultural policy reform## s in 20## 03 and 20## 04 . 
since it ha## s be## en conclude## d that the main target of policy reform in the new financial period should be r## ural development , it must also be under## line## d that more th## an half of the EU @## -## @ 25 population live## s in r## ural area## s , which cover 90 % of our ter## rit## ory . 
r## ural development is there## fore an import## ant political area , a fact that was reiterate## d in the conclusion## s of the Lisbon ( Mar## ch 20## 00 ) and Gothenburg ( Ju## ne 20## 01 ) European Council## s . 
I think it is essential , th## en , that we , together with the vari## ous institutional play## ers , should find measure## s that will help to monitor and to further supplement the CAP reform## s and to ensu## re that the## y are consist## ent with first pillar instrument## s and poli## cies , and that will also contribut## e to other political priorit## ies of the European Union , s## uch as the sustain## able manage## ment of natural resource## s , innov## ation and competitive## ness in r## ural area## s , as well as economic and social cohes## ion . 
.## - I vot## ed for the re## quest for consult## ation of the Committee of the Region## s - ER## DF , ES## F and the Cohesion Fund on the propos## al for a Council regulation lay## ing down general provision## s on the European Region## al Develop## ment Fund , the European Soci## al Fund and the Cohesion Fund . 
I consider that one of the fundamental instrument## s be## hind the solid## arity that define## s the European Union is it## s cohes## ion policy - a policy that must be ambitious and able to address the challenge## s of the la## test enlarge## ment and the new prospect## s for economic grow## th in Europe . 
consult## ation of the Committee of the Region## s is essential in view of the strategic import## ance of these fund## s . 
the Union &apos;## s cohes## ion policy make## s an import## ant contribut## ion to## ward## s achiev## ing it## s grow## th and cohes## ion object## ive## s be## cause , by re## duc## ing economic and social dis## par## ities , the Union is help## ing to ensu## re that all region## s and social group## s can contribut## e . 
.## - I vot## ed for the re## quest for consult## ation of the Committee of the Region## s - ER## DF on the propos## al for a Council regulation on the European Region## al Develop## ment Fund . 
I think this consult## ation is essential in view of the import## ance of the ER## DF in correct## ing regional im## balance## s . 
regional dis## par## ities with## in the EU have become wor## s## e since the re## cent enlarge## ment , be## cause there ha## s be## en a huge increas## e in the number of under## develop## ed region## s . 
I consider the harmon## ious development of the vari## ous region## s of Europe to be a const## ant challenge to which we must respond with clear object## ive## s and firm political decision## s . 
the development of the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s ter## rit## ory , which ha## s increas## ed with enlarge## ment , require## s great## er territorial co## operation , bas## ed on joint local development project## s with## in the con## text of cross @## -## @ border co## operation and on measure## s lead## ing to integrate## d territorial development , for which we need the particip## ation of all the regional play## ers . 
.## - I vot## ed for the re## quest for consult## ation of the Committee of the Region## s - Cohesion Fund on the propos## al for a Council regulation establish## ing a Cohesion Fund . 
the contribut## ion that the Committee of the Region## s can make to the Cohesion Fund review process is in## dispens## able , since this is the fund that will help to finance project## s in the field## s of the environment and trans @## -## @ European network## s on the subject of transport infra## structure . 
I believ## e that this review should retain the basic principle## s that define this policy and base it## self on a global balance between strength## ening the strategic dimension on the one hand and simpl## ifying the implement## ation system on the other , with## out there## by creat## ing a situ## ation that reduce## s solid## arity a## mong the Member State## s , which is bo## th a principle and a character## istic of this Union of State## s . 
.## - I vot## ed for the re## quest for consult## ation of the Committee of the Region## s - European group## ing of cross @## -## @ border co## operation ( E## G## CC ) on the propos## al for a Council regulation establish## ing a European group## ing of cross @## -## @ border co## operation ( E## G## CC ) . 
the Committee of the Region## s ought to be consult## ed in view of the import## ance of the power## s exerc## ised by bodies with local and regional power in the## ir capacity as public author## ities . 
in view of the serious difficult## ies en## counter## ed by the Member State## s , region## s and local author## ities in carry## ing out and man## aging cross @## -## @ border , trans## national and inter## regional co## operation measure## s in a con## text of different national law## s and procedure## s , it is essential to adopt adequate measure## s at Comm## un## ity level to allevi## ate s## uch difficult## ies . 
this new Comm## un## ity @## -## @ level co## operation instrument will allow the creation of Comm## un## ity ter## rit## ory of co## operative group## ing## s with the## ir own legal personal## ity , call## ed &apos; European group## ing## s of cross @## -## @ border co## operation &quot; ( E## G## CC ) . 
the harmon## ious development of the Comm## un## ity as a whole and the strength## ening of economic , social and territorial cohes## ion require a strength## ening of cross @## -## @ border co## operation and the adopt## ion of measure## s provid## ing for the remo## val of obstacle## s that hinder cross @## -## @ border co## operation . 
.## - The full , harmon## ious integration of the ten new Member State## s require## s the adapt## ation of all protocol## s pre## vi## ously confine## d to the 15 Member State## s , and it also require## s that this adapt## ation should take place as s## oon as possible . 
.## - This propos## al is the result of the author## isation grant## ed by the Council of the European Union to the European Commission on 26 Janu## ary 20## 04 to under## take and conclude negoti## ations with Mexico , with a view to the conclusion of an Addi## tion## al Protocol to the Eco## nomic Partner## ship , Poli## tic## al Co## ordination and Co## operation Agreement between the European Comm## un## ity and it## s Member State## s , of the one part , and the Unit## ed Mexican State## s , of the other part , to take account of the access## ion of the new Member State## s to the European Union . 
the access## ion of the above @## -## @ mention## ed new Member State## s in fact require## s a s## eries of legal adapt## ations s## o as to place them on an equal foot## ing in the custom## s , economic and competit## ion field## s .

the access## ion of these new Member State## s in fact require## s a s## eries of legal adapt## ations s## o as to place them on an equal foot## ing in the custom## s , economic and competit## ion field## s . I have vot## ed for the propos## al . 
.## - I vot## ed for the propos## al for a Council direct## ive be## cause I believ## e it ha## s al## read## y be## en afford## ed sufficient un## equi## vocal scrutin## y and appreci## ation in the Committee on Agri## culture , where it gain## ed well @## -## @ deserve## d , un## anim## ous approval . 
non## e## the## less , I wonder whet## her it is worth## while and necess## ary for s## uch question## s that mer## e## ly correct or update legisl## ation to have to follow the same procedure ( albeit simpl## ified ) as other report## s that deal with significant## ly more import## ant topic## s . 
in fact , in the case in point , I believ## e that the change ma## de to Direct## ive 87 / 3## 28 / E## EC can on## ly be under## stood in the light of an excess## ive## ly posit## ivist interpret## ation of Comm## un## ity law , since the s## tor## age of froze## n s## e## men of b## ovine anim## al## s that is provid## ed for at &apos; s## e## men collect## ion centre## s &quot; ( with own production ) could , by re## course to ordinary rule## s of legal interpret## ation , include the &apos; s## e## men s## tor## age centre## s &quot; ( with## out own production ) with## out any formal correct## ion be## ing necess## ary . 
it may sound trivial , but some## time## s even the ridicu## lous can be treat## ed serious## ly , or some## thing serious can seem ridicu## lous . 
.## - I welcome the propos## al to amend the Council regulation on support for r## ural development from the EA## GGF &apos; in order to prevent any differ## ence in treat## ment between the Member State## s &quot; that ma## de up the European Union be## fore enlarge## ment and the current 25 countries . 
it should be not## ed that this measure arise## s in the con## text of a debate on the budget in which there will be a real cut in fund## s compar## ed with the pre @## -## @ enlarge## ment period . 
that mean## s the continu## ation of a policy where## by support for r## ural development is us## ed as part of a strate## gy to contain common agri## cultural policy cost## s , to liberal## ise agri## cultural market## s and to negotiate with the World Trade Organ## isation . 
s## uch measure## s , how## ever , do not address the need to correct the pro## found in## justice## s present in the European Union &apos;## s agri## cultural policy and do not help the necess## ary and ur## gent drive for economic and social cohes## ion between it## s vari## ous Member State## s . 
the effective promot## ion of r## ural development require## s farm## ers , agri## cultural production and a model of sustain## able human development bas## ed on the enhance## ment of economic , social and cultural specific## ities and divers## ities . 
the Ju## ne List &apos;## s three member## s vot## ed again## st the report , since it is an integ## ral part of the provision## s for the common agri## cultural policy , which we wish to abolish . 
the common agri## cultural policy basic## ally need## s to be reform## ed , and the debate on it## s reform must begin with## out delay . 
we believ## e that , as ear## ly as 20## 05 , the EU should begin cut## ting back on agri## cultural aid . 
as a rule , the member## s of the Ju## ne List can## not there## fore vot## e in favour of the vari## ous report## s with## in the agri## cultural sphere that are present## ed to the European Parliament . 
. - We consider it right in principle that the level of particip## ation in programme## s support## ing r## ural development by countries which accede## d to the EU on 1 May 20## 04 should be balance## d with that of the exist## ing Member State## s . 
non## e## the## less , we are impress## ed by the assurance that this ba## lancing act will be achiev## ed at no financial cost to the Comm## un## ity budget , give## n that the particip## ation of the ten new countries in the programme## s will increas## e from 80 % to 85 % , and by the fact that it concern## s object## ive 1 region## s on## ly , leav## ing the question of the other region## s un## clear . 
what is ultimate## ly import## ant is not the s## ize of the appropri## ations and the number of programme## s , but the## ir orient## ation , which is acute## ly anti @## -## @ farm## ing and hostil## e to any real r## ural development . 
.## - Si## nce this propos## al concern## s an amend## ment to the regulation in order to prevent any differ## ence in treat## ment between the old Member State## s and th## ose that accede## d d## uring this year &apos;## s enlarge## ment , and since there is no budget## ary change result## ing from that amend## ment , I am in favour of it . 
.## - I recognis## e that the Member State## s that join## ed the Comm## un## ity on 1 May 20## 04 deserve at least the same treat## ment from it## s institution## s as that grant## ed to the old## er Member State## s . 
I there## fore vot## ed for the propos## ed amend## ment , since it aim## s at prevent## ing a situ## ation of in## equal## ity from ar## ising as regard## s the limit of the financial contribut## ions to be ma## de under Regul## ation ( EC ) No 12## 57 / 19## 99 , in that it is prefer## able to app## ly the thir## d in## dent of the second sub## paragraph of Article 47 ( 2 ) to the new Member State## s . 
.## - This is an administ## rative issue but one that is correct in term## s of account## ing practice since it put## s right a situ## ation that was just## ified be## fore Austria join## ed the Union but no long## er make## s sense . 
I am there## fore in favour of this report . 
.## - The milk produce## d in the Austria## n region## s of Kle## in## w## al## s## er## tal and Jung## ho## lz is on## ly access## ible to Germa## n buy## ers , since the on## ly access to th## ose area## s is by road from Germa## ny . 
regulation ( EC ) No 17## 82 / 20## 03 , how## ever , which introduce## d direct payment## s for the dai## ry sector , left the administ## ration of the individual reference quant## ities of the produce## rs in question to the Germa## n author## ities . 
at the same time , it stipul## ated that the dai## ry premium should be paid out by the Austria## n author## ities with## in the limit of the## ir national reference quant## ity and the## ir budget## ary ceil## ing . 
this result## ed in a high## ly irrational situ## ation , as one might imagin## e . 
it is essential to administ## er the dai## ry premium in a fair and balance## d way . 
it is there## fore necess## ary to convert the Germa## n reference quant## ities of the produce## rs concern## ed in## to Austria## n reference quant## ities as from milk quota year 20## 04 / 20## 05 . 
I vot## ed for the propos## al . 
.## - I vot## ed for the report be## cause I believ## e it is essential that our legal instrument## s should be amend## ed follow## ing the Council decision of Ju## ne 20## 04 , s## o that the process may take it## s course and achiev## e all it## s object## ive## s , which will on## ly be possible - and tru## ly effective - with the amend## ments suggest## ed here by the Council . 
.## - Per## hap## s be## cause I am a citizen of a Member State that ha## s benefit## ed and s## till benefit## s from financial instrument## s that promot## e development and cohes## ion with## in Europe and be## cause I can see the real improve## ments that the## y have br## ought to my country , I believ## e I am in a position to understand the cruc## ial import## ance of access to th## ose instrument## s by the new Member State## s and also by candid## ate countries , as is the case with Croatia . 
I there## fore think it is benefic## ial to amend the regulation## s laid down under th## ose instrument## s , s## o as to en## able that country to have satisfactory access to them as part of the pre @## -## @ access## ion process on which it is embark## ing . 
even d## uring the curr## ency of the present financial perspective , the instrument## s in question ( PH## AR## E , ISP## A , SAP## A## RD ) will be able to contribut## e to structural improve## ments in administ## rative , legal and environment## al term## s and in the agri## cultural and transport sector## s , prepar## ing Croatia to adopt the un## ified Instrument for Pre @## -## @ Access## ion Assi## stance ( IP## A ) , which will be ma## de avail## able to it from 20## 07 . 
. 
it is cruc## ial that statistic## s are reli## able , and for that to happen , agree## ments must be in place between different countries in order to ensu## re the valid## ity of the data us## ed as indic## ators , due to the fact that the## y are recognis## ed and mutual## ly validate## d . 
in the particular case of the Swiss Con## federation , this question take## s on great## er import## ance give## n that country &apos;## s proxim## ity . 
. 
the report be## fore us follow## s up the Council decision on the conclusion of the agree## ment between the European Comm## un## ity and the Swiss Con## federation in the field of statistic## s . 
as we know , relation## s between the EU and Switzer## land have grown close## r over the course of the year## s , at economic , social and political level## s . 
the plan here is for th## ose relation## s to extend in## to the area of statistic## al co## operation . 
I , personal## ly , fully endorse the propos## al be## fore us , which , as far as we are concern## ed , should have be## en implement## ed long ago . 
Switzer## land was actual## ly a party to the agree## ment on the European Eco## nomic Area - an agree## ment that cover## ed statistic## al co## operation - but was un## able to rat## ify it , be## cause of a &apos; no &quot; vot## e in a national refer## endum on the issue in 19## 92 . 
accord## ing## ly , follow## ing vari## ous bilateral agree## ments , some of which we## re more formal th## an other## s , it is time to draw a definitive line under the 19## 92 re## verse , and definitive## ly to conclude the negoti## ations mandate## d in 20## 00 , there## by establish## ing a complete frame## work for co## operation with Switzer## land extend## ed to the area of statistic## s . 
the purpose of the regulation with which the report is concern## ed is to employ support measure## s to improve social conditio## ns , employ## ment and the comp## let## ion of a free @## -## @ trade area for the area of Europe and the Medi## terranean . 
a free trade area is , how## ever , best set up through the EU &apos;## s abolish## ing du## ties , subsid## ies and export grant## s . 
it is up to e## ach Member State to decide upon support measure## s in the form of aid and invest## ments , with## out making a de## tour via the EU budget . 
the Ju## ne List can## not there## fore vot## e in favour of the report . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of the report by Mr Gar## g## ani ( ) on the propos## al for a Council regulation on financial and technical measure## s to accompany the reform of economic and social structure## s in the frame## work of the Euro @## -## @ Medi## terranean partner## ship ( MED## A ) ( Co## d## ified version ) . 
simpl## ifying and clar## ifying Comm## un## ity legisl## ation are import## ant ways to bring the institution## s close## r to the citizen## s . 
the dispers## ed nature of man## y provision## s , and amend## ments there## to , advers## e## ly affect## s the trans## par## ency need## ed for people to be able to understand Comm## un## ity text## s . 
cod## ification is laud## able work and absolut## e## ly necess## ary . 
Europe must be at the service of the Member State## s and the## ir citizen## s , and , accord## ing## ly , must not produce legisl## ative text## s that are cloak## ed in obfusc## ation . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of this new cod## ification of Council Regul## ation ( EC ) No 14## 88 / 96 and sub## sequent amend## ments there## to , which fully pre## serve## s the content of the cod## ified act## s . 
this satisf## ies the intention to press a## head with simpl## ifying and clar## ifying Comm## un## ity legisl## ation , in order to make it easi## er for every## one to access , to understand and to implement it . 
this is an area that I have al## ways believ## ed to be of major import## ance to the EU &apos;## s futur## e : name## ly , making European legisl## ative mechan## ism## s and regulation## s easi## er to understand , ra## ising aware## ness of them and bring## ing them close## r to Europe &apos;## s citizen## s . 
as regard## s this particular issue , I should also like to point out that vari## ous re## cent European Council## s , ( Lisbon , Corfu and Essen ) have not## ed that the Medi## terranean zone is a priorit## y region for the EU and have adopt## ed the aim of establish## ing a genuine and effective Euro @## -## @ Medi## terranean partner## ship . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of the propos## al be## fore us aim## ed at cod## ifying Decision 73 / 39## 1 / E## EC and sub## sequent amend## ments and add## ition## s there## to , on consult## ation and inform## ation procedure## s in matter## s of credit insur## ance , credit guarantee## s and financial credit## s . 
this is mer## e## ly a matter of formal amend## ments require## d by the cod## ification process . 
in this case , cod## ification is all the more import## ant give## n that the issue is of a special cross @## -## @ border nature . 
one last thing to which I should like to draw your attention , which is consist## ent with the Eco## nomic and Soci## al Committee &apos;## s opinion : care## ful attention should be paid to the accuracy of translat## ions , be## cause any in## ac## cur## acies could lead to legal un## certain## ty and , in turn , to in## correct implement## ation of the text . 
. 
the propos## al be## fore us simpl## y consist## s of cod## ifying all exist## ing Comm## un## ity legisl## ation in this area , in order to ensu## re great## er clar## ity and better understand## ing of the legisl## ation . 
it is import## ant that this should be the case . 
there have be## en man## y direct## ive## s regul## ating the mini## mum level of crude oil and / or petrol## e## um product## s . 
broad## ly s## peak## ing , all of th## ose direct## ive## s stress the fundamental import## ance of s## uch product## s to the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s supply of energ## y product## s . 
these product## s come from thir## d countries , and a reduction in the## ir supply might have serious effect## s on the European Comm## un## ity &apos;## s economic activity . 
again## st this back## drop , the propos## al be## fore us seek## s to help European citizen## s to be aware of and to understand the rule## s and , more import## ant## ly , seek## s to creat## e the necess## ary conditio## ns to solv## e any potent## ial short## age of this vital energ## y source . 
I there## fore vot## ed in favour . 
we believ## e it is th## ose countries situ## ated a## round the Baltic Sea that must deal with the issue of the futur## e manage## ment of fish## ing resource## s in the Baltic . 
we believ## e that the European Comm## un## ities should not have that compete## nce . 
the issue of man## aging the world &apos;## s fish## ing resource## s must be deal## t with part## ly via the Unit## ed Nation## s and , in the case of the Baltic , between the Baltic countries . 
we have there## fore cho## s## en to vot## e again## st this report . 
. 
I welcome this report fulfill## ing the European Parliament &apos;## s require## ment to ver## ify the cred## ent## ial## s of it## s Member## s , ( under the term## s of Article 12 of the Act concern## ing the elect## ion of the represent## ative## s of the European Parliament by direct universal suff## rage , as amend## ed by the Council decision of 25 Ju## ne / 22 Sept## ember 20## 02 ) work## ing on an EU and Member State level . 
this report high## light## s the need to update the current provision## s of the Rule## s of Procedure , making them more compatible with the new provision## s of the 19## 76 Act . 
in particular , this report emphasis## es the need to combat certain loop## hole## s ar## ising in the transit## ion from one parliament to the next . 
for ex## ample , dual parliament## ary mandate issue## s . 
. 
the issue be## fore us is a Commission propos## al on the futur## e manage## ment of the fisher## ies resource## s of the Baltic Sea and the Bel## ts . 
the propos## al seek## s to re## shape the nature of the relation## ship between the EU and thir## d countries that are party to agree## ments conclude## d on the above @## -## @ mention## ed sea area## s , follow## ing the re## cent access## ion to the EU of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Po## land . 
current## ly , and until Dec## ember 20## 05 , the futur## e manage## ment of fisher## ies resource## s of the Baltic Sea and the Bel## ts is regulate## d by the 19## 73 agree## ment , conclude## d by the European Comm## un## ity , the Baltic State## s , Po## land and Russia , known as the Gdansk Convent## ion . 
as a direct result of the## ir access## ion to the EU , the above @## -## @ mention## ed Member State## s with## drew from the agree## ment . 
con## sequent## ly , the agree## ment now appli## es s## ole## ly between the EU and the Russia## n Fede## ration . 
the Commission there## fore propos## es the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s withdraw## al from the agree## ment . 
if this does not happen , relation## s between the EU and Russia would be regulate## d by an instrument creat## ed for multilateral co## operation , and this might have advers## e con## sequenc## es . 
I support the rapporteur in that I welcome this propos## al and , at the same time , I understand the concern## s that the object## ive## s of protect## ing .## .. 
we believ## e that the European Convent## ion should be grant## ed dis## charge for 20## 03 , be## cause there are no reason## s for bring## ing the economic report in## to question . 
we non## e## the## less oppose the Convent## ion &apos;## s lack of represent## ative## ness and un## democratic work## ing method## s . 
a## mong the Convent## ion &apos;## s just over one hundred member## s , women , young people and critic## s of the EU we## re serious## ly under @## -## @ represent## ed . 
the Convent## ion can## not there## fore claim to represent the citizen## s of Europe . 
what is more , the Convent## ion &apos;## s President , Val## é## ry Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing , and hi## s Pra## e## sidium design## ed policy as the## y them## selves saw fit . 
propos## al## s we## re introduce## d that have no bas## is in the work## ing group## s or in plen## ary . 
no vot## es took place in plen## ary , and Gis## card him## self decide## d how the major## ities look## ed . 
we share the ana## lysis ma## de by Gis## ela Stu## art , a Brit## ish member of the Convent## ion &apos;## s Pra## e## sidium , in her book &apos; The Ma## king of Europe &apos;## s Constitution &quot; ( Fa## bian Soci## ety , 20## 03 ) . 
in her view , the work of the Convent## ion was shape## d by an un## account## able political elit## e that had al## read## y decide## d the final out## come from the out## set . 
. 
give## n that this expend## iture was validate## d by the Court of Audit## ors , which felt that it had obtain## ed reason## able assurance that the account## s for the financial year end## ed 31 Dec## ember 20## 03 we## re reli## able and that the under## ly## ing transact## ions we## re , on the whole , legal and regular , I am vot## ing in favour of this re## commend## ation . 
. 
I share the rapporteur &apos;## s conclusion that , in light of the assent give## n by the Council on 8 Ju## ly 20## 04 and by the Commission on 19 October 20## 04 and the compliance acknowledg## ed by the Court of Audit## ors on 13 May 20## 04 , there does not appear to be any just## ification for Parliament to with## hold it## s assent to the grant## ing of dis## charge for the financial year 20## 03 to the Secret## ary @## -## @ General of the Convent## ion . 
I natural## ly welcome the trans## par## ency and , to use the word of the Court of Audit## ors , the reli## ability , of the account## s for the financial year . 
I also agree that the residue should be apportion## ed between the three Institut## ions that contribut## ed to the Convent## ion &apos;## s budget . 
I vot## ed in favour . 
the member## s of the Ju## ne List have cho## s## en to vot## e again## st the report be## cause the Committee on Budget## s &quot; propos## ed change## s open the way to further EU commit## ments , with## out any require## ment for co## ordination with other international financial institution## s . 
the Ju## ne List is oppose## d to the Commission &apos;## s propos## al and believ## es that the EI## B should not issue the propos## ed loan guarantee . 
the Ju## ne List re## commend## s in## stead that th## ose countries that are affect## ed by loan guarantee## s and that benefit from these should them## selves stand as guarantor## s of th## ose loan## s or find other play## ers in the free market to do s## o . 
accord## ing to the Ju## ne List , the propos## al is not in the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s interest but is in danger of be## coming an expensive fail## ure if loan guarantee## s are give## n with## out be## ing test## ed by the market in the usual way . 
the Ju## ne List would ideal## ly have like## d to have seen the Commission &apos;## s propos## al too reject## ed in the vot## e but , ironic## ally , find## s the Commission &apos;## s origin## al propos## al less object## ion## able th## an the one present## ed by the Committee on Budget## s .

on the propos## al for a Council decision grant## ing a Comm## un## ity guarantee to the European Invest## ment Bank again## st los## s## es under loan## s for certain type## s of project## s in Russia and the Western New In## dependent State## s ( W## NI## S ) . 
the EU &apos;## s external policy is , in this case , express## ed through a &apos; Neighbour## hood Poli## cy , &quot; which will en## able th## ose countries to continu## e on the path to economic , social and political development . 
it strike## s me as import## ant to point out that the EU &apos;## s external lend## ing capacity is an import## ant foreign policy development instrument and , in turn , a power## ful tool in the over## all capacity of the EU to contribut## e to development and securit## y in our im## mediate neighbour## hood . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of the propos## al for a decision be## fore us , which fall## s with## in the s## cope of the Commission &apos;## s communic## ation of Mar## ch 20## 03 entitle## d &apos; Wi## der Europe - Neighbour## hood : a new frame## work for relation## s with our eastern and southern neighbour## s , &quot; which laid down a strate## gy for creat## ing a &apos; circl## e of friend## s &quot; - an area of share## d value## s , st## ability and prosper## ity , and one in which it is possible to achiev## e deep## er economic integration . 
I welcome the approach that the decision is to cover the activity of the EI## B &apos;## s loan## s until the end of Janu## ary 20## 07 , earmark## ed for area## s s## uch as the environment , transport , tele## communic## ations and energ## y infra## structure . 
a further reason to welcome this propos## al is that it is du## ly consist## ent with the EU @## -## @ Russia Summit held in the Ha## gue on 25 N## ov## ember 20## 04 , aim## ed at promot## ing strategic partner## ships and deepen## ing what are refer## red to as the &apos; Four Common S## pace## s , &quot; name## ly , a common economic space ; a common space of free## dom , securit## y and justice ; a common space in the field of external securit## y ; and a common space of research , educ## ation and culture . 
. 
the issue be## fore us is the thir## d read## mission agree## ment between the European Comm## un## ity and a thir## d country , which form## s part of the s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; fight again## st illegal im## migration . &quot; 
the rapporteur point## s out , and I quote , that &apos; negoti## ations of read## mission agree## ments are mov## ing forward with difficult## y , in particular be## cause of the problem## s the European Union ha## s in offer## ing any## thing in exchange for the agree## ments . &quot; 
this essential## ly boil## s down to expel## ling all workers , who , eager for a new life , e## migrate to an## other country , but who find them## selves fac## ed with human resource## s &apos; manage## ment , &quot; which sift## s them and re## move## s th## ose it deem## s surplus to require## ments , and this is some## thing that we have repeat## ed## ly condemn## ed . 
this process form## s part of a tend## ency to## ward## s &apos; global## ly &quot; exploit## ing the work## force , and these agree## ments are no more th## an one of the visible face## s of that tend## ency . 
hence our vot## e again## st . 
the read## mission agree## ment with S## ri Lanka is part and parcel of the introdu## ction of a common im## migration policy . 
the Ju## ne List does not , how## ever , wish to contribut## e to any Fort## re## s## s Europe . 
measure## s concern## ing illegal im## migration and reside## nce , including the repatri## ation of illegal im## migrants , should be an issue for the Member State## s &quot; national parliament## s . 
con## sequent## ly , we are vot## ing again## st the report . 
. 
agree## ments of this kind , which have be## en sign## ed with vari## ous countries , are of major import## ance in the fight again## st illegal im## migration . 
the## y are also concern## ed with safeguard## ing respect for human right## s , give## n that we must remain vigil## ant to ensu## re that the law is be## ing strict## ly com## plied with . 
I am there## fore in favour of the## ir adopt## ion . 
. 
on the subject of the manage## ment of migr## atory flow## s , bas## ed on the Amsterdam Treat## y , the Tampere Summit call## ed for &apos; assist## ance to countries of origin and transit to be develop## ed in order to promot## e voluntary return as well as to help the author## ities of th## ose countries to strength## en the## ir ability to combat effective## ly traffick## ing in human be## ing## s and to cope with the## ir read## mission oblig## ations to## ward## s the Union and the Member State## s &quot; ( IV## .## 26## . ) . 
the purpose of the propos## al for a decision be## fore us is to regulate the conditio## ns under which the EU and the S## ri Lanka## n author## ities will re## admit people who do not have legal reside## nce in e## ach other &apos;## s ter## rit## ory , a practice that the Comm## un## ity would like to see include## d in all futur## e agree## ments with thir## d countries ; and right## ly s## o in my view . 
not## with## standing the need for strict control## s on access to the Comm## un## ity area , which must be kept up , I share the Fo## reign Affair## s Committee &apos;## s desir## e to ensu## re that the need to respect human right## s is n## ever over## look## ed . 
I vot## ed in favour . 
. 
the Commission di## d not manage to obtain a un## anim## ous decision in the Council on it## s propos## al for a direct## ive on simpl## ifying and stream## lining reduce## d V## AT rates . 
con## sequent## ly , the period of application of Direct## ive 19## 99 / 85 / EU , author## ising Member State## s to app## ly , on an experiment## al bas## is , a reduce## d V## AT rate on labour @## -## @ intens## ive service## s , ha## s be## en repeat## ed## ly extend## ed , and now come## s to an end on 31 Dec## ember 20## 05 . 
the purpose of this re## cast## ing of the Direct## ive is to make it possible for the new Member State## s , follow## ing enlarge## ment , to app## ly it , and this is some## thing that we welcome . 
whi## lst the Commission &apos;## s assess## ment report say## s that the effect## s of this measure are neglig## ible and that the cost / benefit r## atio is un## favour## able , the Commission &apos;## s main object## ive revolve## s a## round the difficult## y of harmon## ising V## AT , al## though it does state that this measure does not prejudice the rule## s of the internal market . 
al## though we have certain reserv## ations about this measure , and taking account of the fact that the measure will not solv## e the problem## s of high un## employ## ment in the EU , we feel that this author## isation should be maintain## ed for Member State## s that wish to app## ly it per## man## ent## ly . 
this will contribut## e further to## ward## s creat## ing job## s and to## ward## s combat## ing the parallel econom## y . 
we hope that the new Member State## s will make the## ir contribut## ion to## ward## s achiev## ing this aim . 
. 
the adopt## ion by the Council , on 22 October 19## 99 , of Direct## ive 19## 99 / 85 / EC amend## ing Direct## ive 77 / 88 / E## EC , was intend## ed to foster the experiment## al schem## e of reduce## d V## AT rates for labour intens## ive service## s , there## by en## ab## ling th## ose Member State## s wish## ing to do s## o to test the effect## s of reduce## d V## AT on th## ose sector## s in term## s of creat## ing job## s and combat## ing the parallel econom## y . 
the experiment was eventual## ly the subject of an assess## ment report that reveal## ed that it is not possible to establish a direct cor## relation between re## duc## ing V## AT rates and combat## ing un## employ## ment and the parallel econom## y . 
re## duc## ing V## AT rates does not strike me as the best or most appropriate way of boost## ing the labour market and re## duc## ing the parallel econom## y . 
give## n that nothing , how## ever , was laid down - the experiment was due to finish definitive## ly on 31 Dec## ember 20## 03 - regard## ing the possibil## ity of the new Member State## s app## ly## ing reduce## d rates , the situ## ation had become un## fair . 
as I feel that the new Member State## s should be entitle## d to the same opportun## ity , I vot## ed in favour . 
. 
I am de## light## ed to indic## ate my support for this Report and for the extens## ion of the P## EA## CE Pro## gramme . 
this programme ha## s ma## de an origin## al and essential contribut## ion to re## conciliation , re## build## ing trust between neighbour## s and bring## ing communit## ies together from bo## th side## s of the border . 
the P## EA## CE project## s have contribut## ed great## ly to promot## ing mutual understand## ing and better communit## y relation## s and I am de## light## ed that fund## ing ha## s now be## en extend## ed to the end of 20## 06 . 
there is not doubt that our hope## s for a peace## ful futur## e depend on the good work of the vari## ous cross @## -## @ border and North @## -## @ South initiative## s fund## ed under this programme . 
we have vot## ed again## st this report . 
we believ## e that th## ose Member State## s that wish to contribut## e to the Inter## national Fund for Ireland must do s## o by de## cid## ing in the## ir respect## ive national parliament## s to give s## uch contribut## ions . 
the Member State## s must fund these contribut## ions direct## ly out of the## ir respect## ive state budget## s , and the money should not need to take a de## tour via the EU budget . 
. 
on the propos## al for a Council regulation concern## ing Comm## un## ity financial contribut## ions to the Inter## national Fund for Ireland ( 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 06 ) . 
this fund s## till ha## s major import## ance in re## build## ing area## s devastate## d by the inst## ability cause## d by deca## de## s of terrorism . 
it## s object## ive## s continu## e to be press## ing object## ive## s and at this histo## ric time of negoti## ations on last## ing peace , the EU must show solid## arity with the Irish people . 
. 
the Inter## national Fund for Ireland , which was set up in 19## 86 , with the aim of help## ing to implement the Ang## lo @## -## @ Irish Agreement , of promot## ing economic and social advance## s and of encourag## ing contact , dia## logue and re## conciliation between national## ists and union## ists through## out Ireland , ha## s done extreme## ly use## ful and posit## ive work in promot## ing economic and social development to## ward## s peace and re## conciliation in the region . 
the process of con## solid## ating peace in North## ern Ireland and in the Irish border region is now , o## nce again , en## circl## ed by threat## s and un## certain## ty . 
in## de## ed , the North## ern Ireland Assemb## ly ha## s be## en suspend## ed . 
again## st this back## drop , the promot## ion of peace through economic and social development in the region## s of bo## th part## s of Ireland take## s on extra significance . 
it is a process that , at grass## root## s level , ha## s be## en car## ried out in exempl## ary fashion by the Inter## national Fund for Ireland . 
I there## fore feel that the Commission should adopt the propos## al for a Council regulation concern## ing Comm## un## ity financial contribut## ions to the Inter## national Fund for Ireland . 
I am , con## sequent## ly , vot## ing in favour . 
. 
a key element in the running of a represent## ative democratic institution is compliance with the principle## s govern## ing - appropriate## ly - the rule## s of parliament## ary immun## ity . 
con## sequent## ly , the decision to waiv## e the parliament## ary immun## ity of a Member of this House must be greet## ed with due caution . 
the case be## fore us concern## s the judicial process re## l## ating to behaviour that bear## s no relation to political activity . 
accord## ing## ly , and give## n the content of the report , I vot## ed in favour . 
. 
this is a sens## ible arrange## ment for the bilateral manage## ment of the Baltic Sea fisher## y resource## s , integrating the exist## ing bilateral agree## ments between the Russia## n Fede## ration and Estonia , Fin## land , Latvia , Lithuania , Po## land and Swede## n with## in a s## ing## le bilateral agree## ment . 
of course it is import## ant place a high priorit## y on maintain## ing stock## s of fish . 
it should also be kept in mind that the great## est threat to liv## ing resource## s in the Baltic Sea come## s from land and not from the sea , and the best way to limit the poll## ution of the sea is to integrate environment## al protection require## ments in## to the fisher## ies policy . 
this aspect should be one of the top priorit## ies while negoti## ating a bilateral agree## ment with the Comm## un## ity and the Russia## n Fede## ration . 
. 
the issue be## fore us is the creation of an instrument to facilit## ate the &apos; mobil## ity &quot; of workers in Europe and , in the rapporteur &apos;## s word## s , &apos; to help achiev## e the Lisbon 20## 00 strategic object## ive## s . &quot; 
as we have s## aid be## fore , the key question here is the purpose of s## uch an instrument ; will it serve to re## generate a country &apos;## s human resource## s or will it mer## e## ly help the most economic## ally develop## ed countries to exploit other countries &quot; human resource## s , by increas## ing workers &quot; &apos; mobil## ity &quot; ? 
we fear , and with good reason , that it will serve to ra## ise the number of technical or scientific staff e## migr## ating to the most economic## ally develop## ed countries , and that , to this end , the aim is to creat## e a European labour market , or even a European &apos; stock exchange &quot; of special## ised staff . 
let me state , o## nce again , that the propos## ed document## s al## read## y exist as a result of co## operation with the Council and / or UN## ESC## O . 
hence our vot## e in favour , albeit with critic## ism## s of the attempt## s to contamin## ate ap## parent## ly posit## ive aim## s . 
we do not believ## e it necess## ary for the EU to creat## e a standard document port## folio that EU citizen## s will be able to use in job application## s . 
the EU institution## s can , of course , have a standard document port## folio for th## ose seek## ing employ## ment with these institution## s . 
s## uch a document port## folio should not , how## ever , be turn## ed in## to a com## pul## s## ory standard require## ment . 
in## stead , this is an area in which the Member State## s them## selves must be able to take decision## s . 
. 
I congratul## ate Mr## s Nova## k on her excel## lent work on the establish## ment of a s## ing## le Comm## un## ity frame## work for the trans## par## ency of qual## ification## s and compete## nce## s - Europa## s## s . 
the aim of this propos## al is to creat## e a uniform &apos; port## folio &quot; of document## s that will en## able citizen## s app## ly## ing for a job or a course of stu## dy to set out the## ir personal qual## ification## s in a mann## er that is compar## able through## out the EU . 
Europa## s## s will facilit## ate professional mobil## ity and encourag## e learn## ing in Europe , and this will help achiev## e the object## ive## s of the Lisbon strate## gy . 
I endorse the creation of Europa## s## s be## cause mobil## ity is an import## ant factor in creat## ing better job## s and in re## duc## ing the s## kill## s short## fall in the European labour market . 
I am convince## d that it will provid## e the necess## ary im## petus to break down the bar## rier## s that European citizen## s come up again## st in this field . 
I should also like to under## line the need to avoid prolong## ing the legisl## ative process , and there## fore vot## ed in favour of Europa## s## s , which will en## able it to enter in## to force as ear## ly as Janu## ary 20## 05 . 
. 
in line with the aim of great## er co## ordination , stream## lining and trans## par## ency of qual## ification## s and s## kill## s , we must promot## e the integration of measure## s in the area of the cert## ification of qual## ification## s in## to a s## ing## le frame## work . 
this is not an issue of recognis## ing diploma## s , but of simpl## ifying the process## es for setting out qual## ification## s and s## kill## s . 
I there## fore vot## ed in favour of this re## commend## ation . 
. 
the legisl## ative propos## al be## fore us aim## s to creat## e a s## ing## le &apos; port## folio &quot; of document## s , which will en## able citizen## s to set out the## ir abilities , s## kill## s and qual## ification## s and will facilit## ate the recogn## ition in the labour market of train## ing course## s and work experience under## take## n a## broad . 
it will there## fore foster professional and educational mobil## ity in Europe . 
in add## ition to making qual## ification## s and s## kill## s compar## able , the propos## al be## fore us also help## s to achiev## e the Lisbon 20## 00 object## ive## s , to turn Europe in## to the &apos; most dynamic and competitive area in the world &quot; by 20## 10 . 
accord## ing## ly , Europa## s## s - which com## prise## s document## s refer## ring to train## ing course## s in different countries , to high## er educ## ation , to knowledge of language## s and to professional train## ing - will make a major contribut## ion not on## ly to these object## ive## s , but also to an increas## e in the qual## ity of general and professional educ## ation in Europe . 
this is a welcome and high## ly import## ant measure for young people . 
as s## uch , it must enter in## to force at the ear## liest opportun## ity . 
I vot## ed in favour . 
. - The Europa## s## s is y## et an## other lever to replace system## atic and integrate## d educ## ation with fragment## ed s## kill## s and out## d## ated train## ing adapt## ed to current market demand## s , in the aim of exploit## ing workers and in full harmon## isation with the Lisbon strate## gy . 
it make## s employ## ers al## one respons## ible for the evalu## ation of educational and vocation## al qual## ification## s , s## o that the## y can s## elect the most &apos; convenient &apos; work## er for the## ir exploit## ative require## ments , depriv## ing the educ## ation system of this role . 
the Europa## s## s is open to renew## al and the inclus## ion of more new demand## s by employ## ers ; it will also tend to be convert## ed in## to a tool for keeping record## s on workers , with de## script## ions not on## ly of the## ir s## kill## s and knowledge , but also of the## ir view## s , per## suasion## s and conduct . 
talk of facilit## ating educational and professional mobil## ity is a smoke screen . 
the policy of &apos; life## long learn## ing &apos; and of inter## change## able individual train## ing modul## es obstruct## s ra## ther th## an facilit## ate## s mobil## ity and mark## s &apos; the absolut## e avail## ability of man to the alter## nating demand## s of labour &apos; . 
we call for the Europa## s## s to be abolish## ed and for the adopt## ion of : 1 ) a s## ing## le , free , state educ## ation system which will creat## e an integrate## d educational found## ation and fundamental vocation## al train## ing which will result in full professional sufficiency and 2 ) a high standard of liv## ing and equal employ## ment , educ## ation and liv## ing conditio## ns for workers on the move .

- the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 69 / 20## 04 ) by Mr Rei## mer Böge , on be## half of the Committee on Budget## s , on the propos## al for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobil## isation of the flexibil## ity instrument accord## ing to point 24 of the Inter## institutional Agreement of 6 May 19## 99 &#91; COM ( 20## 04 ) 04## 02 - C## 6 @## -## @ 02## 13 / 20## 04 - 20## 04 / 20## 87 ( AC## I ) &#93; 
. 
Mr President , de## spite the tempt## ation every year to try to fund Parliament &apos;## s interest## s and blame the Council for every## thing else , I believ## e we are present## ing a good agree## ment today . 
the annual budget## ary procedure is a perfect ex## ample of how inter## institutional co## operation should be . 
I have be## en a member of the Committee on Budget## s for ten year## s and I have n## ever believ## ed that inter## institutional confront## ation is the right way to resolv## e budget## ary priorit## ies . 
I believ## e that time ha## s prov## en th## ose of us who prefer agree## ment to be right . 
the best conclusion for this 20## 05 draft budget would be for the three institution## s to be moderate## ly satisfied with the final result . 
it would be ridicu## lous to present this agree## ment as a victor## y for one institution over an## other , be## cause I believ## e that Europe is ma## de up of the three institution## s . 
it ha## s be## en a ver## y complic## ated year from a budget## ary point of view . 
we beg## an with a reduction in the ceil## ing## s for categor## ies 3 , 4 and 5 , which ha## s ma## de it ver## y difficult to comp## ly with this Parliament &apos;## s priorit## ies . 
the Member State## s have appli## ed budget## ary rigour , as a con## sequenc## e of the St## ability Pact , and that must continu## e in the futur## e . 
we have had European elect## ions : new MEP## s , a new Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s , who ha## s work## ed ver## y well and I congratul## ate him on that ; a new Commission and a new Commission## er , who ha## s also work## ed ver## y well and I congratul## ate her on that as well , and I also congratul## ate former Commission## er Sch## re## y## er . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , since Sept## ember of this year , I have be## en advoc## ating the follow## ing budget## ary strate## gy : to defend the European Parliament &apos;## s priorit## ies with regard to the Lisbon object## ive## s , inform## ation policy and the area## s of securit## y and justice . 
we defend these priorit## ies be## cause we are a political Parliament and we have promise## d our citizen## s a Europe with economic grow## th , job creation , better inform## ation on the present and the futur## e of the Union , better control of migr## atory flow## s and great## er securit## y again## st crime and terrorism . 
our contribut## ion to the creation of a genuine Comm## un## ity respons## e to terrorism is this Parliament &apos;## s best possible trib## ute to the al## most 200 European## s murder## ed in Madrid on 11 Mar## ch . 
I would like to thank all of you for your support . 
it was fundamental to our strate## gy that the European age## ncies should not be fund## ed unilateral## ly , at the expense of Parliament &apos;## s other priorit## ies . 
if we want more age## ncies , we must provid## e new resource## s . 
that was our position and I believ## e , lad## ies and gentle## men , that this Parliament ha## s achiev## ed al## most 1## 00 % of the strate## gy we establish## ed . 
we have manage## d to mobilise the flexibil## ity instrument in the s## um of EUR 18## 5 million and this is a new resource , which is great## er th## an the ceil## ing of the financial perspective## s . 
and with these new resource## s we have fund## ed EUR 40 million of the de## centralise## d age## ncies , which mean## s that , for the first time , the Council recognis## es the need to provid## e new resource## s to comp## ly with the new commit## ments . 
we have also us## ed EUR 1## 00 million from the flexibil## ity instrument to fund the re## construct## ion of Iraq , there## by leav## ing sufficient budget## ary margin to fund La## tin America , Asia , the Medi## terranean policy , the fight again## st dis## ease and p## over## ty and the demo## cracy and human right## s initiative , a## mong## st other thing## s . 
we are s## till concern## ed about the issue of payment## s , de## spite the fact that we have a statement by the three institution## s on the commit## ment to present an amend## ing budget in 20## 05 if necess## ary . 
the rigour and au## ster## ity we all app## ly - the three institution## s - is one thing , but the in## discrimin## ate sav## ing of payment appropri## ations , which could jeopard## ise budget## ary execu## tion in 20## 05 , is quit## e an## other . 
this Parliament will be particular## ly vigil## ant next year . 
budget## ary sav## ing## s should n## ever be at the expense of the Union &apos;## s need## s . 
the Council ha## s cut payment## s in agri## culture by EUR 1 billion , which , from a budget## ary point of view , is un## usual , and we await further ex## plan## ations from the Council . 
final## ly , lad## ies and gentle## men , we thank the Dutch Presidency for it## s pragmat## ism in the negoti## ation , which we expect## ed , and it## s great will## ing## ness to reach con## sensus with Parliament , which ha## s be## en a surprise . 
in any e## vent , thank you , Minister , for the role you have play## ed ; thank you , Commission## er , for your medi## ation . 
I hope to co## operate close## ly with you d## uring 20## 05 . 
thank you to the co## ordinator## s , the MEP## s , the member## s of the Budget## s secretariat and my own personal assist## ant . 
it ha## s be## en a pleas## ure to work with all of you on the draw## ing up of this 20## 05 draft budget , which I hope can be vot## ed for on Thursday with## out too man## y problem## s . 
Mr President , administ## rative expend## iture ha## s not of course be## en the most difficult aspect of this year &apos;## s budget negoti## ations , e## special## ly since employ## ees &quot; s## al## ary increas## es we## re clear## ly to remain be## low 1 % this year in## stead of 2.6 % , as origin## ally foresee## n . 
with the figure## s from Parliament &apos;## s first read## ing , there is thu## s a suit## able margin be## low the ceil## ing for administ## rative expend## iture . 
to this , we can add that certain institution## s have be## en able to expedite the## ir payment## s this year and have thu## s br## ought about the possibil## ity of sav## ing## s on the 20## 05 budget . 
all in all , it ha## s there## fore be## en success## fully ens## ured that the other institution## s - that is to say , apart from Parliament and the Council , the Court of Just## ice , the Court of Audit## ors , the European Eco## nomic and Soci## al Committee , the Committee of the Region## s , the European Ombuds## man and the European Data Protect## ion Supervisor - are able to make the planned staff appoint## ments result## ing from enlarge## ment , staff## ing reform## s and the reform of financial administ## ration . 
in practice , the sav## ing## s due to the lower s## al## ary increas## es will now be implement## ed with the help of an amend## ing budget in the course of 20## 05 . 
it was that agree## ment in## to which we enter## ed with the Council . 
we are not there## fore vot## ing on these sav## ing## s at Parliament &apos;## s second read## ing but , by making sav## ing## s by mean## s of a second amend## ing budget , we are also making sav## ing## s on the Council &apos;## s and Parliament &apos;## s budget## s , which have of course be## en drawn up in the light of the conciliation enter## ed in## to with the Council at first read## ing . 
s## o far , s## o good . 
it is import## ant for all the institution## s continu## ally to ensu## re that the administ## ration is as efficient and in## expensive as possible . 
it is e## special## ly import## ant , more## over , that we obtain financial gain## s through co## operation between the institution## s . 
that is also why I think it import## ant that , ear## ly next year - and be## fore 1 April - we obtain an update## d report from the secret## aries @## -## @ general on how the appoint## ments are going . 
we have seen the delay## s there have be## en in recruit## ing staff follow## ing enlarge## ment , and I think it import## ant that we close## ly follow up how these matter## s are proceed## ing s## o that we might see if there are like## ly to be problem## s . 
in other area## s , too , there is a real need for the institution## s to co## operate in the## ir delibe## rations . 
I should like at this point to restrict the focus some## what and also issue a challenge to Parliament &apos;## s leader## ship . 
one practical ex## ample is the Committee of the Region## s &quot; desir## e to be able to use Parliament &apos;## s meet## ing room## s in Bru## ssels for it## s meet## ing## s . 
it make## s good sense for us to make facilit## ies avail## able as long as , by do## ing s## o , we are not inter## fer## ing with Parliament &apos;## s work## ing arrange## ments . 
that is a decision that Parliament &apos;## s leader## ship must make . 
it must be a decision that fit## s in with our work , but also one that is remune## rative . 
Parliament &apos;## s budget stand## s at 20 % of administ## rative expend## iture and appear## s reason## able in relation to need## s . 
I would , how## ever , emphasis## e - as I have done in the past - that in re## cent year## s we have be## en able to deploy major expend## iture on pay## ing for build## ing## s under this 20 % budget , and we s## hall thu## s save on rent in the budget## s for the next few year## s . 
this will also happen in the current year when more th## an EUR 1## 30 million will be paid out on the two new build## ing## s - D## 4 and D## 5 - in Bru## ssels . 
when all is s## aid and done , there will be some room for manoeuvr## e in Parliament &apos;## s budget for 20## 05 , and I would there## fore call upon Parliament &apos;## s leader## s to look at the qual## ity of the assist## ance we are give## n as MEP## s , for ex## ample regard## ing translat## ion and legal assist## ance . 
we often have to make compromis## es , including one## s that are per## hap## s not al## ways satisfactory , for ex## ample on the linguist## ic front . 
with enlarge## ment and increas## ing legisl## ative activity , we need access to ad## vice , as well as to stu## dies , consult## ations and analyse## s . 
it is now Parliament that is people &apos;## s window onto joint legisl## ation , and we must there## fore demand conditio## ns that ensu## re we can do legisl## ative work of the proper qual## ity . 
the 20## 05 budget appropriate## s EUR 1## 7.5 million to an increas## e in MEP## s &quot; remune## ration for the purpose of appoint## ing staff . 
MEP## s are ex## peri## enc## ing an increas## ing burden of work as a result not on## ly of the increas## ing legisl## ative work but also of enlarge## ment . 
the legisl## ation on which we work is ver## y often technical## ly complic## ated environment## al and commercial legisl## ation , and we there## fore require support in our work . 
that is why it is also on## ly fair that MEP## s be give## n high## er remune## ration s## o that we can appoint staff and , equal## ly to the point , do s## o under reason## able work## ing conditio## ns . 
the amount concern## ed ha## s be## en plac## ed in reserv## e while we await## ed a decision . 
the decision ha## s now be## en ma## de ; clear rule## s in a number of area## s have be## en adopt## ed ; and the Committee on Budget## s will thu## s be able next year to adopt a position on re## mov## ing the reserv## e in the light of a re## quest by Parliament &apos;## s President . 
final## ly , I should like to say thank you for your construct## ive co## operation on this budget procedure . 
I would particular## ly thank Mr## s Grybauskaite , our Commission## er , who was ver## y active in bring## ing about a compromis## e on the budget . 
I would also thank the Council &apos;## s negoti## ator , Mr Nicolaï , and the rapporteur , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , who I think have ma## de fantas## tic contribut## ions to the budget procedure . 
last but not least , I would thank my colleague## s , the co## ordinator## s , for the## ir construct## ive co## operation on the budget . 
. Mr President , Commission## er , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , lad## ies and gentle## men , this year &apos;## s mobil## isation of the flexibil## ity instrument is close## ly connect## ed with the success of the Budget consult## ations and the agree## ment that we conclude## d - as we in## de## ed need## ed to - between the institution## s . 
let me say , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , in retrospect , how good it is that at that time , in 19## 99 , Parliament secure## d this flexibil## ity instrument follow## ing laborious negoti## ations , for it ha## s be## en ver## y much to the benefit of the Council &apos;## s priorit## ies when implement## ing past year## s &quot; Budget## s . 
let me o## nce again remind you that the flexibil## ity instrument , the annual upper limit of which the May 19## 99 agree## ment set at EUR 200 million , is intend## ed to deal with un## foresee## n eventual## ities , and also that head## ing 24 of the Inter## institutional Agreement states that , as a rule , this flexibil## ity instrument should not be appli## ed for one and the same purpose in two success## ive financial year## s . 
be## fore this flexibil## ity instrument is ma## de use of , there does of course have to be a motion to that effect , and there ha## s to be examin## ation of whet## her new un## foresee## n measure## s are to be fund## ed with## in a head## ing or , where this is im## possible , by shift## s between one head## ing and an## other , which is to be follow## ed by discuss## ion of whet## her the flexibil## ity instrument is to be appli## ed . 
we go through this procedure al## most every year , and what we have actual## ly learn## ed from the experience is that the interpret## ation put on this flexibil## ity ha## s some## time## s plac## ed it under some consider## able s## train . 
I would draw attention to this year &apos;## s result , which is that we have EUR 18## 5 million at our dispos## al , EUR 45 million for the Peace II programme , EUR 40 million for the age## ncies - which are obvi## ously a## mong the Council &apos;## s re## ally import## ant priorit## ies and are al## ways threaten## ing to displace import## ant programme## s in head## ing III , which yield add## ed value for Europe - and EUR 1## 00 million for the re## construct## ion of Iraq . 
it is with specific reference to this that I want to point out that , in the current 20## 04 Budget , out of a total of EUR 90 million for Iraq , EUR 74 million have - as I recall - al## read## y be## en fund## ed in 20## 04 with the aid of the flexibil## ity instrument . 
that manifest## ly border## s on the in## defens## ible . as a rule , that should not be done . 
for that reason , I believ## e we would be ver## y well advis## ed , in the debate on the new Fina## ncial Perspective and the flexibil## ity it call## s for , to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibil## ity instrument over the past year## s . 
let me take this opportun## ity to say that we are talk## ing here , over## all , in term## s of payment## s from the 20## 05 Budget of EUR 10## 6.## 3 billion and EUR 200 million allow## ed for flexibil## ity . 
what is interest## ing about this year is that , for the first time , not on## ly does head## ing IV - foreign policy - benefit from the use of the flexibil## ity instrument , but also head## ing## s II and III necess## arily benefit from what we have negotiate## d . 
the ultimate result of this , and what might be call## ed an additional result , is that the Agreement ha## s also ma## de it possible - in a sort of legal / budget## ary emerge## ncy operation - to in## corporate EUR 1## 20 million worth of fund## ing for North## ern Cyprus under head## ing VI## I and to add EUR 10 million to the fund## ing for the common foreign and securit## y policy , bring## ing it up to EUR 6## 2.5 million . 
. 
Mr President , I am pleas## ed that our two institution## s reach## ed a global agree## ment on the budget of the Union for next year d## uring the conciliation meet## ing on 25 N## ov## ember . 
follow## ing your delibe## rations today , allow me to make a few remark## s in this con## text . 
as you know , the Council had not initial## ly foresee## n the use of the flexibil## ity instrument . 
in our global compromis## e the Council had to accept it## s use for a substanti## al amount - EUR 18## 5 million - and this was not greet## ed with enthusiasm by all Member State## s . 
be## cause of budget## ary disciplin## e , the Council is of the opinion that cho## ice## s have to be ma## de , just as , at national level , one can## not simpl## y add up all priorit## ies and expect the bill to be paid . 
having s## aid that , in prepar## ation for the conciliation meet## ing , the Council listen## ed care## fully to Parliament &apos;## s argument## s . 
Parliament ma## de it clear from the start that it would not be able to finance it## s tradition## al priorit## ies and it## s new priorit## ies in Head## ing## s 3 and 4 , Inter## nal and External Poli## cies , under the exist## ing ceil## ing## s . 
with the agree## ments on the use of the flexibil## ity instrument in Head## ing 3 , Parliament is in the position to restore the fund## ing for the age## ncies . 
at the same time Parliament ha## s secure## d sufficient fund## ing for it## s priorit## ies . 
as regard## s the use of the flexibil## ity instrument in Head## ing 4 , I can agree with the draft## s## man of the opinion of Parliament &apos;## s Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s that the out## come can be seen as quit## e posit## ive for Parliament . 
I also want to mention the peace process in North## ern Ireland . 
I am pleas## ed that we we## re able to agree on the financ## ing of the Peace II programme for 20## 05 @## -## @ 06 . 
we are making a valu## able contribut## ion to a long @## -## @ term solution . 
final## ly , the Parliament &apos;## s delegation ma## de it possible to reach agree## ment by mode## rating the demand## s on payment appropri## ations . 
we have a balance## d result , which the Commission say## s is work## able . 
I look forward to the sign## ing ceremony on Thursday . 
. 
Mr President , I am ver## y pleas## ed to s## peak to you today , the first en## counter for the new Commission in this ver## y import## ant exerc## ise , start## ing on 22 N## ov## ember , which direct## ly concern## s the negoti## ations on the 20## 05 budget : a ver## y import## ant issue for Parliament and for Europe . 
after fair## ly tough negoti## ations on 25 N## ov## ember , when bo## th branch## es of the budget## ary author## ity show## ed s## kill and flexibil## ity , we reach## ed a final agree## ment on a tight budget for 20## 05 . 
Parliament &apos;## s solid## arity and de## termination allow## ed it to achiev## e all the import## ant go## al## s it had set it## self . 
the Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s , Mr Lewandow## ski ; the budget rapporteur , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o ; Mr## s J## ens## en , the rapporteur on the flexibil## ity instrument ; Mr Böge , and other member## s of the Committee on Budget## s who particip## ated ver## y close## ly in all @## -## @ day and all @## -## @ night negoti## ations deserve thank## s from all of us for the hard @## -## @ won result## s . 
the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr Nicolaï , also deserve## s our praise for having encourag## ed Member State## s to accept the agree## ment : not an e## asy task . 
in the final agree## ment there will , of course , be some risk that not all com## pul## s## ory expend## iture is cover## ed in what was decide## d in the package . 
accord## ing to update## d estimate## s from the Committee on Agri## culture , for ex## ample , some expend## iture was ignor## ed by the Council : extra call## s for payment## s for the structural fund## s or action## s d## uring the year could be necess## ary . 
but I am satisfied that we agree## d a joint decla## ration on payment appropri## ations for structural action## s that can allow a rapid s## ing## le @## -## @ read## ing decision on a possible amend## ing budget for extra payment## s if the Commission ident## ifies the need in mid @## -## @ 20## 05 . 
I call on bo## th budget## ary author## ities to react quick## ly if there appear## s to be a need to propos## e this . 
the same will also app## ly to com## pul## s## ory expend## iture on agri## culture . 
we also want to emphasis## e that , as mention## ed be## fore , for the first time the flexibil## ity instrument is be## ing us## ed above the ceil## ing## s in three head## ing## s and we agree## d to use the total amount of EUR 18## 5 million for this instrument . 
I am not going to emphasis## e the detail## s of the over## all package , which ha## s be## en ver## y well describ## ed , or the main agree## ments we reach## ed . 
I would like to draw attention to what is import## ant for us and is al## ways import## ant for Parliament , name## ly im## prov## ing deliver## y . 
e## ach year Parliament seek## s to use the budget process to support the Commission &apos;## s ef## fort## s to improve deliver## y , which we are happy to accept . 
the Commission &apos;## s letter on implement## ability ha## s the same in## tent . 
we have fulfill## ed the re## quest ma## de at first read## ing and you con## sequent## ly re## lease## d man## y of the reserv## es . 
I thank you for that . 
Parliament is concern## ed about the way non @## -## @ state actor## s and international organisation## s are us## ing European Union fund## s . 
the Commission will produce a report by April 20## 05 examin## ing these issue## s . 
you have maintain## ed a reserv## e for the financ## ing of 50 new post## s from the sever## al hundred re## quest## ed . 
I hope to introduce a transfer re## quest in Janu## ary to lift the reserv## e on these post## s , since I believ## e the conditio## ns have be## en fulfill## ed . 
you ask for the rule## s to be change## d on the financial regulation . 
I under## take that the Commission will bring forward propos## al## s to mod## ify the financial regulation by spring 20## 05 , and the Commission ha## s al## read## y introduce## d propos## al## s to mod## ify the implement## ing rule## s . 
the Council is read## y to give it## s opinion . we await Parliament &apos;## s view## s . 
I will look again at your re## quest for support for even## ts and pilot action## s . 
not all of them are feasible , but the new political situ## ation may provid## e new open## ing## s and I will communic## ate my thought## s on that to you in Janu## ary . 
the Commission thank## s you o## nce again for your fair and firm negoti## ations and for your will## ing## ness to seek a compromis## e . 
I congratul## ate you all on the great success that you have achiev## ed . 
I take this opportun## ity to wish you the compliment## s of the season and look forward to the final vot## e on Thursday . 
I thank the Commission## er and would like to take this opportun## ity to wish her all the best in her work as part of the Commission . 
. 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the creation of a real European area of free## dom , securit## y and justice quit## e clear## ly constitut## es one of the fundamental political priorit## ies of the European Union and a major pre## occupation for all European citizen## s . 
this is why I wish first of all to thank my colleague## s on the Committee on Budget## s , and in particular our general rapporteur , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , for support## ing and put## ting to the vot## e in this House most of the amend## ments submit## ted by the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s . 
of these , sever## al are aim## ed specific## ally at strength## ening the European Union &apos;## s capacity to combat terrorism . 
this involve## s , , an increas## e in Euro## just &apos;## s oper## ating appropri## ations and the inclus## ion of a pilot project in the budget intend## ed to enhance co## ordination , through## out the EU , of the resource## s and activities for prevent## ing and combat## ing terrorist threat## s . 
we have also propos## ed measure## s to strength## en the ways in which all European## s show solid## arity with the victim## s of terrorist act## s . 
of the other priorit## ies , I should like o## nce again to high## light two of them , which are in our view of particular significance . 
we propos## e , Commission## er , to hold in reserv## e the bulk of the appropri## ations re## quest## ed on pass## enger## s &quot; right## s . 
we are aware of the disagree## ment between Parliament and the Commission as regard## s the level of protection for the personal data that the air## line## s have to provid## e to the American custom## s author## ities . 
if we vot## e for the propos## ed amend## ment , the appropri## ations will remain froze## n for as long as the Commission fail## s to propos## e an active ra## ther th## an passive system for the trans## mission of data , as it ha## s under## take## n to do sever## al time## s and as Parliament ha## s ask## ed it to do . 
second## ly , and I particular## ly address these remark## s to the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , we propos## e to hold in reserv## e all of the appropri## ations earmark## ed for the External B## order## s Ag## ency . 
in order to be operation## al and effective , Mr President , this Ag## ency need## s head## quarter## s - per## man## ent head## quarter## s . 
we ask the Council to establish s## uch head## quarter## s ur## gent## ly and prefer## ably be## fore the end of this year . 
Mr President , you have al## read## y settle## d man## y problem## s and I think you are cap## able of settling this one be## fore leav## ing office . 
thank you in advance . 
. Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I would like to start by thank## ing our three rapporteur## s for the excel## lent work the## y have done , in which I also include the Chair## man of our Committee and , of course , the staff of the Committee &apos;## s secretariat , who have provid## ed us Member## s with the inform## ation we need## ed to stand our ground again## st a shrewd Council . 
our negoti## ations , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , have of course left an after## taste , and about that I would like to s## peak in ver## y plain term## s . 
it go## es with## out say## ing that the European Union need## s to save money . 
we have to draw up a tight budget , and we have to be respons## ible in our hand## ling of the money that the public have paid in tax , but the question form## ing it## self in my mind is whet## her it is one of the task## s of the annual Budget procedure to put forward ever more re## con## d## ite propos## al## s for a Budget when you know al## read## y that there will be a supplement## ary Budget next year ? 
s## uch is not a cred## ible approach . 
in non## e of the 25 Member State## s - let me make this abundant## ly clear - would the national parliament toler## ate s## uch a way of going about thing## s . 
second## ly , I ask you to try to rein in your fellow minister## s in the foreign affair## s depart## ments and in all the other special## ism## s . 
I am anticip## ating the negoti## ations to which Mr Böge ha## s refer## red when I say that there is no pleas## ure in lay## ing down upper limit## s by way of the Fina## ncial Perspective when it is ap## parent to every## one involve## d that the figure## s are not## ional and will n## ever - it is to be hop## ed - be reach## ed . 
there I would ask you to be more honest . 
al## most EUR 5 billion separat## es us from the upper limit of Ag## enda 20## 00 - in the wrong direct## ion ! 
s## o pleas## e let us , when consider## ing agri## cultural policy , talk about how much money we re## ally need , ra## ther th## an - as the Commission## er ha## s just s## aid that s## he will need a supplement## ary and amend## ing Budget - lay## ing down the amount## s via the Budget procedure . 
let us not promise our## selves any## thing where the ten new countries are concern## ed , and th## en , if we want the 1.0 % Budget that we obsess about , we will be able to save . 
that is not on## ly what I ask for , but also the less## on that I have learn## ed from these negoti## ations . 
al## though we have achiev## ed much together , all these negoti## ations now need to be address## ed with a bit more serious## ness . 
. 
Commission## er , Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , lad## ies and gentle## men , it is now my turn to thank all th## ose involve## d in the budget on which we s## hall be vot## ing in two days &quot; time : Mr## s J## ens## en , Mr Gar## ri## ga , Mr Böge and also all th## ose who have be## en work## ing with us . 
o## nce again , I wish to express how baffle## d I am at the method us## ed for pro## duc## ing the budget and e## special## ly , for this second read## ing , at the mann## er in which our dia## logue was held with the Council d## uring N## ov## ember . 
it is tru## e that we have reach## ed an agree## ment and achiev## ed result## s , but di## d it re## ally need twelve hour## s to arriv## e at what should have be## en achiev## able by mean## s of real method## s of dia## logue ra## ther th## an a set of people who di## d real damage to the content of the budget ? 
we have now reach## ed payment appropri## ations of 1.0## 5 % of G## DP , which is above the mile## stone of 1 % . 
in return , how## ever , we have obtain## ed an un## hop## ed @## -## @ for result for the flexibil## ity instrument that will allow us to finance our priorit## ies in the short term thank## s to an agree## ment on Head## ing 2 . 
we actual## ly feel that obtain## ing this result was extreme## ly import## ant , albeit high## ly un## satisfactory in the long run . 
at a time when we are negoti## ating the next financial perspective## s , we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European poli## cies and the Council &apos;## s re## tic## ence d## uring these negoti## ations lead## s me to believ## e that , if we s## peak of a ceil## ing in the negoti## ations , Parliament should also provid## e for the con## cept of a floor bene## ath which a European budget make## s no sense . 
setting payment appropri## ations in stone while mov## ing away from commit## ment appropri## ations is a usual strate## gy of the Council , but this is a strange course of action at a time when every## one - whet## her in the privat## e sector or the public sector - is be## ing ask## ed to ensu## re trans## par## ency , reli## ability and truth when read## ing the budget figure## s . 
this can## not continu## e and the Union must be as strict with it## self as it is with other## s . 
this situ## ation en## able## d us to re## lease the invest## ments that we want## ed in the ver## y short term and my colleague## s will s## peak to you about this . 
we also hope - and I am address## ing the Commission at this point - that we s## hall see ver## y good budget implement## ation this year , e## special## ly in the field of inform## ation and communic## ation with the citizen## s . 
like you , Commission## er , I hope that this year we s## hall make progress on the problem of setting up and implement## ing pilot project## s , s## o that we are better able to meet our soci## ety &apos;## s expect## ations . 
final## ly , I am going to take a few minute## s to say that one budget head## ing perplex## ed us . 
I turn this time to## ward## s my colleague## s to say that , when we agree## d to vot## e for the package on special even## ts , we we## re entire## ly in agree## ment that the con## cept of European secular## ism should be fully implement## ed . 
you ga## ve us your word that World You## th Day in Co## log## ne is to be character## ised by respect for other culture## s and philosoph## ies and that European money is to be us## ed in an entire## ly secular way ; you know , as I do , that we s## hall be watch## ing care## fully . 
the adopt## ion of the other institution## s &quot; budget## s , which took place with## out any problem## s , lead## s me simpl## y to say that we must review our expend## iture here be## cause , by im## posing sever## e restrict## ions on our expend## iture , we have end## ed up im## posing limit## ations on our## selves and deni## ed our## selves resource## s for work## ing and exerc## ising our power and our privilege## s with respect to the other institution## s . 
in conclusion , I should like simpl## y to say that this budget will certain## ly be implement## ed with## out any great problem in 20## 05 , but that it is a transit## ional budget , which does not provid## e any real mean## s of ens## uring continu## ity and this is what is worry## ing us great## ly . 
non## e## the## less , I think that Mr Pitt## ella will be able to take up the gauntlet even though this method can## not last and might hinder us in the futur## e from achiev## ing budget## s to match our political project## s . 
. 
Mr President , the EU budget for 20## 05 is now at second read## ing in Parliament . 
I wish to thank the rapporteur## s , Salv## ador Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o and Ann## e J## ens## en , for the## ir excel## lent work . 
I wish , like## wise , to thank the Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s , Mr Lewandow## ski , for hi## s ster## ling leader## ship of the committee and Commission## er Grybauskaitė and Mr Nicolaï , represent## ing the Council , for the## ir construct## ive co## operation . 
the EU budget for 20## 05 may well meet next year &apos;## s need## s , but there are question mark## s over it . 
there was much wrangl## ing over payment appropri## ations , which look## ed as if the## y we## re going to be too small . 
out## standing commit## ments at present are about to reach the EUR 1## 00 billion mark , of which approximate## ly EUR 70 billion represent## s the Struct## ural Fund## s . 
the poor level## s of implement## ation of the budget in re## cent year## s have now creat## ed a back## log . 
right to the end , the Council want## ed to limit payment appropri## ations . 
it took much ef## fort to bring payment## s up to the level of EUR 10## 6.## 3 billion , which is s## till EUR 7## .9 billion be## low the financial perspective . 
that , how## ever , is EUR 500 billion , or more th## an 1 % of the EU &apos;## s G## DP . 
this budget ceil## ing propos## ed by six Member State## s thu## s haunt## ed the conciliation meet## ing . 
even the Council , how## ever , doubt## ed the adequacy of the financ## ing by adopt## ing the joint re## solution which propos## ed that any supplement## ary budget re## l## ating to the Struct## ural Fund## s should , if possible , be adopt## ed at one read## ing . 
the statement run## s contr## ary to good budget## ary policy as the budget ha## s to include all known expend## iture for the financial year . 
it should be mention## ed that at the same conciliation meet## ing it was agree## d to increas## e the payment appropri## ations in the Struct## ural Fund## s this year by EUR 3.7 billion , be## cause fund## s have run out . 
of this , EUR 2 billion was new money . 
in the budget debate , the issue of the rapid rise in the number of Ag## encies in the European Union was ra## ised . 
next year there will be 23 of them , of which f## ive will be new . 
EUR 40 million from the flexibil## ity instrument had to be spent to meet the## ir administ## rative cost## s , or else there would have be## en no financ## ing avail## able . 
in re## cent time## s , a lot of Ag## encies have be## en set up as a result of trade between Member State## s . 
in 20## 00 there we## re s## till on## ly seven Ag## encies . 
we should there## fore take prompt action to discover whet## her the Ag## encies are the most effective way to develop the EU &apos;## s administ## ration . 
it might be that this way we are establish## ing unit## s that are hard to monitor and which are partial## ly respons## ible for creat## ing nothing more th## an a double layer of bureau## cracy . 
an## other question is present## ed by the vari## ous associ## ations and organisation## s that are grant## ed appropri## ations direct## ly out of the budget . 
these earmark## ed s## um## s are actual## ly again## st the financial regulation . 
we believ## e the system to be bas## ed on favour## it## ism , which mud## dies the ground## s for financial support , making them un## clear . 
Parliament should remain a legisl## ative body and leave implement## ation task## s to the Commission , which would be the best way of monitor## ing im## partial## ity . 
. Mr President , Commission## er Grybauskaitė , Mr Nicolaï , lad## ies and gentle## men , we may , today , be discuss## ing the agree## ment with the Council about the 20## 05 Budget , but we are , of course , al## read## y look## ing to see how thing## s will progress with the 20## 06 Budget and what is to be expect## ed in the coming year## s in relation to the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
s## o I will tell you in plain language that my political evalu## ation of the result we have achiev## ed for 20## 05 make## s me bo## th laugh and cry . 
what I see as posit## ive is the flexibil## ity instrument . 
I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr Böge , who ma## de it ver## y clear that we have succeed## ed in making these fund## s avail## able now - not on## ly for internal policy and the age## ncies , but also for foreign policy , above all for support## ing the elect## ions in Iraq . 
that is a success , and it was one that we in this House saw as ur## gent## ly necess## ary if we we## re to be equal to all the task## s set us . 
I see it as in## dispens## able that we we## re able to uphold as part of the Lisbon strate## gy our priorit## y of upgrad## ing inform## ation policy , en## ab## ling us better to reach the citizen## s and vot## ers in Europe . 
we Green## s also see it as import## ant progress that the LI## F## E programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have be## en prevent## ed from fall## ing by the way## side . 
I would , how## ever , like to say with equal clar## ity that what I see in a negat## ive light is the shape take## n by the payment## s for 20## 05 . 
we do , admitted## ly , conclude that this round of negoti## ations di## d not offer more room for manoeuvr## e ; that is why we will vot## e in favour of this Budget . 
I am right be## hind Mr Ferber in hi## s critic## ism## s of the Council and in hi## s statement describ## ing the 1 % crite## r## ion as mis## guide## d fet## ish## ism on the part of the Council . 
I want to make that ver## y plain to you , as I was ver## y pleas## ed to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr Ferber and I are of one mind . 
the fact is that I do believ## e - and here I am address## ing you , Mr Nicolaï - that you stated , not on## ly in the course of our negoti## ations d## uring the conciliation procedure , but also in this House today , that this House , in exact## ly the same way as the national govern## ments , must be will## ing to decide on priorit## ies . 
that is in## de## ed s## o . 
my fellow MEP## s have also al## read## y s## aid that we all have a great interest in budget## ary disciplin## e and a serious approach to the Budget . 
in the same way , though , you can## not evad## e our question , for if we have to set priorit## ies , the same must also be s## aid of the national govern## ments . 
your belief that you have to make unilateral cut## s in which European policy lose## s out I regard as the wrong approach . 
politic## s risk## s be## ing re## nationalise## d , and , for an enlarge## d Europe - for , for the first time , we are deal## ing with a Budget for 25 Member State## s - with new task## s and new challenge## s , that would be a mistake . 
if you want to fashion a tru## ly European policy , you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that . 
I do not at present see that in the position of the net contribut## ing countries and in the obsess## ion with 1 % . that I regard as a mistake in political term## s . 
if we want to join together in further develop## ing our wonder## ful continent , if we want to do more for economic renew## al , for spend## ing on educ## ation , youth and new talent## s , th## en joint## ly , and together with you , the Council and the net contribut## or countries - and this is where I am critical of the red / green govern## ment in Germa## ny - we must get mov## ing in order to achiev## e more for Europe &apos;## s benefit . 
let me express , by way of conclusion , my grat## itude to all the staff and member## s of the Committee on Budget## s . 
I hope that we will continu## e to work together with s## uch power## ful effect over the year## s to come in order to achiev## e much for Europe . 
. 
Mr President , my group ha## s submit## ted a motion to reject the 20## 05 budget and I should like to explain the reason## s for this initiative . 
my group ha## s n## ever argu## ed in favour of a rash increas## e in the Union &apos;## s budget . 
we are commit## ted to the rigor## ous manage## ment of public fund## s and , above all , we do not consider the budget to be the on## ly instrument avail## able to the Union to realis## e it## s ambit## ions . 
in this respect , we wish to high## light , for ex## ample , the need for a fundamental re## orient## ation of the mission## s and operation of the European C## ent## ral Bank . 
it remain## s tru## e , how## ever , that the Union &apos;## s budget reflect## s a political will . 
the stated object## ive## s must be match## ed by sufficient financial resource## s , other## wise the EU &apos;## s ver## y cred## ibility is at risk . 
follow## ing the increas## ing pressure be## ing exert## ed to reduce public expend## iture at all cost in accord## ance with the spirit of the St## ability and G## row## th Pact , we have al## read## y had , in 20## 04 , the low## est budget relativ## e to gross national re## venue since 19## 87 . 
year after year , Parliament ha## s criticise## d this restrict## ive tend## ency , a## long with the laborious budget## ary gymnas## tic## s that accompany it ; s## uch as the increas## ing number## s of transfer## s and amend## ing budget## s ; the reduction in essential appropri## ations , s## uch as th## ose intend## ed for develop## ing countries , to be able to finance new demand## s , for ex## ample the contribut## ion to financ## ing for the re## construct## ion of countries sever## e## ly affect## ed by war , s## uch as the Balkan## s , Afghan## istan and Iraq ; and the misuse of the flexibil## ity instrument . 
every year , Parliament criticise## s this trend and we have again just heard Mr Ferber , Mr## s Gu## y @## -## @ Qu## int and Mr## s Trü## pel echo this dis## satisf## action . 
I propos## e quit## e simpl## y that this should be reflect## ed , this year , not on## ly in word## s , but also in clear and visible action . 
to indic## ate that we final## ly wish to put an end to this system## atic## ally restrict## ive and short @## -## @ sighted policy on the part of the Council is the first reason for submit## ting our motion to reject the 20## 05 budget . 
the second reason for our decision is that next year will be the first full year of the Union of 25 . 
the success of this enlarge## ment assume## s , in our view , that we provid## e a budget sufficient to take on the un## avoid## able cost## s of inter## depend## ence associate## d with this great project , whi## lst ens## uring that this does not involve abandon## ing region## s or population## s in difficult## y in the old Member State## s . 
I should add that the new ef## fort## s , the need for which is accept## ed by every## one , to support employ## ment , educ## ation , train## ing , research and the environment require comm## ensu## rate fund## ing , un## less it is consider## ed that s## uch new ef## fort## s are to be limit## ed to just a few profit## able niche## s and a privilege## d elit## e . 
success## ful enlarge## ment with## out bring## ing the population## s of the new and old Member State## s in## to competit## ion with one an## other - that is the second reason why we table## d our motion to reject a poor draft budget . 
final## ly , 20## 05 will be the decisive year in the attempt to reach agree## ment between the 25 on the financial perspective## s for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
as ha## s al## read## y be## en stated sever## al time## s , a heav## y mill## stone is current## ly weigh## ing these negoti## ations down : the need of the six countries which are net contribut## ors to the Union &apos;## s budget to have this limit## ed in the futur## e to 1 % or 0.## 9 % of gross national re## venue . 
the Commission ha## s drawn attention , quit## e right## ly , to the fact that this would actual## ly mean a s## wing## e## ing cut of more th## an EUR 9 billion in the 20## 07 budget in relation to the pre## ceding financial year . 
where would s## uch drastic reduction## s fall ? 
on the great work## s announce## d with grand pomp and ceremony ? 
on the Struct## ural Fund## s ? 
a li## ttle bit every## where ? 
are we going to be read## y for action when fac## ed with s## uch ir## respons## ible perspective## s ? 
if we we## re to accept with## out a fight a 20## 05 budget set at 1 % of gross national re## venue , would we not be , in some ways , fall## ing in line with the mind## set of the Let## ter of the Six ? 
the thir## d reason why we table## d our motion to reject the 20## 05 budget was to adopt a combat## ive stance in Parliament be## fore it is too late , on the e## ve of the decisive negoti## ations on the financial perspective## s for the year## s to come . 
. 
Mr President , in EU countries about one for## tieth of tax re## venue is spent by EU institution## s . 
in Brit## ain , we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trad## ing with our neighbour## s and for the prosper## ity the EU ha## s br## ought us . 
how## ever , we are begin## ning to recognis## e , as kind## ly confirm## ed by ex @## -## @ Commission## er Kin## nock , that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and co## operate with EU countries and that our prosper## ity might well be high## er if we we## re not in the EU . 
the## y also tell us that the EU budget is small in compar## ison with national budget## s . 
how## ever , national budget## s pay for some use## ful thing## s , s## uch as defence , educ## ation , health care and pension## s . 
the EU budget pay## s for subsid## ies to agri## culture - subsid## ies that agri## culture would function better with## out . 
it pay## s for regional project## s that would other## wise not have be## en consider## ed worth## while . 
it pay## s for poor## ly target## ed over## sea## s development aid . 
it pay## s for auditor## s to find out that 93 % of report## ed spend## ing was un## safe or ridd## led with error## s . 
it pay## s for this Parliament . 
let us stop argu## ing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pur## suit of the Lisbon Ag## enda . 
let us look at the broad## er picture . 
as the last speaker ha## s just s## aid , sever## al countries with the## ir own budget problem## s want a limit of one per cent of G## NI . 
the Commission right## ly point## s out that it must be much large## r if the expect## ations of the new access## ion countries are to be fulfill## ed . 
how much large## r - two per cent , four per cent ? 
if the EU we## re genuine## ly concentr## ating on the ideal## s it keep## s proclaim## ing - peace , prosper## ity , strong econom## ies - it would be acting ver## y different## ly . 
it would not be look## ing at these vari## ous project## s : it would be open## ing it## s market## s proper## ly , internal## ly and external## ly ; it would cease kill## ing off our business## es with thousand## s of ill @## -## @ judge## d pre## script## ive rule## s , and it## s budget could be a small fraction of one per cent of G## DP . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , work on the Union &apos;## s 20## 05 budget is al## most at an end . 
the Commission propos## ed a budget amount## ing to EUR 109 billion , the Council propos## ed a figure of EUR 1## 05 billion and Parliament propos## ed EUR 111 billion . 
the final figure is EUR 1## 06 billion . 
the rapporteur## s must of course be thank## ed for the## ir work , but the question arise## s as to whet## her this amount## s to success and an appropriate compromis## e . 
in fact that is not the most cruc## ial issue at s## take . 
what is much more import## ant is that the out## come is be## low expect## ations . 
I can see other Member## s of this House share my view . 
the policy of cut## s won the day , de## spite enlarge## ment of the Union to take in ten new Member State## s . 
wish## ful think## ing prevail## ed , name## ly that it is possible to have a large## r Union for less money . 
the agree## d level of expend## iture may impact on the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 , and this is even more worry## ing . 
the Union for Europe of the Nation## s Group &apos;## s att## itude to the 20## 05 budget is that it is some## thing that can## not current## ly be oppose## d , but we see no reason for rejoic## ing . 
this is also an opportun## ity for broad## er reflect## ion . 
Georg## e Ken## nan observ## ed in the past that Soviet expansion came about be## cause of an in## ability to solv## e internal problem## s . 
I trust the same will not be tru## e of the European Union . 
un## fortunate## ly , there are some worry## ing similar## ities regard## ing two issue## s , the first of which is economic policy . 
to d## ate , the Union ha## s pursu## ed a policy of cohes## ion and economic solid## arity , help## ing the less @## -## @ develop## ed countries s## o as to promot## e the development of the Member State## s as a whole . 
at present , the con## cept of cohes## ion and economic solid## arity is be## ing written out of Union agree## ments . 
weaken## ing cohes## ion policy or do## ing away with it al## together may lead to differ## ence## s be## coming even more entrench## ed in the futur## e . 
this is e## special## ly like## ly if the Lisbon strate## gy come## s to mean giving up on economic policy , that is , achiev## ing the high## est possible qual## ity at the low## est possible cost , to the benefit of social policy in the more develop## ed countries . 
I refer to protect## ing job## s in th## ose countries burden## ed with excess## ive## ly high social cost## s . 
the second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is un## able to define it## s own ident## ity . 
even## ts concern## ing Mr Butt## igl## ion## e and the fail## ure to integrate Islamic communit## ies in Western Europe , as refer## red to re## cent## ly in , are bo## th relev## ant ex## ample## s## as is the question of the text of the preamble## to the Constitution . 
at the same time , we are continu## ing to debate enlarge## ment to include Tur## key , with## out taking any account of the fundamental issue## s divid## ing the Union from Tur## key . 
the former include social , economic , political and cultural problem## s . 
the respons## e to the conflict between the the## ory of universal standard## s and particular one## s ha## s be## en to do away with standard## s of all kind## s . 
th## ose determine## d to go to any length## s to achiev## e a federal Europe with## out border## s , lack## ing ideo## logical ident## ity and cohes## ion policy , are acting to the detriment of the Union . 
the## y are work## ing slow## ly but more s## ure## ly again## st it th## an th## ose who current## ly wish to harm the Union with extremis## t language . 
there can on## ly be one conclusion , name## ly that in futur## e , the Union must come up with a broad## er ideo## logical ident## ity and make more resource## s avail## able , s## o as to implement cohes## ion and solid## arity policy effective## ly . 
( S## K ) Thank you . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , pleas## e allow me to pick up on my colleague Mr Ro## s## z## kow## ski &apos;## s word## s and present a few fact## s and figure## s . 
for the year 20## 05 the Commission ha## s come up with a draft level of payment## s of EUR 109 billion , in it## s first read## ing the Council ha## s come up with EUR 1## 05 billion , and Parliament ha## s calculate## d payment## s at EUR 111 billion . 
this creat## es an impress## ion of competent activity . 
in the second round the Council ha## s come to us with a draft level of payment## s again at EUR 10## 5.3 billion while Parliament propos## es EUR 10## 6.## 3 billion , which is about 5 billion less th## an in the first round . 
it is total## ly obvi## ous who is taking the lead in this game of budget## ary ping @## -## @ pong , but it is also clear that the budget## ary procedure## s are s## till not precise## ly define## d . 
if the propos## ed level of payment## s is pass## ed by Parliament it will represent an increas## e of 6.5 % compar## ed to 20## 04 . 
in compar## ison with the project## ed level of inflation in the Euro## zone , this is a modest rise , but when set a## long## side the need to finance the political go## al## s and priorit## ies of the European Union there seem to be few## er reason## s for optim## ism . 
as long as the qual## ity crite## r## ion for the budget## ary process of the European Union is the bring## ing together of the level## s of contribut## ions and payment## s , it is ra## ther a reason for pessim## ism . 
a coup## le of days ago , the European Parliament approve## d the annual report of the Court of Audit## ors for the financial year 20## 03 . 
in the parliament## ary discuss## ion about this report there was agree## ment about one of the key conclusion## s , name## ly that the draw @## -## @ down level of credit payment## s or the implement## ation of the payment## s was ra## ther low and for a long period ha## s h## over## ed between 80 and 90 % . 
in this respect the draft budget for the year 20## 05 does not bring any turn## a## round as it suggest## s an implement## ation level for payment## s of 90 % . 
as far as the structural fund## s are concern## ed , the lever## s for implement## ing budget## ary resource## s in the form of the payment## s are in the hand## s of the govern## ments of the EU Member State## s . 
it is there## fore an import## ant role of Parliament to use it## s political instrument## s and to gain the support of the media in exert## ing appropriate pressure on the govern## ments and the Council in order to make full## er and more effective use of the dispos## able resource## s to finance the common poli## cies of the European Union . 
if this does not happen , the parliament## ary budget## ary procedure will continu## e to be more a test of the loyal## ity of Member## s of the European Parliament to the govern## ments of the## ir home countries ra## ther th## an a test of the effective## ness and competitive## ness of the budget## ary process and the use of European Union resource## s . 
thank you . 
we will now hear the other speaker## s on today &apos;## s list , with Mr Sala## franc## a Sánchez @## -## @ Neyra to s## peak first . 
I would like to apolog## ise to him for a small error in the order of s## peak## ing , which we manage## d to put right with hi## s help and that of Mr Lewandow## ski . 
. 
Mr President , I believ## e that , in fact , Parliament &apos;## s Rule## s of Procedure establish that , follow## ing the rapporteur## s of the committee respons## ible for the main report , it is normal## ly the draft## s## men of the opinion## s of the relev## ant committee## s who take the floor . 
having s## aid that , Mr President , I would like to thank you for your courtesy and congratul## ate the general rapporteur for the budget , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , on the excel## lent work he ha## s done and also on the way he ha## s hand## led the negoti## ations with the Council and the Commission . 
with regard to head## ing 4 , we have fac## ed the problem## s that tradition## ally arise in that chap## ter , this year with the EUR 200 million for Iraq , as the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council ha## s point## ed out . 
we have be## en able to find a satisfactory solution , but in any e## vent , we believ## e that the solution propos## ed by the Commission would have be## en better be## cause that would have sav## ed us cut## s in head## ing 4 in the s## um of EUR 15 million . 
I believ## e that Mr Böge &apos;## s comment## s are absolut## e## ly right , that is to say , we can## not take on new commit## ments every year at the expense of the European Union &apos;## s tradition## al external action priorit## ies . 
we must rational## ise the use of the flexibil## ity instrument , which is govern## ed by certain rule## s which must be respect## ed for the sake of the cred## ibility of our European Union project ; in term## s of the review of the coming financial perspective## s , s## ure## ly we will be able to reach an agree## ment on the solution to this issue . 
Mr President , I would also like to thank the draft## s## man of the opinion of the Committee on Develop## ment , Mr Wijk## man , for hi## s excel## lent co## operation and hi## s will## ing## ness at all time## s to find solution## s which are compatible with the priorit## ies of hi## s committee and the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s . 
I would like to take this opportun## ity to wish the Commission## er luck in her du## ties and ask her to facilit## ate our work by not taking on commit## ments which have no budget## ary support , be## cause I believ## e that , by taking that approach , we will be able to co## operate more effective## ly in relation to the object## ive that inspir## es us all . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , difficult negoti## ations have conclude## d with a credit## able result . 
for this we should thank the rapporteur## s , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o and Mr## s J## ens## en , all the political group## s and the new Commission## er , who ha## s give## n us valu## able help and who## s## e good wish## es I glad## ly recipro## cate . 
the agree## ment can be seen as satisfactory to Parliament be## cause it bring## s with it man## y posit## ive out## come## s . 
it ha## s be## en a difficult pass## age , but we have go## t through it , and have obtain## ed fund## ing for re## construct## ion in Iraq , the main## ten## ance of tradition## al geo## graphic## al poli## cies , fund## s for SME## s , inform## ation and research as well as resource## s for the age## ncies . 
also enter## ed in the budget are resource## s for the structural fund## s and pilot project## s , some of which are ver## y interest## ing , s## uch as Erasmus for apprentice## s and the pilot project## s on conflict prevent## ion and on small arm## s reduction . 
we can## not , how## ever , pronounce our## selves satisfied with the way in which the chap## ter on payment appropri## ations was conclude## d . 
I am well aware that this is not the fault of either Parliament or the Commission , which in fact help## ed us and press## ed as hard as it could . 
how## ever , the stone @## -## @ cold in## flexibil## ity with which the Council s## tuck by the 1 % is worthy of a better cause and does not augur well either for negoti## ations on the Fina## ncial Perspective or for the next budget , for which I hope that it will be possible to achiev## e more ambitious and grat## ifying go## al## s , as Mr## s Gu## y @## -## @ Qu## int also s## aid . 
we have gone a li## ttle beyond the 1 % mark . 
it was right to give this signal , as Parliament will not accept a Fina## ncial Perspective which force## s the Union to for## sake it## s own task## s and du## ties , which are enshrine## d in the treat## ies . 
peculiar idea## s are circul## ating and some## time## s a kind of psycho## logical bul## ly## ing is also us## ed to## ward## s the new Member State## s to make them maintain the s## o @## -## @ call## ed rigor## ous line . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , rigour consist## s in trans## parent , effective and efficient administ## ration , but it does not mean re## fusing to act with the leader## ship expect## ed by European citizen## s . 
Article 158 of the Treat## y affirm## s that economic and social cohes## ion policy is one of Europe &apos;## s main task## s . 
any## one think## ing of par## ed @## -## @ down budget## s , of re## duc## ing and concentr## ating the structural fund## s on certain area## s on## ly , of re## national## ising the cohes## ion policy and depriv## ing the Lisbon strate## gy of the requisite resource## s should be aware right now that the## y will be met with the firm op## position of this Parliament . 
Mr President , as the represent## ative of my political group , I have be## en follow## ing the budget debate in the Committee on Budget## s since the spring . 
I am s## ure that bo## th rapporteur## s have done the## ir ver## y best , but , de## spite that , my group is propos## ing the budget be reject## ed for the reason## s of policy that our Chair## man , Francis Wurtz , mention## ed at the start of the s## itt## ing . 
the problem from Parliament &apos;## s point of view is budget## ary disciplin## e , which does not recognis## e flexibil## ity to any adequate ex## tent . 
string## ent budget## ary disciplin## e is supplement## ed by an inter## institutional agree## ment , which was smuggle## d through the European Parliament in May , 19## 99 . 
the pre## vi## ous Parliament was un## able , as is the current one , to have an influence on the ceil## ing## s for appropri## ations determine## d in the inter## institutional agree## ment . 
the on## ly way to creat## e more flexibil## ity would have be## en to terminate the inter## institutional agree## ment that came about in s## uch strange circum## stance## s , but Parliament ha## s not be## en prepar## ed to do that , in spite of the fact that the in## flexibil## ity of the budget ha## s be## en common knowledge . 
this lack of flexibil## ity is in the Council &apos;## s interest## s , but not Parliament &apos;## s . 
I would , how## ever , like to thank the Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s , and the rapporteur## s and co## ordinator## s , for the## ir excel## lent level## s of co## operation , even though my group ha## s decide## d to propos## e that the budget be reject## ed . 
Mr President , in my speech I would like to touch upon the issue of the budget allocate## d for the require## ments of the common foreign and securit## y policy . 
a coup## le of deca## de## s ago there we## re al## read## y predict## ions that the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury would be a time of increas## ed risk## s and threat## s . 
again## st this back## ground the European Union &apos;## s wish to promot## e st## ability not on## ly in Europe , but also to achiev## e great## er influence more general## ly in world securit## y process## es is ver## y import## ant . 
this is confirm## ed by the European Union &apos;## s declare## d wish and grow## ing ability to be able to particip## ate in conflict prevent## ion and cris## is manage## ment activities - and of course the challenge## s are not decreas## ing . 
it is anticip## ated that in the near futur## e the number of civil cris## is manage## ment operation## s will double . 
special## ists are discuss## ing possible operation## s in Iraq , Sudan and the Con## go . 
maintain## ing a s## table situ## ation in the European Union &apos;## s neighbour## ing countries is no less import## ant . 
it is worth mention## ing Georgia and the operation## s in the countries of the Balkan region . 
let us not forget that threat## s of terrorism in## side the European Union are a real possibil## ity . 
measure## s to combat the spread of weapon## s of mass destruct## ion are s## till import## ant . 
Europe &apos;## s institutional capacities in the sphere of cris## is manage## ment need to be develop## ed . 
there## fore , it is ver## y clear that the trend of the activities of the European Union &apos;## s common foreign and securit## y policy is inevit## ably up## ward## s . 
see## ing the amount of resource## s allocate## d for these measure## s in the budget for 20## 05 , how## ever , give## s cause for concern about the dis## crep## ancy between Europe &apos;## s political ambit## ions and the financial resource## s avail## able to ful## fil these ambit## ions . 
the in## sufficiency of resource## s need## ed to success## fully achiev## e Europe &apos;## s securit## y strate## gy is often discuss## ed a## mong## st special## ists in the institution with## in the relev## ant field## s . 
certain## ly , one should welcome the fact that at second read## ing the European Parliament ha## s allott## ed 10 million more for need## s th## an at first read## ing . 
how## ever , even th## en it is not possible to understand the tactic## al reason## s which led Parliament &apos;## s Budget## ary Control Committee to allocate EUR 10 million less at first read## ing for the need## s of co## ordinating these import## ant go## al## s . 
un## fortunate## ly , in order to prevent this erroneous approach by the European Parliament , it was necess## ary to put the conciliation procedure in## to effect . 
Mr President , listen in on this debate , and you hear the cry of &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more , &quot; &apos; more &quot; on every side . 
I , too , am in favour of &apos; more , &quot; but of more efficiency and trans## par## ency , whet## her we are talk## ing about the Lisbon strate## gy or securit## y policy . 
after all , we would have the money if we we## re , o## nce and for all , to tackle the huge sacr## ed cow## s that lurk in the Parliament## ary budget and , of course , particular## ly in this enormous Budget , which run## s to hundred## s of billion## s of euro## s . 
let me just make two point## s about it . 
trans## par## ency would also mean making it plain how the political part## ies are now to be fund## ed , a question to which first read## ing provid## ed no un## ambigu## ous answer . 
trans## par## ency would also mean an## other vot## e on the secret## arial allow## ance , which is now again to be surreptitious## ly increas## ed . 
un## fortunate## ly , though , there is not going to be one . 
s## o you can## not be surprise## d at the percept## ion that the Budget is about hagg## ling , and that you , Commission## er , are describ## ed as some## one who had con## cede## d a billion euro## s an hour . 
no proper budget can be drawn up in this fashion ; what is need## ed is ex## plan## ation and change . 
Mr President , I have learn## t some## thing ver## y use## ful in the Committee on Budget## s and some## thing which ha## s ma## de life much easi## er for me , name## ly that it is best to begin by thank## ing the relev## ant individual## s , in order to have ample time to do s## o . 
I should there## fore like to thank Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , the rapporteur , and also Mr## s J## ens## en . 
it is worth re## member## ing that the co## ordinator## s and V## ice @## -## @ Chair## men are respons## ible for the climate of co## operation character## ising work on the budget in the European Parliament . 
this contrast## s with similar work in national parliament## s . 
thank## s are there## fore due to Mr Ferber , Mr## s Gu## y @## -## @ Qu## int , Mr## s Trü## pel , Mr Seppänen , Mr Ro## s## z## kow## ski and to Mr W## alter , Mr Böge and Mr Mulder , the V## ice @## -## @ Chair## men . 
I trust the same climate of co## operation will prevail on Thursday , when we dot the i &apos;## s on the 20## 05 Budget . 
the final version of this budget result## ed from ver## y difficult negoti## ations with the Council . 
we appreci## ate the wish to co## operate and reach a compromis## e dis## play## ed by the Dutch Presidency , and in particular by Mr Nicolaï , and also by Commission## er Grybauskaitė , who acted as mode## rator d## uring the tense hour## s of the meet## ing . 
it is certain## ly tru## e that Parliament defend## ed it## s priorit## ies . 
it resort## ed to the flexibil## ity instrument , e## special## ly in the area## s of internal policy and foreign policy that are ver## y import## ant to us . 
non## e## the## less , th## ose who s## poke in the House today emphasis## ed that the situ## ation will get wor## s## e . 
if we project our## selves in## to the futur## e , in## to the next multi @## -## @ annual Fina## ncial Perspective , thing## s look bleak## er . 
I am s## ure that slimm## ing down the Struct## ural Fund## s , together with a tri## partite decla## ration to anticip## ate an amend## ment to the budget , can## not be describ## ed as sound financial program## ming . 
as regard## s the budget procedure , 20## 05 was a year of new begin## ning## s . 
con## sequent## ly , the qual## ity of administ## ration was particular## ly import## ant . 
I should there## fore like to conclude by thank## ing Mr## s F## ial## ho , Mr De Fe## o and the whole team . 
the## y are genuine civil serv## ants of the kind s## till s## o## re## ly lack## ing in post @## -## @ Communist Europe . 
the## y augur well for the success of futur## e work on the budget . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , invest## ment conditio## ns in the countries of the European Union are favour## able at the present time . 
we have low interest rates , there are no inflation## ary pressure## s , and we have sufficient reserv## es . 
if we compar## e the econom## y of the European Union with the econom## y of the Unit## ed State## s , how## ever , we have to say that invest## ors achiev## e a great## er profit and a quick## er return on the## ir invest## ment in the Unit## ed State## s with the same level of invest## ment . 
the European Union must there## fore orientate it## self to## ward## s structural reform## s at all level## s and in all it## s institution## s . 
it is not appropriate to measure the effective## ness of the financial resource## s invest## ed in particular area## s and indus## tries on## ly on the bas## is of the## ir scale . 
in the absence of feed## back en## ab## ling us to evalu## ate quantitative indic## ators , we must integrate and advance the measure## ment of qual## ity and the measure## ment of add## ed value . 
this also go## es for science and research , as Herr Wurtz ha## s s## aid today . 
the Member State## s must be engage## d in this process . 
e## ach one of them should draft the## ir own Lisbon Strategy , the## ir own financial perspective## s and base the## ir re## venue## s and cost## s on them . 
we all know that the main battle## ground for the Lisbon target## s is the implement## ation of reform## s at a national level . 
I mention all of this be## cause when we talk about the annual budget## s , financial perspective## s and the Lisbon Strategy , we al## ways talk about collect## ive pot## s . 
we have final## ly reach## ed a compromis## e in our discuss## ions on the budget for 20## 05 . 
I believ## e that we can approve the budget collect## ive## ly . 
I would like to thank all the member## s of the Budget## ary Committee for the## ir construct## ive approach . 
we all know that the 20## 05 budget is a transit## ional budget . 
the draft## ing of new financial perspective## s lies a## head of us . 
with the help of these we will have a chance of making a better start on the Lisbon Strategy , which would th## en take on a different qual## ity . 
I should like first of all to thank our rapporteur , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , even though he can## not be here , since it is clear## ly a mammo## th task to examin## e the budget . 
last year , Mr President of the Council , Commission## er , the budget pass## ed through the symbol## ic bar## rier of EUR 1## 00 billion . 
this year , there is a feel## ing that the novel## ty ha## s worn off . 
we have reach## ed the end of two great budget## ary cycle## s and the end , per## hap## s , of two political world## s . 
first of all , clear## ly , we have reach## ed the end of the Pro## di cycle , of the plan## ning for 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 06 and al## read## y , with a tempo## rary Commission , we have be## en and are s## till work## ing on the 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 cycle . 
at the same time , how## ever , we have also reach## ed the end of the cycle of European budget## ary modest## y . the European budget , in fact , even at EUR 1## 06 billion , is less th## an Spa## in &apos;## s ( EUR 1## 17 billion for Spa## in ) . 
every## one realis## es that , with the arriv## al of Tur## key , it is not just EUR 2## 77 million which will have to be add## ed , at pre @## -## @ access## ion s## tage , but EUR 33 billion every year . 
ten year## s from now , con## sequent## ly , the European budget will have double## d and the question of European tax## ation will have to be address## ed . 
we s## hall no long## er be talk## ing about 1 % or 1.2## 4 % of gross national re## venue . 
we s## hall th## en have reach## ed the end of two political world## s . 
first of all , the world of Parliament @## -## @ Council relation## s , since , in 20## 09 , the distinct## ion between com## pul## s## ory and non @## -## @ com## pul## s## ory expend## iture will have dis## appear## ed and the anti @## -## @ farm## ing major## ity in this Parliament will rule again## st the agri## cultural world and the r## ural world . 
this will at the same time be the end of a second world , which is al## read## y happen## ing now , since , in the 20## 05 budget , the agri## cultural appropri## ations have be## en cut by a billion euro and , sub## sequent## ly , these appropri## ations are to be plunder## ed in order to finance other thing## s on the pre## text of r## ural development . 
how## ever , the dis## appearance from village## s of post office## s , rail## way station## s , public re## venue office## s and public service## s clear## ly show## s where we are head## ing . 
this is why I would have like## d us , with the assist## ance of our rapporteur and the assist## ance of our colleague## s , to be able , in the 20## 06 budget , to creat## e a European public holiday in honour of r## ural may## ors in order to pay hom## age to the work of the 90## .000 r## ural may## ors of the village## s of Europe . 
other## wise , our 20## 05 budget al## read## y belong## s to the co## s## y li## ttle world of a Europe with world## wide ambit## ions and a prov## i## ncial budget . 
Mr Mart## in## ez , I di## d not realis## e my## self that we we## re look## ing at all these thing## s together in this budget discuss## ion . 
per## hap## s Mr Dom## br## ovski## s will say some## thing different . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group stand## s for trans## par## ency and maxim## um appropriate use of EU budget resource## s . 
the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group express## es regret that the major## ity of the European Parliament ha## s reject## ed our group &apos;## s propos## al concern## ing the reduction of the European Parliament &apos;## s expend## iture be## low the tradition## al 20 % of total administ## rative expend## iture . 
it ha## s to be acknowledg## ed that this year we channel## led approximate## ly EUR 1## 50 million of un## spent fund## s to## ward## s advance payment## s for next year &apos;## s expend## iture . 
this clear## ly show## s how well @## -## @ found## ed the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group &apos;## s propos## al was . 
in relation to other institution## s , even be## fore the first read## ing the European Parliament had evalu## ated the additional budget re## quest## s of the EU institution## s and it support## ed at first read## ing th## ose re## quest## s , which we## re acknowledg## ed to be just## ified . 
one should recall that the major## ity of re## quest## s for additional budget al## location## s by the EU institution## s are relate## d to the enlarge## ment of the EU , as well as with the new EU financial and staff regulation## s . 
there## fore , at second read## ing we pr## in## cip## ly renew## ed the re## quest## s for additional budget al## location## s by the EU institution## s that the European Parliament had endorse## d , but which the European Council of Minister## s had reject## ed . 
in order to ensu## re great## er EU budget trans## par## ency and appropriate use of budget resource## s , the European Parliament ha## s come up with two new initiative## s . 
first## ly , we invit## e the Commission , when it submit## s it## s annual draft EU budget propos## al , to submit inform## ation at the same time , on official post## s that are vac## ant or have be## en re## organise## d d## uring the year . 
this will allow the European Parliament to better assess the just## ification for re## quest## ing new official post## s . 
second## ly , in order to ensu## re more appropriate use of EU budget resource## s as regard## s the need for extra room## s , chief## ly in connect## ion with the enlarge## ment of the EU , we invit## e all the EU institution## s to work together and to allow the## ir room## s to be us## ed for the require## ments of other institution## s . 
this will make it possible to guarantee the room## s necess## ary for vari## ous meet## ing## s and other even## ts with## out un## necess## ary additional expend## iture on build## ing or rent## ing room## s . 
final## ly , a few word## s on regional policy . 
the European Parliament welcome## s the improve## ments in 20## 04 for the acquis## ition of structural fund## s and does not understand stance in re## duc## ing expend## iture appropri## ations for 20## 05 . 
the European Parliament consider## s it necess## ary to pay the commit## ments set out in the Fina## ncial Perspective in due time , and not to defer payment## s to the last year of the Fina## ncial Perspective . 
Mr President , these people have go## t a nerve and I am amaz## ed the## y have the tem## er## ity to turn up here . 
the## y have not had the## ir account## s sign## ed off for the last ten year## s and the## y want more money to waste , to neglect , to give in fraud and corrupt## ion . 
had the## y be## en running a small comp## any in my country , the## y would not on## ly have be## en prosecu## ted , the## y would prob## ably have be## en jail## ed ! 
why should I vot## e for this ? tell me ! 
why should any of my constitue## nts ? why should any of my country## men ? 
in my country , there are 2.6 million pension## ers liv## ing in p## over## ty on mean## s @## -## @ test## ed benefit## s ; there are 3.6 million child## ren be## low the p## over## ty level ; there are 3## .9 million child## less adult## s liv## ing in p## over## ty ; and we are a rich country ! 
we are the four## th @## -## @ large## st econom## y in the world . 
why are s## o man## y of my constitue## nts liv## ing in p## over## ty ? 
be## cause you lot get the money ! 
be## cause 19 billion pound## s of it go## es to the in## efficient common agri## cultural policy to support in## efficient French , Italia## n and Greek farm## ers . 
why should my constitue## nts suffer for the## ir fraud , the## ir corrupt## ion , and the## ir in## efficiency ? 
the## y should not . 
just taking back our money from the common agri## cultural policy would increas## e pension## s by 30 pound## s a week . 
we## re my constitue## nts ask## ed to give the money to France , I## ta## ly and Greece ? 
no ! 
we## re the## y consult## ed ? 
no ! 
we## re the## y give## n a vot## e ? 
no ! 
and would the## y have vot## ed for it had the## y be## en ? 
no , the## y would not ; and n## either will I . 
you can put your gavel down now , Mr President , be## cause I have finish## ed on time . 
absolut## e## ly , I also regret it be## cause we should have like## d you to continu## e . 
in fact , I do not know what you we## re talk## ing about , whet## her it was re## ally about the European Union , but there is no doubt that the budget was the subject . 
Mr President , it may be that the best thing one can do for demo## cracy is to remain object## ive about thing## s with which one disagree## s , and that is what I s## hall try to do , as the Committee on Trans## port and Tour## ism was not in agree## ment with every aspect of the propos## al## s . 
there we## re two that it high## light## ed : the first had to do with the trans @## -## @ European network## s , where , in a desir## e to s## end a signal about enlarge## ment , the commit## ment appropri## ations we## re increas## ed . 
I see that as a posit## ive sign for , after all , the expend## iture must be comm## ensu## rate with the project## s . 
the second point of disagree## ment concern## ed age## ncies , where the situ## ation is , as we see it , far more difficult , for , whet## her in relation to safety , or to transport by road , air , sea or rail , there are man## y area## s in which a political agree## ment ha## s be## en reach## ed between the Council , Parliament and the Commission . 
when , though , it come## s to al## locating the necess## ary fund## ing , this does not - astonish## ing## ly en## ough - al## ways app## ly . for that reason , where these age## ncies are concern## ed , the question arise## s in our mind## s as to whet## her person## nel cost## s re## ally belong there , be## cause the## y eat in## to the operation## al appropri## ations , or whet## her the person## nel appropri## ations ought to go some## where else . 
I do not propos## e to go more close## ly in## to the technical detail## s right now . 
the other point I would make deal## s with ver## y import## ant area## s . 
of course we are glad that , in the area of measure## s to combat marine poll## ution , which was envi## s## aged and propos## ed by the Council to be a zero ent## ry , a token ent## ry , there are now some fund## s avail## able after all , s## o that we can at least explain to the out## side world that we now have not on## ly the political will , but also the mean## s , to inter## vene in that area . 
it will be for the futur## e to show whet## her the EUR 17 million will be en## ough , after we propos## ed far in excess of EUR 20 million . 
the same appli## es in the case of rail and air transport . 
there is evidence from these age## ncies that the## y can## not do the job proper## ly with the fund## s allocate## d to them , and s## o the warn## ing from the Committee on Trans## port and Tour## ism is that we can## not wait for the next disaster be## fore adjust## ing the resource## s in line with the fact## s of the situ## ation . 
Mr President , I wish to refer to two aspect## s of this debate . 
the first is the reference## s to age## ncies and to bio## terrorism , and I link th## ose two be## cause part of the bio## terrorism work is done through the new Centre for Dis## ease Control which ha## s now be## en establish## ed in Swede## n . 
one of the complain## ts of this paper is that these have not be## en adequate## ly fund## ed , s## o that there is un## certain## ty about how the## y are to operate . 
our citizen## s believ## e that Europe is ver## y often engage## d in spend## ing money on activities that are less th## an necess## ary . 
there are some activities which the## y believ## e are fundamental## ly necess## ary . 
the## ir safety is at the heart of that and it is in our interest## s and our respons## ibility to ensu## re that the## y are proper## ly fund## ed . 
there## fore , I hope that in futur## e the Commission and my colleague## s in this House will ensu## re that age## ncies deal## ing with issue## s s## uch as food safety , medicine## s control and evalu## ation and dis## ease control and prevent## ion are proper## ly deal## t with . 
the second aspect relate## s to the work which lies a## head on vaccin## es and support for develop## ing countries . 
we know how import## ant the## y are - I my## self have produce## d a report on the health threat## s to the countries of the develop## ing world . 
we know that vaccin## ation campaign## s have be## en effective , but much more that can be done . 
in the last four year## s some 35 million child## ren have be## en vaccin## ated - for ex## ample again## st he## pat## itis B - but million## s of child## ren are at risk and dy## ing be## cause adequate fund## s are not avail## able . 
I ver## y much welcome what is be## ing done to put money in## to the vaccin## e fund## s , and I hope we can continu## e in that direct## ion , be## cause that , again , make## s a differ## ence of which we can be proud . 
Mr President , first of all , I should like to extend warm thank## s to the rapporteur , Mr Salv## ador Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , for the excel## lent co## operation . 
even though I am on## ly moderate## ly pleas## ed with the end result , I do think he ha## s done what he can in order to put the position of Parliament , but even more s## o the position of the European country## side , in perspective . 
I feel the same way about the Dutch Presidency , and this bring## s me direct## ly to my major disappoint## ment about this Budget . 
with this agree## ment , we are ultimate## ly near## ly one billion under the correct estimate and the Commission propos## al about what is need## ed . 
I know that the Dutch Presidency ha## s play## ed a posit## ive role in it## self in order to prevent this in part , but I am disappoint## ed great## ly with the rest of the Council , where the last Commission propos## al was eventual## ly not follow## ed . 
which surprise## s me if I consider the position of Europe &apos;## s country## side , if I consider the major agri## cultural reform that ha## s now start## ed and which will result in some## time## s drastic drop## s in in## come , but it also surprise## s me if I consider the enormous programme for r## ural development that we need to introduce as y## et in the ten new Member State## s . 
give## n these circum## stance## s , econom## ising to that ex## tent is un## accept## able , certain## ly if we realis## e that agri## cultural spend## ing will be a## round 0.## 4 % of the G## NP next year . 
that is except## ion## ally li## ttle if we see that European agri## culture and horti## culture meet the world &apos;## s strict## est standard## s in term## s of the environment , anim## al wel## fare , landscape protection , food securit## y and food safety . 
any## one who want## s a cheap ride could get a nas## ty surprise . 
we can## not go on like this . 
I hope that this will not lead to further cut## s in the agri## cultural budget , but that we will continu## e to fight for competitive agri## culture , even in Europe . 
in that respect , I should like to say two thing## s to the UK In## depend## ence Part## y Member## s and No## n @## -## @ attach## ed Member## s in respons## e to the## ir express## ions of blame direct## ed to## ward## s European agri## cultural policy . 
I can tell them that the Unit## ed K## ing## dom receiv## es a dis## proportion## ate## ly large share from the agri## cultural budget . 
my own country represent## s 7 % of production and on## ly receiv## es 2 % of the money . 
in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , the exact re## verse is tru## e . 
with## out this Parliament , the foot and mouth cris## is in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom would not have reach## ed a satisfactory conclusion . 
if these gentle## men can do nothing but make dis## para## ging remark## s , the## y have fail## ed to get the mess## age , including in the Brit## ish country## side , and the## y are leav## ing the Brit## ish country## side firm## ly out in the cold . 
in any e## vent , Parliament , and the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s are keeping an eye on the Brit## ish country## side . 
the citizen## s of Europe are the judge## s of our action## s . 
I believ## e that this budget compromis## e allow## s us to confident## ly look them in the eye , as it provid## es us with the mean## s to reach our go## al## s . 
but will the resource## s describ## ed in budget 20## 05 be sufficient for the long term ? 
we understand that a state budget de## ficit make## s govern## ments try to minimis## e expend## iture . 
how## ever , if expend## iture fall## s be## low a certain level , it become## s point## less : if go## al## s remain dream## s , th## en every euro spent will just be throw## n down the drain . 
the current budget is not like this y## et , but we should put a lot more ef## fort in## to certain area## s in order for our enter## prise## s to be competitive on a world## wide scale and in order to help cohes## ion countries to catch up with other states s## oon## er . 
we must pay attention to the fact that this compromis## e , which I support , expend## s a lot less money th## an what was planned at the 19## 90 budget## ary cycle . 
the question arise## s now at the time of plan## ning a new cycle : what is the point in setting go## al## s for the dis## tant futur## e , or giving number## s for sever## al year## s a## head , if we do not ful## fil them ? 
we , who live## d under Soviet domin## ation , live## d and experience## d what it mean## t to construct f## ive @## -## @ year plan## s from gratuitous number## s . 
I would like to see the Union avoid## ing these pit## fall## s , I have faith it will , and I support next year &apos;## s budget . 
Mr President , I would like to apolog## ise y## et again for not be## ing at the conciliation meet## ing , which was a ver## y length## y and hard @## -## @ f## ought affair . 
I pay trib## ute to the new Commission## er , and particular## ly the minister , who was in charge . 
I heard report## s that the Council of Minister## s was at one in it## s stance on what the level of spend## ing should be . 
as some## one from the Unit## ed K## ing## dom - al## though not of the same political party as the govern## ment - I ver## y much welcome it## s statement , together with that of f## ive other countries , that there should be no level of spend## ing above one per cent of G## NI or G## DP . 
I am de## light## ed that the out## come of this conciliation was exact## ly that . 
as regard## s the age## ncies , more thought need## s to be give## n to the question of the## ir in## come in the futur## e . 
I welcome the move away from in @## -## @ house activity , away from the Commission and in## to arm## s @## -## @ length age## ncies ; but these have mushroom## ed , which is a sign of the## ir success . 
we now need to look at how much more in## come the## y can achiev## e from out## side source## s in## stead of just be## ing give## n grant @## -## @ in @## -## @ aid or subsid## ies from this Parliament . 
I s## peak here as some## one who was chief executive of the Nation## al Build## ing Ag## ency in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom . 
we had to turn a## round ver## y quick## ly from be## ing 85 per cent support## ed by grant## s or subsid## ies to be## ing who## l## ly self @## -## @ support## ing . 
it can be done . 
how## ever , I am not say## ing the change need## s to be that vicious . 
final## ly , with regard to structural fund## ing , the ver## y sens## ible agree## ment that was reach## ed , name## ly , to reduce the spend in 20## 05 but to have an arrange## ment in read## iness agree## d by all part## ies that a supplement## ary and amend## ing budget could be br## ought in at any time , mean## s bo## th that we have control over what is happen## ing in 20## 05 and that reason## s have to be show## n why we need real spend in 20## 06 . 
Mr President , as draft## s## man of the opinion for the report of the Committee on Agri## culture , I regret the arbit## rary cut## s decide## d on by the Council of Minister## s in spend## ing on common agri## cultural policy subsid## ies for 20## 05 . 
this is a cut of no more and no less th## an EUR 1 billion , compar## ed to the European Commission &apos;## s prelimin## ary draft budget , an unprecedented decision , take## n , further## more , with## in the key con## text of the debate on the European Union &apos;## s futur## e financial perspective## s . 
I condemn the flip## p## ancy with which the Council of Minister## s ha## s adopt## ed this decision be## cause it jeopard## ises the fund## ing of agri## cultural subsid## ies for next year , which are the con## sequenc## e of a formal commit## ment by the Member State## s to the European Union &apos;## s farm## ers . 
the Council &apos;## s decision leave## s the manage## ment of common agri## cultural policy subsid## ies in a precarious situ## ation , and this will oblig## e the Commission to app## ly spend## ing disciplin## e which could lead it to commit more th## an one in## justice . 
there ha## s be## en mention of the possibil## ity of later on introdu## c## ing the amend## ing budget to patch up the hole## s in the 20## 05 agri## culture budget , al## though s## o far we do not know where th## ose necess## ary resource## s are going to come from . 
it is clear that the countries in favour of re## duc## ing the contribut## ions to the Comm## un## ity budget have won the first battle , be## cause the Council of Minister## s ha## s un## anim## ously support## ed this cut . 
this un## anim## ity also include## d my country . 
no## body ha## s dar## ed to question this decision , which , further## more , take## s no account of the opinion of this House . 
at first read## ing the European Parliament re @## -## @ establish## ed the European Commission &apos;## s prelimin## ary draft budget , an initiative which ha## s be## en complete## ly ignor## ed by the Council of Minister## s , the on## ly body with decision @## -## @ making power## s with regard to oblig## atory spend## ing . 
the cut in agri## cultural spend## ing for 20## 05 is simpl## y a fore## runner of what could happen from 20## 07 , when the European Commission will have to present a report to assess whet## her or not it is necess## ary to introduce cut## s in the unit s## um## s of the direct aid receiv## ed by European farm## ers . 
un## fortunate## ly , the European Parliament &apos;## s voice ha## s not be## en take## n in## to account on this occasion . 
I would , there## fore , like to call on this House to try to prevent this situ## ation from recur## ring next year . 
Mr President , just like Mr Sala## franc## a Sánchez @## -## @ Neyra , I am some## what con## fuse## d about the s## peak## ing arrange## ments . 
I am s## peak## ing in this House as draft## s## man of the opinion of the Committee on Develop## ment on the Budget and should in fair## ness have be## en allow## ed to s## peak at the begin## ning . 
I wish to congratul## ate Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o on hi## s ver## y skilful work , for hi## s consider## able sensitiv## ity to view## s from the vari## ous committee## s and , in general , for hi## s efficient hand## ling of our delibe## rations . 
as current represent## ative of the Committee on Develop## ment , I am de## light## ed with the result . 
by making full use of the flexibil## ity mechan## ism , we have be## en able to avoid significant## ly cut## ting back on long @## -## @ term development programme## s in order to make room for Iraq . 
I genuine## ly agree with Mr Sala## franc## a Sánchez @## -## @ Neyra that we must find a long @## -## @ term solution to the problem that , in general , arise## s every year in connect## ion with major disaster## s and cris## es . 
we must protect our long @## -## @ term development programme## s if we are to have a chance of making a construct## ive contribut## ion to the work on achiev## ing the mill## ennium object## ive## s . 
when it come## s to the specific focus in head## ing 4 , I am ver## y pleas## ed to have gain## ed a hear## ing for the demand that the budget be more clear## ly orient## ed to## ward## s p## over## ty allevi## ation . 
this is happen## ing through the increas## e of EUR 30 million in the appropri## ation to ef## fort## s with## in Asia , where the vast major## ity of the world &apos;## s poor live . 
it is also happen## ing through the increas## e in ef## fort## s in the area of health . 
more resource## s are be## ing earmark## ed for the work on re## duc## ing the spread of H## IV , mal## aria and T## B . 
as Mr Bow## is emphasis## ed just now , a new programme to the tune of EUR 10 million is also be## ing set up to combat other p## over## ty @## -## @ relate## d dis## ease## s , with a special emphasis on vaccin## ations for young child## ren . 
far great## er resource## s are need## ed in the area of health , e## special## ly in Africa . 
the contribut## ions we are now de## cid## ing upon mean that we are continu## ing s## ing## le @## -## @ mind## ed## ly to work with a view to increas## ing support for the health sector with## in the sphere of aid , and that is an entire## ly proper road to go down . 
. Mr President , let me start by thank## ing Member## s of Parliament for the## ir interest## ing remark## s . 
my first remark is in respons## e to what Mr## s Trü## pel and Mr Wurtz s## aid . 
it is absolut## e## ly clear that I am s## peak## ing here not on be## half of the net contribut## ors , the &apos; one per cent group &apos; , or the govern## ment of the N## ether## land## s , but on be## half of the Council . 
the Council was un## anim## ously in favour of budget## ary disciplin## e . 
it was also un## anim## ously in favour of on## ly a s## light increas## e in payment appropri## ations , taking in## to account the need## s of an enlarge## d Union . 
this bring## s me to concern## s express## ed by Mr Ferber , Mr Wurtz and Mr Maat about the level of payment appropri## ations not be## ing en## ough for all the need## s in 20## 05 . 
the Council &apos;## s second read## ing is bas## ed on the principle of budget## ary disciplin## e . 
the Council was unit## ed in believ## ing that the level of payment appropri## ations was of prim## e import## ance . this is why the Council show## ed an ex## ample by re## duc## ing com## pul## s## ory expend## iture in the field of agri## culture . 
in our global agree## ment , the payment appropri## ations are EUR 1 billion high## er th## an the Council &apos;## s estimate of what is necess## ary to ful## fil the oblig## ations in 20## 05 . 
accord## ing to the Commission , which ha## s to implement the budget , the agree## d maxim## um amount is sufficient . 
equal## ly import## ant is the fact that the Council will take up it## s respons## ibility if it turn## s out that payment appropri## ations are in## sufficient . 
the Council ha## s prov## ed that this is not a hollow phrase : it provid## ed additional payment## s for structural measure## s this year , as you know . 
we have commit## ted our## selves to do## ing this in just one read## ing for any additional fund## ing need## ed , as Commission## er Grybauskaitė mention## ed . 
it was interest## ing to hear Mr Ferber &apos;## s question on the result## s in conciliation with regard to the additional fund## s for 20## 05 . 
he forgo## t to mention the EUR 10 billion that we go## t back un## spent in 20## 03 . 
in conclusion , I agree with Commission## er Grybauskaitė that the## y we## re tough negoti## ations . 
I would like to thank her , the rapporteur## s and the Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s for the## ir construct## ive role in the negoti## ations . 
the result is what count## s , and it is a good compromis## e . 
I ver## y much agree with Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o , who s## aid it is not a win @## -## @ lose situ## ation , it is a win @## -## @ win situ## ation : there is room for bo## th budget## ary disciplin## e and political priorit## ies . 
at the end of the day it is a win @## -## @ win situ## ation for European citizen## s . 
- I do not think that the Commission wish## es to inter## vene again . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place on Thursday at 11.## 30 a.m . 
-## the next item is the or## al question to the Commission by Mr Bor## rell Font## elles , on be## half of the Tempo## rary Committee on Poli## cy Cha## lleng## es and Budget## ary M## eans of the Enlarg## ed Union , on the prepar## ation of the next financial frame## work . 
Mr President , Commission## er , the Pro## di Commission left us with two communic## ations : one on the general frame## work for the 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 15 budget and an## other on the legal base## s for the poli## cies which must be fund## ed . 
the Council of Minister## s ha## s al## read## y beg## un work## ing on an committee , as it## s represent## ative , Mr Nicolaï , ha## s told us , and we in the European Parliament have creat## ed a tempo## rary committee , which it is my honour to chair , which ha## s al## read## y produce## d a s## eries of document## s and with## in which our rapporteur , Mr Böge , is do## ing ver## y consider## able work on making Parliament &apos;## s position coherent . 
we are all , there## fore , aware of the import## ance of this task , which must serve to establish the political priorit## ies and define the budget## ary resource## s avail## able to the Union d## uring 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
every## body know## s - though I must remind you of it - that with## out the agree## ment of Parliament there will be no financial perspective## s . 
with## out the agree## ment of Parliament it will not be possible to reach an inter## institutional agree## ment which does not appear in the Treat## y . 
Parliament wish## es to reach an agree## ment with## in the time limit laid down in the time## table , but it want## s a good agree## ment , and in order to achiev## e one , certain issue## s must be clar## ified straight## away . 
first## ly , we need to know whet## her the current Commission official## ly accept## s the propos## al## s of the out## going Commission . 
it is tru## e that you , Commission## er , have al## read## y told us in the meet## ing of the Tempo## rary Committee on Poli## cy Cha## lleng## es and Budget## ary M## eans , that the Commission head## ed by Mr Barros## o direct## ly accept## s the propos## al## s of the out## going Commission . 
short## ly after## ward## s , how## ever , leak## s and comment## s have appear## ed in the media suggest## ing that the Commission intend## s , or at least accept## s , not going as far as the propos## al## s produce## d by the Pro## di Commission . 
this is the time for you , Commission## er , here in Parliament , in the absence of the President of the Commission , formal## ly to tell us , in your opinion , the level of resource## s Europe need## s in order to ful## fil it## s ambit## ions . 
it would also be good if you could explain to us which in## come structure## s you believ## e are most appropriate in order for the Union to be able to confront it## s current and futur## e need## s . 
second## ly , it would also be a good thing for us to explore what would happen in the e## vent that certain Member State## s prevent an agree## ment from be## ing reach## ed with## in the relev## ant time limit . 
would the Commission th## en be prepar## ed to provid## e for the transit## ional provision## s necess## ary to ensu## re the continu## ity of multi @## -## @ annual programme## s in the absence of a frame## work agree## ment on the financial perspective## s ? 
as you know , Parliament ha## s al## read## y express## ed it## s pre## ference with regard to the dur## ation of these financial perspective## s . 
we believ## e that f## ive year## s is prefer## able since it is more in line with the dur## ation of the term## s in office of Parliament and of the Commission . 
Commission## er , Mr President , by creat## ing a Tempo## rary Committee on Poli## cy Cha## lleng## es and Budget## ary M## eans and appoint## ing it## s own President as chair## man of that committee , which is not normal , this Parliament wish## ed to give a clear demonst## ration of it## s interest and political commit## ment to a process which is s## o sensitiv## e and essential to the futur## e of Europe . 
we know that we are fac## ing some ver## y import## ant challenge## s . 
how to fund the enlarge## ment we have just car## ried out . 
how to confront the enlarge## ments which are on the horizon and which will un## doubt## ed## ly take place with## in the frame## work of the futur## e financial perspective## s . 
how to ensu## re that Europe &apos;## s increas## ing role in the world is back## ed up with sufficient economic resource## s . 
how to realis## e the poli## cies which will make Europe what we al## ways call , when s## peak## ing of Lisbon , the most dynamic and competitive econom## y in the world . 
all of this must be include## d in the budget , be## cause what is not in the budget does not exist , as Fin## ance Minister## s say . 
the express## ion may be some## what of an exagger## ation , but we know that , in order for certain thing## s to exist , the## y must first appear in the budget## s . 
Commission## er , Mr President , the Barros## o Commission ha## s be## en confirm## ed by mean## s of a ver## y broad vot## e of con## fidence from this House . 
this is the time for you to demonst## rate that you are not simpl## y medi## ators between Parliament and the Council , but that you are able to show strong political leader## ship . 
the financial perspective## s offer a great opportun## ity to demonst## rate this . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , we set to work on the bas## is of the Communic## ation and the propos## al## s from the Commission . 
in order to be able to press on with our work , we do of course need answer## s to the question## s that this House &apos;## s President ha## s just address## ed . 
in fact , Commission## er , there are plen## ty of discuss## ions and rumour## s a## foot , and per## hap## s today &apos;## s debate will help clar## ify matter## s . 
for ex## ample , you told a meet## ing of the Tempo## rary Committee that the agri## culture policy was a re## lic of the nineteen## th cent## ury . 
if that is the case , why is there no propos## al from the Commission to change it ? 
or does it not after all contribut## e some## thing to the Lisbon strate## gy and to sustain## ability , in view of the current state of play where decision## s on agri## cultural reform are concern## ed ? 
Commission## er Ver## heugen ha## s s## aid that , in order to make a success of Lisbon , we need more respons## ibility and great## er commit## ment from the Member State## s , but we see it as also involv## ing the question of add## ed value for Europe , of whet## her Lisbon is mean## t to implement the Budget more vigorous## ly , particular## ly in connect## ion with the programme## s that bring Europe add## ed value , in research and the multi## annual educ## ation programme## s . 
th## en , we hear report## s of internal discuss## ions even at this ear## ly s## tage about the possibil## ity of mov## ing away from the 1.1## 4 % , and th## en some## one put## s forward the idea that 1.0## 6 % , or 1.0## 7 % , would be a work## able compromis## e , s## o let me , as rapporteur , make it perfect## ly clear that no## body in the other institution## s should imagin## e that Parliament is prepar## ed to negotiate be## low the margin## s set as a network by Article 27## 2 of the Treat## y . 
let me add that this is with## out taking account of the European Develop## ment Fund , which add## s an## other 0.## 03 % and ha## s , for the first time , be## en include## d in the figure of 1.1## 4 % in the Commission propos## al and hence also in the Budget . 
Commission## er , you describ## ed a cris## is situ## ation feat## uring all the thing## s that can happen if agree## ment fail## s to be achiev## ed . 
we want agree## ment , and that is why , y## et again today , we insist on a month## ly tri## logue cap## able of ens## uring that difficult chap## ter## s are not left to be deal## t with at the end of the procedure , but ra## ther that issue## s of flexibil## ity , dur## ation of the Fina## ncial Perspective and man## y point## s of sub## stance can be discuss## ed in good time and consider## ed joint## ly as part of a per## man## ent dia## logue between the institution## s . 
. Mr President , I am suppose## d to say that official## ly I am respond## ing on be## half of the Commission to four question## s from Parliament , but I receiv## ed a lot more . 
I will try to answer them as well as giving the &apos; official &apos; respons## e . 
I must say at the out## set that in the Commission there are no internal discuss## ions on ceil## ing## s other th## an the official propos## al that was present## ed to you and to the Council . 
de## spite media rumour## s , this is not a subject for discuss## ion in the Commission . 
now the &apos; official &apos; respons## e to the first question : does the new Commission endorse the structure of the new financial perspective ? 
y## es , the enlarge## d European Union face## s new challenge## s and need## s to meet new expect## ations . 
we need to update the structure of our financial perspective## s to better reflect these new priorit## ies . 
this entail## s a new class## ification of expend## iture to give a new profile for the Union &apos;## s finance## s . 
this more limit## ed number of expend## iture head## ing## s reflect## s the Union &apos;## s main priorit## ies , making them more visible to European citizen## s and rational## ising expend## iture accord## ing## ly . 
this Commission endorse## s the same priorit## ies , i.e## . transform## ing the European Union in## to a dynamic knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed econom## y , pursu## ing great## er cohes## ion in the con## text of the enlarge## ment of the European Union , pre## serv## ing and man## aging the European Union &apos;## s natural resource## s - including agri## culture , fisher## ies and the environment - and develop## ing the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice and the role of the Union as a global partner . 
the propos## al## s be## fore us reflect the need## s of the Union , first## ly be## cause these priorit## ies ident## ify and represent a common con## sensus about where Europe must intens## ify it## s action## s . 
second## ly , the propos## ed structure also offer## s a real step to## ward## s simpl## ification and rational## isation , which was welcome## d by Parliament in it## s re## solution of 22 April . 
final## ly , the propos## al## s have al## read## y allow## ed bo## th the Council and Parliament to have substanti## al discuss## ions and prepar## e the ground for an agree## ment next year . 
the second question : does the new Commission endorse the dur## ation of the financial programme## s which will commit the next Commission and the next European Parliament ? 
let me assure you that the Commission is fully aware of Parliament &apos;## s position - which was also express## ed in the re## solution of 22 April - in which it call## s for a financial frame## work to be establish## ed for a period of on## ly f## ive year## s . 
how## ever , we look## ed in## to this question and conclude## d that for the next program## ming period , seven year## s would be the best solution be## cause the ceil## ing for market @## -## @ relate## d expend## iture and direct payment## s - in agri## culture , for ex## ample - ha## s al## read## y be## en fix## ed by the European Council until 20## 13 . 
a seven @## -## @ year time## table also maxim## ises the benefit## s of long @## -## @ term plan## ning , in particular in cohes## ion poli## cies . 
the thir## d question : does the new Commission endorse all the propos## al## s in what is known as the &apos; Pro## di package &apos; , or does it consider that it should be re## adjust## ed and , if s## o , on which issue## s ? 
as I s## aid ear## lier , we endorse all the propos## al## s . 
the Commission stand## s by the package propos## ed ear## lier this year . 
we do not call it by that name : it is the Commission &apos;## s propos## al and we endorse that propos## al , name## ly the propos## ed financial frame## work , complement## ed by a s## eries of legisl## ative and non @## -## @ legisl## ative propos## al## s adopt## ed between Fe## bru## ary and Sept## ember 20## 04 . 
the## y have be## en submit## ted to the Council and to vari## ous committee## s of this Parliament . 
the Commission foresee## s the adopt## ion of the remain## ing necess## ary propos## al## s ear## ly next year . 
the political project which under## pin## s the financial perspective## s is bas## ed on a number of well @## -## @ establish## ed priorit## ies on which a con## sensus al## read## y exist## s between the European institution## s on the number of commit## ments al## read## y ma## de , for ex## ample on agri## culture , enlarge## ment , Lisbon , etc . 
build## ing on this , the Commission is now also prepar## ing it## s f## ive @## -## @ year strategic object## ive## s , which will be present## ed to Parliament by the end of Janu## ary 20## 05 . 
the Commission believ## es that the propos## al## s constitut## e a good bas## is for an agree## ment for the next financial perspective . 
to reach s## uch an agree## ment the Commission will be taking an active part in the discuss## ions and negoti## ations that will take place with the European Parliament and the Council . 
in this con## text , the Commission will take fully in## to account the key point## s of the discuss## ion and will striv## e to reach a political agree## ment by the end of Ju## ne 20## 05 . 
the four## th question : is the Commission read## y to take account of other institution## s &apos; priorit## ies ? 
the answer is y## es . 
the Commission will of course take care## ful account of Parliament &apos;## s position in relation to the initiative## s al## read## y propos## ed and in view of th## ose that will arriv## e in 20## 05 . 
the package is al## read## y bas## ed on a ver## y broad con## sensus about where action## s are require## d , in the light of European Parliament re## solution## s , European Council conclusion## s and , in## de## ed , discuss## ions with## in the Commission . 
the forth## coming discuss## ions on the Commission &apos;## s strategic object## ive## s are direct## ly link## ed to this , and the Commission attach## es consider## able import## ance to the establish## ment of common priorit## ies . 
the Constitution will mean a cod## ified multi## annual financial frame## work , and I would like a common vision for the next program## ming period to be our first step on this path . 
I would like to make two brief point## s in final## ising the official answer to the question table## d . 
first , I wish to remind you of what President Barros## o ha## s s## aid in this House : the European Union need## s to match it## s political ambit## ion with it## s financial resource## s . 
increas## ed spend## ing ha## s be## en propos## ed be## cause , with enlarge## ment and with a demand for action in new area## s , it was inevit## able . 
we can## not have a large## r European Union with less money . 
second## ly , I under## line the Commission &apos;## s strong commit## ment to the need to respect the target of a political agree## ment by Ju## ne 20## 05 and the adopt## ion of legisl## ative propos## al## s by the end of that year . 
the Irish and N## ether## land## s preside## ncies have achiev## ed consider## able progress d## uring the## ir respect## ive term## s in the Council . 
we all need to sustain the moment## um and active## ly support the ef## fort## s of the Luxembourg preside## ncy to achiev## e political agree## ment by the end of it## s term . 
the Commission wish## es the preside## ncy well in the task of achiev## ing the go## al## s which will be use## ful for all European citizen## s . 
. thank you , Mr President , thank you , Commission## er , for the first respons## e you have just give## n us . 
in s## o do## ing , you have confirm## ed what you s## aid to our Tempo## rary Committee and the Committee on Budget## s . 
in short , I have to say that your respons## e does not al## together satisf## y us since it amount## s to say## ing that the new Commission is adopt## ing the pre## vi## ous Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s with## out examin## ing them in detail , and that it believ## es that the ball is now in Parliament &apos;## s and the European Council &apos;## s court## s . 
we are in fact look## ing to the Commission to show not the passive att## itude of a medi## ator but the leader## ship of a political executive strong in the con## fidence mass## ive## ly express## ed by Parliament scarce## ly a month ago , to quote President Bor## rell . 
it is all the more necess## ary and ur## gent that the new Commission should adopt a strong position now that initial sound## ing## s of all concern## ed in the Council have reveal## ed that , for the first time , some Member State## s are propos## ing to cut the relativ## e amount of the present budget , as Mr Böge s## aid . 
thu## s , the Commission## er for indus## try is say## ing public## ly that there are current## ly 27 priorit## ies for the Lisbon strate## gy and that the## y should be combin## ed in## to one . 
will that not be reflect## ed in the budget ? 
you say there ha## s be## en no debate in the Commission over the propos## ed amount for the ceil## ing of own resource## s . 
when will that debate take place ? 
in what area## s would financial sacrifice## s be in## es## cap## able for the Commission if this resource## s ceil## ing we## re not obtain## ed ? 
can the propos## al## s ma## de by Mr Pro## di reason## ably be financ## ed on the bas## is of the present system of European Union financ## ing , or does the Commission believ## e that negoti## ations should cover in## come as well as expend## iture ? 
final## ly , what provision## al measure## s should be take## n , and when , if , as seem## s high## ly like## ly , the Council fail## s to reach a con## sensus be## fore the process of rat## ifying the Constitution is complete## d ? 
as you have remind## ed us , President Barros## o say## s we can## not have more Europe for less money . 
how much money does the policy propos## ed by President Barros## o require ? 
. Mr President , Commission## er , I am s## peak## ing today in my capacity as my group &apos;## s co## ordinator in the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment , which ha## s the second large## st individual budget to deal with , as the budget for cohes## ion and structural policy , with a 35 % share , is second on## ly in s## ize to the budget for agri## culture . 
a## long## side the task## s we have to perform in deal## ing with the Fina## ncial Perspective , the special## ist committee## s and most e## special## ly the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment have the task of prepar## ing the relev## ant Regul## ations for e## ach Fund for the new financial period of 20## 07 to 20## 13 . 
I see the anchor## ing of this cohes## ion and structural policy , including in our Constitution , on the bas## is of the Lisbon and C## open## hagen conclusion## s , as creat## ing ver## y modern political approach## es to the implement## ation of a European policy for the public &apos;## s benefit . 
what we in the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment need for our work is a reli## able statement and found## ation , and bo## th I and my group believ## e that on## ly the Pro## di propos## al can ful## fil that role . 
I will permit my## self the a## side that I get the impress## ion that regional policy appear## s to be us## ed by every## one as a sort of piggy bank . 
the Council does it by attempt## ing to get a per## cent## age accept## ed while a major## ity of it## s member## s want to make cut## s be## cause agri## culture ha## s al## read## y ground to a halt . 
having seen the way you , Commission## er , deal with the Committee on Budget## s and the tempo## rary committee on the political challenge## s and Budget resource## s for the enlarge## d EU between 20## 07 and 20## 13 , I can say that the Commission does too , call## ing ever more frequent## ly for a Fina## ncial Perspective . 
I get the impress## ion that the second half of that sentenc## e is mis## s## ing : &apos; whet## her that Perspective be good or bad . &quot; 
that is some## thing we can## not afford . 
the attempt is ma## de ever more frequent## ly to use structural policy measure## s to fund other thing## s ; the ex## ample I would give is the way in which the fund## ing of Natura 20## 00 is be## ing re## mov## ed from the environment## al sector and mov## ed to structural policy . 
let me also say , though , that regional policy was necess## ary in the old EU of 15 Member State## s , and it is necess## ary in the new one , with it## s 25 . 
we need efficiency , but we can## not afford it to happen that drastic cut## s in this area punish a large part of the population for some## thing that we all want## ed and that the European Union al## ways ha## s ma## de tang## ible and access## ible to million## s of citizen## s . 
Commission## er , you s## aid that the news## paper## s report on## ly fail## ures . 
in Germa## ny , we have a say## ing to the effect that there is no smoke with## out fire . 
that is why debate## s about 1.0## 5 % or 1.0## 6 % are not helpful . 
let me remind you that the European Union ha## s al## ways work## ed well when the Commission ha## s strength## ened Parliament and vice versa . 
we can negotiate well together , whet## her the Council is on the same side or our opponent . 
Mr President , we in the Group of the Alli## ance of Liberal## s and Democrat## s for Europe we## re ver## y pleas## ed to see that the Pro## di Commission attach## ed s## uch great import## ance to the Lisbon object## ive## s when it present## ed it## s draft financial estimate## s . 
we also note that improve## d competitive## ness and increas## ed grow## th in Europe are a## mong the thing## s that are genuine## ly high on the Barros## o Commission &apos;## s age## nda and have be## en s## o right from the start . 
that is some## thing we have also seen follow## ing the clear observ## ations ma## de by Mr Barros## o today here in plen## ary . 
I there## fore think it on## ly natural to ask the Commission whet## her it will face the implic## ations of it## s s## harp focus on the Lisbon object## ive## s and amend the Pro## di Commission &apos;## s propos## al . 
is there any## where it will allocate more resource## s to improve competitive## ness and to creat## e increas## ed grow## th and more job## s ? 
are there any change## s to the structure of the financial frame## work ? 
is there to be more focus upon grow## th @## -## @ orient## ed policy area## s ? 
are there thing## s to be dispens## ed with ? 
what we have here is a large complex of legisl## ation and propos## al## s . 
I appreci## ate that what exist## s at present form## s the point of depart## ure , but it might how## ever be interest## ing to hear whet## her there is any## thing to which more weight is to be give## n and whet## her there are any negat## ive priorit## ies . 
if there are to be priorit## ies , where are the cut## back## s to be ma## de first ? 
when we in Parliament debate the financial estimate## s , we do not focus upon an expend## iture ceil## ing , as some countries in the Council do . 
we do not wish to become ti## ed up in the Council &apos;## s blink## er## ed discuss## ions of 1 % or what## ever . 
I am pleas## ed that , in this House today , you have s## aid that per## cent## age## s are not be## ing discuss## ed in the Commission either - at any rate , not at the moment . 
we must not talk about quant## ity , but qual## ity . 
Parliament must there## fore call upon the Commission to pre## serve a s## to## ical calm and first of all discuss the content of EU policy . 
we can discuss budget ceil## ing## s sub## sequent## ly . 
we now have a un## ique opportun## ity to consider what we want , as well as what we want the futur## e EU to look like between 20## 07 and 20## 13 , and that is an opportun## ity we must not waste . 
as far as my own group is concern## ed , it is import## ant to have the focus on research , to strength## en the common research programme## s and per## hap## s even to consider creat## ing a fund for basic research that can strength## en research in futur## e technologies s## uch as nano## technology , allow## ing the EU also to be a key play## er . 
we must consider obtain## ing increas## ed benchmark## ing of our univers## ities in Europe in term## s of a fair compar## ison of who does what best on a cross @## -## @ border bas## is , and we must creat## e health## y competit## ion . 
we must look at our train## ing programme## s and see whet## her the## y take account of need## s in the new Member State## s where , for ex## ample , man## y stu## dent## s can## not afford to travel and learn new thing## s . 
again , it may be ask## ed : &apos; have we obtain## ed the correct focus in what we now have ? &quot; 
this , clear## ly , is the debate in which we in Parliament s## hall engage and on which we s## hall work . 
that be## ing s## aid , the big battle will clear## ly centre upon regional policy . 
it is regional policy that is the difficult area . 
when you attend## ed the hear## ing## s here in Parliament , you we## re courage## ous en## ough to express the view that some of the new countries we## re prob## ably able to absorb more th## an 4 % of gross domestic product . 
I s## hall be interest## ed to hear whet## her you s## till hold that view , Mr## s Grybauskaite , o## nce you are Commission## er . 
in this area too , we s## hall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to creat## e qual## ity ra## ther th## an just look to quant## ity . 
what we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is there## fore cruc## ial , and we appreci## ate , of course , that this is quit## e a difficult subject , including for the Council . 
I hope that we can obtain a construct## ive dia## logue and a month## ly trialogue , for it is import## ant for us to go on discuss## ing these matter## s . 
it is quit## e a package that we have here . 
. Mr President , the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance regard## s the Commission propos## al## s as a sound bas## is for negoti## ations between Parliament and the Council . 
I understand that you now want to refer to it as the Barros## o package in## stead of the Pro## di package . 
that is fine with me . after all , I am concern## ed with content . 
I ver## y much welcome 1.1## 4 % of the G## DP for invest## ments in the Lisbon strate## gy , for money for an economic incentiv## e in the poor## er region## s and for rein## forc## ing the EU &apos;## s role in the world . 
my group is also critical of your plan## s , though . 
after all , the futur## e generation## s , our child## ren , appear to be get## ting a rough deal . 
invest## ments in renew## able , sustain## able energ## y source## s are in## adequate , which is detriment## al to the environment and is also feed## ing depend## ency on all kind## s of dub## ious regime## s in countries where oil flow## s in abundance . 
there is no separat## e fund for Natura 20## 00 , there are in## sufficient resource## s for im## prov## ing the re## ception of refuge## es in the region and the increas## e in fund## s for culture and exchange programme## s for young people is too small . 
we would like to promot## e Europe a li## ttle less and ensu## re that people experience Europe a li## ttle more . 
s## o , it is 1.1## 4 % &apos; p## lus , &quot; as far as my group is concern## ed . 
that is , in## de## ed , quit## e different from what man## y Member State## s say . 
some of th## ose Member State## s s## till app## ly the 1 % mantra . 
mean## while , the## y have sneak## ily become more radical , be## cause I notice## d that the## y are mean## while app## ly## ing 1 % in the commit## ment appropri## ations in## stead of in the payment## s , which have tradition## ally al## ways be## en some## what lower . 
that would mean that up to 20## 13 , we would have a budget that is lower th## an we have at present , while the European Union ha## s enlarge## d . 
all the while , we are busy making list## s of ambit## ions . 
the Member State## s do not all follow the same view . 
the cut## s in agri## culture and the structural fund## s are , in fact , ver## y controversial . 
a child will there## fore realis## e that th## ose will main## ly remain in## tact in the major negoti## ations . 
where will the cut## s be ma## de ? 
in the fund## s for research , development , human right## s , the environment , external policy and culture . 
precise## ly th## ose area## s that are close to people &apos;## s heart## s and that are give## n a visible add## ed value if the## y are implement## ed at European level . 
a budget that is borne out of euro## sceptic## ism will on## ly feed that euro## sceptic## ism even more . 
in that way , we will retain a Europe that is main## ly focus## ed on the market and the curr## ency , and that is head## ing absolut## e## ly the wrong way . 
I agree with Mr Lama## s## s## our## e , who states that we need more active leader## ship from the Commission . 
if we re## ally want - and that is what we uphold , after all - that Europe is a Europe that is unit## ed in divers## ity , we will need to active## ly invest in this . 
I would also like to call on the Commission to use us , be## cause the## y do not know our position y## et . 
we may be argu## ing in favour of 1.5 % , be## cause we are far more ambitious th## an the Member State## s . 
with 1.1## 4 % , the Commission will there## fore be tread## ing a middle path . 
I there## fore hope that you will gain the strategic in## sight to dis## pel all the smoke that is continu## ously be## ing creat## ed and which we think may be indic## ative of a small fire - you may have drop## ped 1.0## 7 % some## where in secret after all . 
we urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe . 
show your leader## ship . 
prove it in the negoti## ations , for that is the on## ly way of creat## ing a Europe that is not the old Europe of the market and of the curr## ency , but a Europe that take## s people and the environment to heart . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the debate on the Union &apos;## s Fina## ncial Perspective ought to be a debate on the futur## e of Europe . 
the deca## de 20## 04 @## -## @ 20## 13 will be character## ised by the access## ion of 12 new countries . 
the Union need## s to decide whet## her it is going to promot## e the un## ification of Europe and equal## ity of opportun## ity , or whet## her it is to creat## e division## s and height## en in## equal## ities . 
research establish## ments## civic soci## ety , entrepreneur## s and other## s ought to contribut## e to the debate on the futur## e of Europe , not just politic## ians . 
un## fortunate## ly , the Union is not in favour of a public debate of this kind . 
in## stead , the futur## e of Europe is be## ing decide## d in remote office## s . 
bureaucrat## s and politic## ians are taking the decision## s on task## s and resource## s , and the## y also decide how to allocate fund## s and on the amount## s involve## d . 
in the mean## time , Parliament is busy deba## ting minor issue## s together with the possibil## ity of broad## ening it## s compete## nce## s . 
even if Parliament &apos;## s compete## nce## s we## re to be increas## ed , there will be no time to prepar## e our own draft budget tack## ling two major issue## s , name## ly how to speed up the pace of economic development and how to reduce the differ## ence## s between rich## er and poor## er region## s of Europe . 
a new budget is require## d , how## ever , as the Commission &apos;## s draft run## s counter to the not## ion of solid## arity and is not con## duc## ive to speed## ing up the development of Europe . 
this is tru## e bo## th of the propos## al## s and the s## um## s refer## red to there## in . 
the best ex## ample I could mention is the fact that the countries of the old Fif## teen , which are all rich , are to receiv## e in excess of EUR 19## 4 billion from the Cohesion Fund , whi## lst the ten new Member State## s and Roman## ia and Bulgaria are on## ly due to receiv## e EUR 1## 80 billion . 
it is also worth re## member## ing that a significant proportion of the second s## um will end up in the rich## er countries , in the form of order and of payment## s to advis## ers and expert## s . 
in our view , the European Parliament ought to come up with it## s own draft budget . 
this should either be under## take## n in op## position to the Commission and the Council , or in co## operation with them . 
this budget would be bas## ed on three principle## s . 
the first of these is that the great## er the Union , the great## er the budget . 
the second is that the great## er the differ## ence## s in development , the more fund## ing should go to less @## -## @ develop## ed region## s and Member State## s . 
the thir## d principle is that tax and invest## ment concession## s are require## d , as are other appropriate measure## s for the benefit of less @## -## @ develop## ed region## s and countries . 
Mr President , if you per## hap## s try to explain what this is all about to a young female citizen of the European Union and to a middle @## -## @ aged mal## e one , do you not inevit## ably end up making compar## ison## s with the Soviet Union and tell## ing them that we are deal## ing with a seven @## -## @ year plan ra## ther th## an a f## ive @## -## @ year one ? 
is it not the case that the decision @## -## @ making machine## ry is ver## y much compar## able to that which th## en operate## d in Mos## cow , with the differ## ence that lobby## ists are now involve## d ? 
and if you turn it a## round and tell them that you understand the European public &apos;## s need for money , and th## en consider the priorit## ies and say : right , I re## ally do want to double the educ## ation budget ; I do want to double the research budget - how , th## en , my dear Commission## er , do you make that trans## parent ? 
how do you set it out ? 
if you do not manage to make it clear what we need all this money for , public support will certain## ly be deni## ed to you , and Europe will slide even close## r to the brink of disaster . 
the President of the European Commission ma## de certain comment## s last week - and a colleague ha## s point## ed this out today - to the effect that more Europe can## not be creat## ed with less money . 
today , Commission## er , you have confirm## ed that the current Commission is maintain## ing the propos## al of the pre## vi## ous Commission . 
I would add - to th## ose people who are const## ant## ly claim## ing to be European## ists - that less money mean## s the re## national## isation of the cohes## ion policy , which is equi## valent to less Europe . 
n## ever## the## less , the Commission will prob## ably s## oon propos## e amend## ments depend## ing on how the negoti## ations develop . 
and I am s## ure that the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s will be bas## ed on the principle of balance . 
I would , there## fore , like to ask the European Commission to review the aspect## s of it## s propos## al which could lead to un## fair result## s be## cause of the## ir lack of balance , Commission## er . 
be## cause I believ## e that to a certain ex## tent that is what is happen## ing at this point in the negoti## ations . 
in order to provid## e material for this debate - either end## ors## ing it or reject## ing it - I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the inform## ation avail## able to it on the impact on the fifteen Member State## s of the cost## s of enlarge## ment - which , of course , is absolut## e## ly essential - be## cause the intention to pay for the converge## nce require## ments of our new partner## s at the expense of solid## arity with the countries and region## s of the exist## ing State## s would be pro## found## ly anti @## -## @ European and harm## ful to our share## d futur## e . 
I s## hall end by express## ing my support for the European Commission , provid## ed that it maintain## s the Cohesion Poli## cy as a fundamental pillar of European integration . 
Mr President , the Pro## di multi## annual financial package is now refer## red to as the Barros## o multi## annual financial package , as long as it is bas## ed on 1.1## 4 % , al## though to me , 1 % , 1.1## 4 % , 1.2## 4 % .## .. is not of the es## s## ence . 
the real debate is about the question whet## her we are prepar## ed to actual## ly pay for the political priorit## ies include## d in the new European Constitution . 
it is a case of put## ting your money where your mouth is , there## fore . 
it is precise## ly in that area that our citizen## s have seen European leader## ship fail too often . 
I have six observ## ations to make . 
the first is that Europe must be a social Europe , but in most countries , privat## e and public invest## ments in educ## ation and research are trail## ing be## hind . 
the cut## s are harsh at 3 % , but there is not en## ough room for extra invest## ments in research and educ## ation . 
the gold## en rule is not an opt## ion in the St## ability Pact . 
second## ly , we are not prepar## ed to make the real s## witch from agri## cultural subsid## y to r## ural and environment## al policy for the sake of internal social cohes## ion and our priorit## y , which is knowledge . 
this would creat## e actual room for knowledge innov## ation in the country## side and in the urban area## s , with priorit## y be## ing give## n to the ten new ac## ceding countries . 
in Europe , we say in the Constitution that we want Europe to have a central role in the world . 
at present , one in f## ive people a## cross the globe have no access to educ## ation or health care . 
we talk about mill## ennium object## ive## s and about 20## 15 , but what we see are , in fact , level## s of spend## ing by the EU Member State## s and by the EU it## self that are far be## low par in this respect , de## spite re## solution## s by this House . 
we want the Commission &apos;## s new plan## s and the Commission communic## ation about development policy to be give## n priorit## y in Janu## ary , with broad back## ing from Parliament , for these mill## ennium object## ive## s in Head## ing 4 : 35 % for the mill## ennium object## ive## s and 20 % for basic educ## ation and basic health care . 
Mr Bor## rell was right in say## ing that if it is not in the budget , th## en it does not exist . 
that , th## en , is why we want it . 
the four## th is that bad European leader## ship is at it## s most prominent in external policy , with major decision## s , but no fund## ing . 
we want a Middle East policy over## night , and we get the fund## ing from the budget to fight p## over## ty in Africa . 
we want a new neighbour## hood policy . 
all well and good , but the money is o## nce again take## n from the budget to fight p## over## ty in Asia and C## ent## ral America . 
e## ach object## ive deserve## s it## s own budget . 
we should not have to shift fund## ing a## round . 
the fifth is that we want national fraud and account## ant cert## ification bureau## s in order to guarantee swift and fraud @## -## @ proof implement## ation and sub## sequent approval in e## ach country . 
we are s## till far too vulner## able on that score . 
six## th## ly and final## ly , the public want## s to see that e## ach country make## s a fair contribut## ion to the combin## ed European budget accord## ing to it## s own capacity . 
if that is 1 % or 1.1## 5 % , s## o be it ; as long as it is done accord## ing to the capacity and the mean## s of e## ach country . equal share## s . 
that appli## es to the N## ether## land## s as well as to other countries . 
on## ly th## en will we receiv## e the support of our European citizen## s for a tru## ly serious policy . 
Mr President , the European Union &apos;## s new financial frame## work is prob## ably the big## gest issue that Parliament ha## s to resolv## e this term . 
it is not just the volume of EU fund## ing that is at issue , but what futur## e action is to consist of in general . 
the first serious disagree## ment a## mong the Member State## s concern## s the ex## tent of financ## ing . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al is bas## ed on the payment appropri## ations , which on average would amount to 1.1## 4 % of G## DP . 
the propos## al by six countries for a ceil## ing on expend## iture of 1 % is a string## ent one . 
it does not even reflect the ex## tent of next year &apos;## s budget , al## though the transit## ion phase for the new Member State## s is on## ly just start## ing . 
a call ha## s now be## en ma## de for joint li## ability . 
will it end when it is a matter of money ? 
an## other problem is the call for a re## bate on contribut## ions by the large## st net contribut## ors , known as the &apos; general## ised correct## ion mechan## ism . &quot; 
that does not seem fair , as these same Member State## s also benefit most from the s## ing## le market . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al put## s great emphasis on im## prov## ing employ## ment and competitive## ness . 
in my opinion , that is absolut## e## ly the right focus . 
there have al## read## y be## en en## ough re## solution## s . 
indus## try and enter## prise can## not succeed if there is no serious research and development work . 
on the other hand , research is s## o expensive that no Member State on it## s own can compete , for ex## ample , with the Unit## ed State## s of America or Ja## pan . 
for that reason , European co## operation is need## ed . 
we al## read## y have ex## ample## s of this in the field## s of space technology and p## article research . 
the creation of new research programme## s must be bas## ed on the pre## mis## e that the## y will focus on project## s that call for Europe @## -## @ wide co## operation . 
the## y must not be allow## ed to become bureaucrat## ic Struct## ural Fund## s programme## s , the like of which we have now . 
there must also be more substanti## al production of train## ing course## s in connect## ion with programme## s of research . 
it is ver## y import## ant that we should agree on the futur## e financial frame## work next year . 
th## en we would avoid the sort of mess we saw at the start of the Ag## enda 20## 00 programme , which was delay## ed , result## ing in serious delay## s in the draft## ing of sever## al programme## s . 
Mr President , in my one minute of s## peak## ing time I s## hall focus on regional policy and specific## ally the risk that there may not be a regional policy for some states after the conclusion of the negoti## ations on the financial perspective## s . 
Commission## er , I welcome your commit## ment to the origin## al Commission propos## al## s , al## though we have heard from other source## s that the Commission - some## where - is prepar## ing for alter## native out## come## s . 
I would ask you to consider publish## ing what ana## lysis you have car## ried out of alter## native out## come## s of the financial perspective## s . 
that would be particular## ly helpful to the debate with## in our own nation @## -## @ states . 
my own country , the UK - as oppose## d to my own nation , Scot## land - is put## ting forward a position that is as un## construct## ive as it is un## clear . 
an object## ive ana## lysis of what the UK position would mean in term## s of number## s and political ram## ification## s would be a huge## ly helpful contribut## ion to the debate . 
the UK contribut## ion to the debate thu## s far , with it## s position on the UK re## bate , the statistic## al effect , the national## isation of structural fund## s and the limit## ing of the EU budget to one per cent of G## NI is nothing less th## an a cumul## ative act of vandal## ism . 
an object## ive ana## lysis of this contribut## ion from the Commission would be a ver## y helpful deba## ting tool for us in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom . 
Madam President , the long @## -## @ term financial perspective is an import## ant document . 
it will place a restrict## ion on the annual budget## s right up until 20## 13 . 
this will be cruc## ial to cho## ice## s of area## s and to how great a commit## ment the EU can assume d## uring the next seven to eight year## s . 
in re## cent days , the Commission ha## s present## ed it## s view of the long @## -## @ term budget . 
the new Commission ha## s take## n over the old Commission &apos;## s propos## al , or what is known as the Pro## di package . 
this mean## s a significant rise in expend## iture . 
in the case of some countries , it is a question of a 50 % real increas## e . 
that is some## thing I find un## accept## able . 
my view is that the new Commission should have listen## ed more close## ly to the view## s of the six large## st net contribut## ors . 
the## y demand## ed that the financial perspective should include an expend## iture ceil## ing of 1 % of gross national in## come . 
there should be a ceil## ing not on## ly for payment## s , but also for commit## ments . 
it is not accept## able , as the Commission propos## es , to allow the commit## ments to prolife## rate to 1.2## 7 % of gross national in## come . 
that is the upper limit that the Member## s have under## take## n to pay . 
after 20## 13 , there will be no way of expand## ing over and above general economic grow## th un## less all the countries agree to give up the## ir right of veto . 
that is not some## thing I believ## e the## y will do . 
the Commission there## fore propos## es that the EU introduce some form of EU tax . 
we are definite## ly and strong## ly oppose## d to the EU &apos;## s be## ing give## n it## s own right of tax## ation . 
with## out monitor## ing by the individual Member State## s , there is no limit upon the EU &apos;## s ambit## ion to grow in## to a federal super## state . 
e## ach Member State should allow it## s parliament to vot## e on the EU &apos;## s financial perspective be## fore the Council of Minister## s take## s it## s decision s## o that the decision is not take## n secret## ly but open## ly and clear## ly , with people aware of the financial commit## ments the## y will assume . 
s## o that the national parliament## s might be provid## ed with a sound bas## is for the## ir decision## s , the Commission should prepar## e a draft alter## native perspective contain## ed with## in the 1 % expend## iture ceil## ing we have propos## ed . 
there is other## wise a palp## able risk of the Commission &apos;## s ultimate## ly be## ing force## d in## to ill thought @## -## @ out cut## back## s in expend## iture and commit## ments , in## stead of having proper## ly consider## ed priorit## ising that make## s it possible to keep the promise## s ma## de to the new countries . 
the debate will now be suspend## ed and will resum## e at 9 p.m . 
the next item is Que## s## tion Time , with question## s to the Commission ( B## 6 @## -## @ 1## 36 / 20## 04 ) . 
. 
the re## cent case of contamin## ation demonst## rated that the European Comm## un## ity al## read## y ha## s the necess## ary integrate## d legisl## ation to manage s## uch situ## ations in a suit## able mann## er . 
that is why the question of additional measure## s is not be## ing ra## ised , at least not for the moment , the question be## ing the need to app## ly exist## ing measure## s correct## ly . 
programme## s for monitor## ing dioxin## s and P## CB## s in food and feed## ing## stuff## s are appli## ed through## out the European Union . 
Τ## h## ese programme## s have allow## ed the Dutch author## ities to ident## ify the contamin## ation and take suit## able measure## s to ex## terminate it## s source . 
there are monitor## ing and ident## ification system## s for ident## ifying the under## taking## s and live## stock unit## s which may have be## en contamin## ated . 
in order to prevent the introdu## ction of possibly contamin## ated food and feed## ing## stuff## s in## to the food chain , the necess## ary contain## ment measure## s have be## en take## n for these install## ations . 
the ear## ly warn## ing system for food and feed## ing## stuff## s operate## d with particular efficiency as regard## s the exchange of inform## ation between the competent author## ities . 
the adopt## ion by the European Union of upper limit## s for dioxin## s play## ed a prim## ary role in the manage## ment of this case of contamin## ation . 
it is in## de## ed a legal tool for taking decision## s which safeguard the protection of public health . 
how## ever , we must admit that it is not possible to total## ly exclude the possibil## ity of contamin## ation of the food chain . 
the risk will al## ways remain , which is why we have adopt## ed the measure## s need## ed for us to ident## ify and combat s## uch risk## s . 
it is , how## ever , of immens## e import## ance to the protection of public health that contamin## ation be ident## ified in the ear## ly stag## es through monitor## ing and for us to have rule## s which prevent and avert further contamin## ation of the food chain . 
current Comm## un## ity legisl## ation al## read## y include## s s## uch provision## s . 
non## e## the## less , the case of contamin## ation which we are discuss## ing today demonst## rates the need to evalu## ate the safety not on## ly of the ing## red## ient## s of food and feed## ing## stuff## s , but also of the product## s which are us## ed direct## ly or in## direct## ly in the prepar## ation of food and feed## ing## stuff## s . 
food safety legisl## ation stipul## ate## s that food and feed## ing## stuff manufacture## rs are respons## ible for product safety . 
the Commission will continu## e to emphasis## e this oblig## ation to manufacture## rs and to monitor the control## s car## ried out under the respons## ibility of the competent national age## ncies in order to safeguard compliance with current require## ments . 
final## ly , as far as landfill## s are concern## ed , Comm## un## ity legisl## ation ha## s be## en adopt## ed in order to ensu## re that landfill## s are design## ed and operate## d in a way which does not jeopard## ise human health or the environment . 
- Madam President , Commission## er , the necess## ary tool## s for man## aging risk## s and safeguard## ing public health are , on the one hand , the adopt## ion of maxim## um limit## s for dioxin## s in feed## ing## stuff sub## stance## s , feed## ing## stuff## s and food at strict but feasible level## s which will become strict## er as time go## es by and , on the other hand , the apportion## ment of respons## ibility at all stag## es of the food chain at which dioxin## s are ident## ified . 
how## ever , the weak link in the chain for the success of this endeavour are the control mechan## ism## s , e## special## ly in the feed## ing## stuff## s sector , where the link with public health is not direct## ly perceiv## ed by citizen## s and aware## ness at production level is lower th## an with food . 
this ha## s also be## en prov## en by the fact that the root cause of re## cent major food problem## s ha## s be## en dioxin## s in feed## ing## stuff## s . 
what action do you intend to take to strength## en and fort## ify the exist## ing model of feed## ing## stuff control mechan## ism## s s## o that control## s at bo## th European level and at the level of Member State## s are more efficient ? 
. 
I should like to add that , as far as upper limit## s on dioxin## s are concern## ed , the## y have al## read## y be## en set and there are strict standard## s . 
at the same time , emphasis ha## s be## en plac## ed through## out the food chain not on## ly on the final product of feed## ing## stuff## s , but also on the production mechan## ism and , for this reason , the instrument## s us## ed for production will also be control## led . 
I should also like to inform the honour## able Member that we s## hall s## oon be adopt## ing a regulation on feed## ing## stuff hygien## e with the object## ive of lay## ing down strict rule## s and the critical step## s in the production process at which all hygien## e rule## s will need to be adopt## ed and I think that this will address the honour## able Member &apos;## s concern## s . 
. Madam President , the E## mission## s Tr## ading Direct## ive does not contain any provision## s re## l## ating to administ## rative charge## s . 
the application and level of s## uch charge## s are there## fore matter## s for the national govern## ments . 
we know that Member State## s have adopt## ed different approach## es to char## ging for the issue of permit## s under Direct## ive 96 / 61 / EC concern## ing integrate## d poll## ution prevent## ion and control . 
the author## ities respons## ible for issu## ing permit## s incur cost## s , and e## ach Member State is able to decide how it want## s to finance th## ose cost## s . 
the Commission does not there## fore have any estimate## s of the total level of administ## rative charge## s impose## d on CO## 2 emit## ter## s . 
I would also like to say that I am standing in for Mr Dim## as , who s## end## s hi## s apolog## ies be## cause he is attend## ing the Con## ference of Parti## es to the Unit## ed Nation## s Convent## ion on Cli## mate Change . 
as you know , it is a ver## y import## ant conference and he ha## s ask## ed me to stand in for him . 
thank you , Commission## er . 
would you not agree , though , that differ## ing administ## rative charge## s consider## ably distort the internal market , and that this lead## s to vary## ing competit## ion conditio## ns in individual Member State## s ? 
would you also agree that , in certain Member State## s , the administ## rative charge## s are significant## ly high## er th## an the administ## rative expend## iture actual## ly incur## red , and that it may be necess## ary for the Commission to make improve## ments here to safeguard the internal market ? 
. these charge## s may vary between Member State## s and be absent in some case## s . 
but this is no different from other tax## es and charge## s that vary between Member State## s and have implic## ations for comp## an## ies . 
in the end , it is a political decision for e## ach Member State to take as to whet## her it want## s to finance administ## rative cut## s like this through the general budget , or via direct charge## s . 
since the question of charge## s for issu## ing green## house gas e## mission permit## s is not with## in the Commission &apos;## s compete## nce , the Commission ha## s no over## view of how much e## ach Member State current## ly charge## s for issu## ing green## house gas e## mission permit## s under the E## mission## s Tr## ading Direct## ive . 
the review of the E## mission## s Tr## ading Direct## ive will start ear## ly in 20## 05 . 
it will be a major s## take## holder survey and will cover a broad range of issue## s , including the effect of the schem## e on the extra @## -## @ Comm## un## ity competitive## ness of European comp## an## ies . 
Commission## er , e## mission trad## ing certifi## cate## s are a ver## y import## ant aspect of the European Union &apos;## s meet## ing it## s Kyoto object## ive## s . 
it seem## s to me ver## y un## satisfactory that you are not able to inform the Member of the current state of play as regard## s e## ach individual Member State . 
will the Commission , in mov## ing to## ward## s a review in 20## 05 , survey the 25 Member State## s to establish what is the exist## ing practice and ensu## re that a level play## ing field is creat## ed post @## -## @ 20## 05 ? 
. as I s## aid , the review of the e## mission## s trad## ing direct## ive will start at the begin## ning of 20## 05 . 
it will be a major s## take## holder survey and will cover a broad range of issue## s . 
I can forward your question to my colleague## s and per## hap## s ask them to carry out a stu## dy s## o that we can compar## e the situ## ation in e## ach country . 
it seem## s reason## able to me to have this inform## ation but I repeat that tax## ation and charge## s are not the compete## nce of our Commission . 
it is up to e## ach Member State to decide the level of charge## s and tax## ation , as is the case for other product## s . 
. the Commission is well aware of the problem of piracy , particular## ly in it## s most re## cent and exacerb## ated form via the Inter## net . 
I fully share the honour## able Member &apos;## s view that this phenomenon is ver## y dam## aging to the cultural indus## tries and I am determine## d to do the ut## most to get piracy level## s as low as possible . 
the Commission establish## ed a high @## -## @ level group on digital right## s manage## ment system## s in Mar## ch 20## 04 , as part of the e## Europe 20## 05 A## ction Plan . 
the high @## -## @ level group &apos;## s final report , present## ed on 8 Ju## ly , reflect## s a con## sensus on basic principle## s and re## commend## ations for futur## e action## s in three area## s , one of which is the migration to legitimate service## s . 
encourag## ing consum## ers to use legitimate on## line service## s is fundamental to the creation of a thriv## ing e @## -## @ content market . 
the digital right## s manage## ment system## s will play an essential part , en## ab## ling new business model## s and prevent## ing un## author## ised use . 
re## commend## ations include## d active## ly promot## ing aware## ness a## mong consum## ers of legitimate alter## native offer## ing## s and the need to creat## e consum## er con## fidence . 
regard## ing the situ## ation out## side the EU border## s , also address## ed by the honour## able Member , on 10 N## ov## ember 20## 04 the Commission adopt## ed a strate## gy for the enforce## ment of intellectual proper## ty right## s in thir## d countries . 
this strate## gy set## s the guide## line## s for the coming year## s to## ward## s a reduction of the level of intellectual proper## ty right## s viol## ations taking place beyond the EU border## s . 
over and above technical co## operation and assist## ance , enforce## ment , regulator## y implement## ation and bilateral and multilateral monitor## ing , the Commission will foster aware## ness @## -## @ ra## ising of us## ers and consum## ers in thir## d countries and support the creation of public @## -## @ privat## e partner## ships for enforce## ment . 
there are a number of programme## s that also cover intellectual proper## ty right## s and include aware## ness and educ## ation : for ex## ample , E## CAP , which is an intellectual proper## ty programme for the A## SEA## N countries ; the Cotonou Agreement for the Africa## n , Car## ib## bean and Pacific countries , and the CAR## D## S programme for the countries of the Balkan## s . 
thank you , Commission## er , for that answer . 
the point is that all th## ose measure## s are perfect## ly valid and , as you explain## ed , deal with all the different aspect## s of protect## ing intellectual proper## ty . 
the specific problem I tri## ed to ra## ise is whet## her the Commission will focus particular## ly on the area where Member State## s have few## er instrument## s to deal with this , show## ing what is be## hind the protection of intellectual proper## ty and ra## ising aware## ness a## mong citizen## s . 
this is prob## ably one of the few case## s where criminal code## s are violate## d by citizen## s with## out them know## ing that the## y are do## ing s## o , and even think## ing that it is some## thing posit## ive to do . 
s## o what do you intend to do to show , through general campaign## s or what## ever , that this is a ver## y import## ant matter and that the futur## e of the audio## visual indus## try in Europe is at s## take ? 
. the Commission will continu## e monitor## ing what is going on in individual Member State## s . 
vari## ous Member State## s s## uch as the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , France and Germa## ny have al## read## y put in place large @## -## @ scale educ## ation and aware## ness programme## s . 
the Commission does not have more resource## s th## an Member State## s . 
it is a matter prim## arily for Member State## s to ensu## re that the point you have valid## ly ra## ised is more wide## ly known , a## long with the problem## s that arise from un## licens## ed and illegal copy## ing . 
I am inform## ed that the black market value of illegal CD## s and DVD## s is three time## s that of can## na## bi## s , and the profit margin## s are eight @## -## @ fold . 
there## fore it is a much more profit## able activity , with lower risk## s of be## ing caught and lower penal## ties . 
it is thu## s in the interest## s of the Member State## s to ensu## re that aware## ness measure## s are in place in an ef## fort to stop this activity . 
. first of all I would like to say that the question of the seat of the European Parliament is cover## ed by Protocol No 8 on the establish## ment of the seat## s of the institution## s , specific organisation## s and service## s of the European Comm## un## ities s## uch as Euro## pol , and is annex## ed to the Treat## y of Amsterdam . 
the question of the location of the institution## s ha## s had a ver## y high priorit## y and concern## s a high level of decision @## -## @ making , re## l## ating not on## ly to the location of our institution## s in Bru## ssels and Strasbourg , but also to Luxembourg . 
this concern## s a ver## y high @## -## @ level political decision . 
for the Commission the total cost of mission## s of official## s to Strasbourg amount## ed to EUR 1.7 million in 20## 03 . 
this include## s all the cost## s of mission## s , including th## ose of Commission official## s and member## s of Commission## ers &apos; office## s . 
s## o this is not a large amount of money . 
a s## light## ly high## er amount is forecast for the futur## e . 
you ask## ed about all the cost## s for the Union . 
we do not have a ver## y precise over## view of all cost## s , but we know that for the European Parliament the cost## s are much high## er . 
accord## ing to the Mar## ch 20## 04 report by Mr van Hu## lten , MEP , the total cost of having part @## -## @ session## s in bo## th Bru## ssels and Strasbourg amount## s to about EUR 200 million annual## ly . 
Mr van Hu## lten favour## ed Bru## ssels as the s## ing## le seat of Parliament and he was support## ed by Parliament &apos;## s Committee on Budget## ary Control . 
the Commission is not in a position to judge the function## ing of the European Parliament . 
Madam President , Commission## er , I appreci## ate the difficult## ies with the figure## s be## cause there are s## o man## y of us who have to be mov## ed between these two seat## s . 
it is not on## ly a cost in term## s of money but also a cost to the environment , which I think is in## cred## ibly import## ant . 
I find it extreme## ly difficult to defend these journey## s to people in Europe and Swede## n when the## y ask question## s about this issue . 
we are concern## ed here with a lot of money , which we could spend on man## y other import## ant issue## s with## in the EU . 
I think this issue is import## ant , and we should ra## ise it as often as possible until we are able to have a s## ing## le seat for our work , hope## fully in Bru## ssels . 
. that is your opinion . 
as I s## aid , the location of the European institution## s was decide## d in 19## 57 and it ha## s continu## ed to be a ver## y high level of political decision @## -## @ making . 
the Commission is read## y to discuss all these issue## s . 
it is ver## y difficult to estimate the cost## s to the environment , but the amount of money in our budget for 20## 03 was EUR 1.7 million . 
Madam President , Commission## er , do you agree with me that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament , that it is on## ly by way of a concession in order to reduce bureau## cracy in it## s co## operation with the other European institution## s that it migrate## s to Bru## ssels , and that it## s principal seat is here in Strasbourg ? 
do you also agree with me that the figure of EUR 200 million that you have give## n for annual expend## iture refer## s not to the extra cost## s , but to the total cost## s of running this House ? 
. the location of European institution## s can## not be consider## ed on## ly from the view## point of the cost## s involve## d . 
this is a ver## y import## ant political matter . 
in hi## s report , Mr van Hu## lten put these cost## s at about EUR 200 million , most of which we## re incur## red as a result of travel between Bru## ssels and Strasbourg and vice versa . 
I do not have more precise figure## s , but the over## all cost## s of Parliament , as can be## en seen in the budget , are high## er . 
y## es , Madam President , Commission## er , this question ha## s obvi## ously come up repeat## ed## ly since we have be## en in this magnificent Chamber , and I believ## e we would all like to have a s## ing## le place of work , that is tru## e . 
we all want to cut cost## s , we all want to cut waste , we all want to cut poll## ution , but I think the question today is the location of the seat of the European Parliament . 
today it is in Strasbourg , and I think France and the citizen## s of Strasbourg are happy to welcome it and are do## ing all the## y can to make us feel at home . 
for my part , I would like to know whet## her a stu## dy ha## s be## en car## ried out to find out whet## her there re## ally is a differ## ence , be## cause any journey to Bru## ssels or Strasbourg represent## s a cost , which is the same for every## one . 
whet## her Member## s travel to Strasbourg or to Bru## ssels , I do not there## fore believ## e it is re## ally worth making a fuss about this seat every time . 
it is re## ally a political question for our political author## ities . 
. this is a political question and I have no comment## s on it . 
this was decide## d in 19## 57 . 
I can assure you that the Commission ha## s no intention of propos## ing any change## s on this complic## ated matter . 
. I am ver## y happy to re## ply to this question , be## cause im## mediate## ly after I was design## ated as the Commission## er respons## ible for sever## al area## s , including OLAF , I was approach## ed and ask## ed how to go a## head with vari## ous project## s and propos## al## s on the futur## e of OLAF , including possible manage## ment decision## s . 
sever## al different opt## ions we## re propos## ed . one was to fill this post through an open competit## ion . 
I promise## d that I would express my opinion after the formal## ities we## re over . 
the formal## ities we## re complete## d on 22 N## ov## ember and im## mediate## ly after the new Commission start## ed we ma## de the decision to advertise this post and fill it through an open competit## ion . 
today we receiv## ed the final opinion of the legal service## s about some nuanc## es concern## ing the announce## ment . 
a few days ago I receiv## ed the first version of the job de## script## ion , s## o the post will be advertise## d ver## y s## oon . 
there will th## en be an open competit## ion . 
I would like to know how the new time schedul## e look## s now , and what time ha## s be## en allocate## d to Parliament to hear the candid## ate## s . 
. the Commission realis## es clear## ly that this is a specific post and that Parliament and Council must be consult## ed on the appoint## ment of the Director . 
the dead## line is 1 Mar## ch , which is when the term expir## es . 
if we publish it now , the competit## ion procedure will be quit## e short . 
I hope that at the begin## ning of next year we will have en## ough time to consult with the relev## ant parliament## ary committee and the Council about propos## ed candid## ate## s . 
we will try to s## elect candid## ate## s as s## oon as possible and th## en start the consult## ation with Parliament . 
the Commission ha## s no intention of re## duc## ing Parliament &apos;## s role in this ver## y sensitiv## e matter . 
in the absence of the Member who put it , Que## s## tion 37 laps## es . 
. the honour## able Member &apos;## s question cover## ed two area## s : first## ly cultural divers## ity , plural## ism and in## depend## ence and second## ly achiev## ing a knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed econom## y . 
cultural divers## ity is enshrine## d in Comm## un## ity law , main## ly in the Amsterdam Protocol . 
the second aspect is an innov## ation @## -## @ encourag## ing and technology @## -## @ wel## coming strate## gy . 
bo## th these object## ive## s have a vital role to play in the futur## e EU . 
Comm## un## ity law does not exclude the possibil## ity of defi## ning new media service## s as a public service . 
how## ever , new technologies must be embrac## ed by all actor## s - bo## th public and privat## e - for a success## ful inform## ation soci## ety for all . 
this mean## s that appropriate public service oblig## ations may be need## ed and impose## d in the environment of these new technologies . 
the Commission communic## ation of 20## 01 on the application of state aid rule## s to public service broadcast## ing confirm## s that the Member State## s are respons## ible for the financ## ing and definition of public service broadcast## ing . 
in that communic## ation the Commission does not exclude the possibil## ity that certain on @## -## @ line activities could be perform## ed as a public service . 
thu## s Member State## s may take appropriate action## s to achiev## e the object## ive## s mention## ed . 
how## ever , I should like to remind you that other media play## ers - bo## th exist## ing oper## ators and new ent## rant## s - have a role to play in contribut## ing to plural## ism , cultural divers## ity , innov## ation , competitive## ness and consum## er cho## ice . 
Madam President , thank you ver## y much for your answer . 
my question is bas## ed on the fact that there are man## y who would limit the opportun## ities for public service to operate . 
limit## ing public service by ban## ning the use of certain technology is just one way of do## ing this . 
there are also th## ose who see the new TV direct## ive , as well as the propos## ed service## s direct## ive , as a way of limit## ing public service . 
how is the Commission to ensu## re that these direct## ive## s in particular do not encroach upon the right of the Member State## s them## selves to define what public service is and what conditio## ns s## hall app## ly to the public service comp## an## ies ? 
. Madam President , there is a hiera## rchy of direct## ive## s , and the direct## ive concern## ed with tele## vision is the Tele## vision with## out Front## iers Direct## ive . 
the Treat## y is also import## ant , and the Amsterdam Protocol is ver## y clear on the matter . 
that is why , in order to emphasis## e legal certain## ty , the Commission publish## ed it## s communic## ation on state aid to public tele## vision in 20## 01 , and why it express## ly include## d the opt## ion for Member State## s of afford## ing the Inter## net , a## mong other thing## s , the same treat## ment as public tele## vision , provid## ed the Inter## net is part of the public sector and subject to the same oblig## ations . 
. Madam President , I must also say in this connect## ion that the Commission is the guard## ian of the Treat## ies , and that it ha## s al## ways done what is necess## ary to ensu## re compliance with the competit## ion rule## s , in particular the provision## s concern## ing State aid in the field of broadcast## ing . 
s## till on this question , I would like to add that the 20## 01 communic## ation on State aid to public service broadcast## ing clar## ifies the way in which the relev## ant rule## s must be appli## ed . 
it explain## s clear## ly , should there s## till be any need to do s## o , that Member State## s are respons## ible for financ## ing this public service and for defi## ning it## s remit , and that it is not for the Commission to decide whet## her a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be . 
the Commission look## s on## ly at whet## her the definition of the remit and the financ## ing correspond to the re## ality on the ground . 
the import## ant thing in the eye## s of the Commission is there## fore that the remit be define## d as clear## ly and precise## ly as possible , and that if a public service go## es beyond it## s public remit it should keep separat## e account## s for commercial activities s## uch as the sale of advert## ising space , for ex## ample . 
thank you for your re## ply , Mr## s R## ed## ing . 
thank you for clar## ifying s## o precise## ly what we al## read## y know to be laid down in Comm## un## ity legisl## ation . 
the purpose of my question , Commission## er , was to try to go a li## ttle further . 
in all the countries of the European Union , we often note that , in accord## ance with that interpret## ation of our rule## s , which you have clar## ified s## o well , there is often - s## hall we say - per## verse behaviour that transgress## es free competit## ion . 
do you believ## e that we could seek to produce a new formula## tion , a new text , which is able to bring together the public service crite## ria in a clear## er mann## er ? 
. the honour## able Member is well aware that the Commission can## not go beyond the exist## ing text## s . 
how## ever , as talk## s are current## ly be## ing held with the indus## try about a possible re## vision of the Tele## vision with## out Front## iers Direct## ive , this is the time to put an## other definition on the table , if need be . 
I am there## fore wait## ing to see what the public and privat## e sector## s have to say on the matter . 
I would also like to say to the honour## able Member that if the privat## e sector fil## es a complain## t for un## fair competit## ion , the Commission take## s up that complain## t , examin## es whet## her the public sector is right or wrong and grant## s or reject## s the re## quest## s ma## de . 
one might mention a number of interest## ing author## isation## s which are case## s in point ; for ex## ample , State aid to and to was allow## ed , as was aid to and other programme## s of the same kind , be## cause the## y we## re compatible with the rule## s . 
other## s we## re amend## ed or reject## ed . 
we s## till have case## s that are be## ing examin## ed , and you can be s## ure , Mr Herr## ero @## -## @ Te## j## ed## or , that the Commission tries to app## ly the rule## s every time , and to ensu## re that there can be free competit## ion between a public sector and a privat## e sector which must not be stifle## d . 
. the honour## able Member ra## ised the issue of the provision of sub## tit## ling and audio de## script## ion last year in Parliament &apos;## s re## solution on tele## vision with## out front## iers . 
it is certain that digital broadcast## ing offer## s improve## d sub## tit## ling and audio de## script## ion when compar## ed with the ana## logue system . 
there are al## read## y standard## s for these service## s . 
I see the s## witch## over to digital tele## vision as an opportun## ity for enhance## d service## s of this type . 
it is not a threat . 
as I told Parliament at my hear## ing in Sept## ember , I believ## e that the development of new technologies must be to the benefit of citizen## s and of the## ir wel## fare . 
that is why my service## s will short## ly publish a call for tender## s , launch## ing a stu## dy on access## ibility to digital tele## vision . 
this stu## dy will focus on develop## ing policy model## s in order to help Member State## s implement assist## ive service## s . 
I would also like to say that there is no require## ment in European law for broadcast## ers in Member State## s to provid## e sub## tit## ling and audio de## script## ions . 
provision of assist## ive service is hand## led under the subsid## i## arity principle , but there are of course some area## s co## ordinate## d at Comm## un## ity level by the Tele## vision With## out Front## iers Direct## ive . 
with## in the frame## work of this direct## ive , I have call## ed on the contact committee to provid## e inform## ation on the measure## s take## n by the Member State## s in order to enhance the opportun## ities for access of visual## ly## - and hear## ing @## -## @ impair## ed people to tele## vision programme## s . 
we are now in the process of collect## ing and ana## ly## s## ing the Member State## s &apos; re## plies . 
our aim is to promot## e best practice a## mong regulator## s and indus## try group## s and we will work with Member State## s to promot## e avail## ability of assist## ive service## s and to foster an economic## ally vi## able market for equip## ment that address## es access## ibility need## s . 
the Commission## er will not be surprise## d that with a new Commission we ra## ise these issue## s o## nce again . 
in fact , s## he would prob## ably be surprise## d if we di## d not . 
I accept what s## he say## s in relation to the Tele## vision with## out Front## iers Direct## ive , but I would ask her to keep a ver## y close eye on this issue . 
subsid## i## arity is a fine thing , but s## he will know that the European Union ha## s be## en fund## ing conference## s on sub## tit## ling for some 20 year## s and more , and that the actual increas## e in it## s incidence a## mong broadcast## ers is ver## y limit## ed in## de## ed . 
will s## he , for ex## ample , ensu## re that a benchmark## ing process take## s place s## o that we see a gradual increas## e year by year ? 
can s## he today comment on when s## he will bring forward the result## s of the ana## lysis that s## he ha## s under## take## n in relation to the contact group and in what form s## he will do s## o ; and can s## he give hope to blind and deaf people through## out Europe that better tele## vision service## s will prevail ? 
. I would like to assure the honour## able Member that I re## member hi## s letter of 25 N## ov## ember 20## 03 on the subject ver## y well . 
now that I am respons## ible not on## ly for the Tele## vision with## out Front## iers Direct## ive but also for the new media in general , I will certain## ly put even more weight on this question th## an I di## d be## fore . 
the answer to the honour## able Member &apos;## s question is that the stu## dy on the policy model## s will start at the begin## ning of 20## 05 and will finish rough## ly one year later , between the begin## ning and middle of 20## 06 . 
as for the Con## tact Committee , it## s work is continu## ing and the result## s will be publish## ed on the web in ear## ly 20## 05 . 
the Commission## er will be aware that I have be## en ra## ising with her the question of the broadcast## ing of the English Premier## ship on tele## vision . 
the Commission## er ha## s re## plied that broad## band Inter## net may be a possibil## ity for broadcast## ing this with## out restrict## ion . 
if broad## band Inter## net is to be us## ed as a new way of provid## ing more wide## spread communic## ation , could I ask the Commission## er if s## he would also consider introdu## c## ing provision## s in the new propos## al## s s## he is put## ting forward to ensu## re that broad## band Inter## net broadcast## ing arrange## ments also include some suit## able sub## tit## ling for the kind of people mention## ed in the question ? 
. Madam President , the Commission is obvi## ously require## d to be neutral in matter## s of technology . 
what is tru## e for one technology must be tru## e for an## other , and we must show person## s who have difficult## ies in particip## ating fully in the inform## ation soci## ety the same respect regard## less of the technology . 
in sub## stance , there## fore , it does not change any## thing , but in form , of course , it does , and where we are encourag## ing broad## band technology , person## s with sight or hear## ing problem## s must obvi## ously be assist## ed . 
incident## ally , we are see## ing , for ex## ample , that thir## d @## -## @ generation tele## phone## s re## ally do allow us to meet these person## s &quot; need## s ; the## y en## able the hard of hear## ing to use the tele## phone by transmit## ting an im## age of the lip## s . 
. Madam President , I would like to say to Mr E## bn## er that the Tele## vision with## out Front## iers Direct## ive lay## s down the principle that tele## vision advert## ising and tele## shop## ping must be kept separat## e from other part## s of the programme by optic## al and acoustic mean## s . 
the Direct## ive also states that surreptitious advert## ising and tele## shop## ping are prohibit## ed . 
as I have al## read## y s## aid in answer to pre## vi## ous question## s , the Direct## ive is be## ing review## ed , and the public consult## ation held in 20## 03 allow## ed the vari## ous part## ies concern## ed to express the## ir view## s . 
some oper## ators are in fact in favour of making the rule on advert## ising more flex## ible to take account of changing technology by allow## ing split screen## s , for ex## ample , or the market## ing of equip## ment that would en## able view## ers to avoid advert## ising mess## age## s . 
how## ever , in 20## 03 there was a con## sensus that advert## ising should be clear## ly ident## ified s## o as to avoid mislead## ing the public . 
that consult## ation di## d not ident## ify any development in Europe of product place## ment advert## ising practice## s that would violate the term## s of the Direct## ive . 
that is why this point was clar## ified in the Commission &apos;## s 20## 03 interpret## ative communic## ation on certain aspect## s of the provision## s on tele## vis## ed advert## ising . 
I am of course prepar## ed to go over all these matter## s again in connect## ion with a possible re## vision of the Direct## ive , which I intend to present in 20## 05 . 
thank you , Madam President . 
I am glad to hear the Commission## er say that s## he will give priorit## y to consum## er protection in this case if there is to be a change of opinion in 20## 05 . 
the fact is that exist## ing practice ha## s not be## en particular## ly satisfactory , with approach## es having be## en take## n that do not protect the consum## er , and some## thing must be done about that . 
. Madam President , I s## hall , th## en , try to set an equal## ly good ex## ample and to keep it brief . 
consum## er protection is of course high up on the age## nda and we will take due account of it ; the Commission is prepar## ed , in rev## ising this Direct## ive , to co## operate close## ly not on## ly with the MEP## s who concern them## selves with consum## er protection , but also with consum## er protection organisation## s . 
. the honour## able Member ask## ed if the Commission## er agree## s with the adjust## ed interpret## ation of paragraph 14 of the Unit## ed K## ing## dom Priv## acy and Elect## ron## ic Communic## ations ( EC Direct## ive ) Regul## ations , 20## 03 , which deal## s with the use of location data . 
since this question is relate## d to an interpret## ation of national law , I would refer the honour## able Member to Mr Rich## ard Thom## as , the In## formation Commission## er in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , who is respons## ible for en## forc## ing these priv## acy and electro## nic communic## ation regulation## s .

as the member of the Commission respons## ible for this direct## ive , I am pleas## ed to indic## ate the follow## ing element## s for the benefit of any national interpret## ation exerc## ise . 
this EU e## Priv## acy Direct## ive provid## es that location data may be us## ed , but on## ly with the consent of the subscrib## er or us## er .

how## ever , the Commission is not of the view that the direct## ive require## s the us## er or subscrib## er to be inform## ed of or consent to the location prior to every s## ing## le attempt by the lo## c## ator to locate him . 
n## ever## the## less , the direct## ive require## s that subscrib## ers and us## ers , even if the## y have subscrib## ed to a location @## -## @ bas## ed service , be able to tempo## r## arily block the locating facilit## y . 
thank you , Commission## er . 
I will take on board your comment## s about refer## ring this back to the UK . 
how## ever , I want to follow this up . 
under the current provision## s , al## though permiss## ion should be s## ought , there are no guarantee## s that it will be . 
if some## body can be track## ed with## out the## ir know## ing it , that ha## s ver## y serious implic## ations . 
for the person be## ing track## ed , the## ir personal securit## y is violate## d ; the## y may be , for in## stance , under the threat of viol## ence . 
there is a whole range of ver## y serious civil lib## er## ties issue## s here . 
I urge you to take this ver## y serious## ly . 
I will take it up in the UK and hope that you will pursu## e it here . 
. I would say to the honour## able Member that if there we## re a problem of that sort , or if inform## ation we## re not ma## de avail## able to the consum## ers , th## en making a complain## t to the national respons## ible body would be the right thing to do . 
. Madam President , the European Commission is of course extreme## ly concern## ed at the man## y human right## s viol## ations , including mass rape## s , taking place in the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go in con## sequenc## e of a long period of conflict . 
the Commission ha## s in fact ma## de support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic transit## ion part of it## s 20## 03 @## -## @ 20## 07 strate## gy for co## operation with the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go . 
this support is a different## iated and complement## ary respons## e to the problem of mass rape## s in that country . 
Comm## un## ity co## operation experience in the health sector go## es back a long way , with EUR 70 million having be## en spent on support programme## s since 19## 92 . 
these programme## s encourag## e access to basic health care and the supply of medicine## s at price## s appropriate to the situ## ation on the ground . 
a new health support programme amount## ing to a## round EUR 70 million will be put in place to consolidate what ha## s be## en achiev## ed by the ear## lier programme## s , and to extend the## ir activities to other area## s re## l## ating to health . 
in it## s global plan for 20## 05 , EC## HO confirm## s it## s support for area## s with a high incidence of sexual viol## ence , in particular in the K## ivu## s and Man## ie## ma . 
project## s design## ed to restore the rule of law and promot## e women &apos;## s right## s are also be## ing fund## ed by the European initiative for demo## cracy and human right## s . 
the Commission is also ver## y active in the field of institutional support . 
since the begin## ning of this year it ha## s in fact be## en assist## ing the B## un## ia court of first in## stance in Ituri , which deal## s with case## s of rape . 
the purpose of this support is to combat imp## un## ity and to pac## ify the region . 
on a more structural level , the Commission is put## ting in place a mechan## ism for partner## ship and support for the Con## go## les## e Govern## ment with a view to reform## ing the justice system . 
this will ultimate## ly en## able the national court## s to deal effective## ly with case## s involv## ing action## s for rape . 
final## ly , envelope B , to which the honour## able Member refer## s in hi## s question , is provid## ing a## round EUR 27 million for ur## gent re## habilit## ation work in Con## go &apos;## s eastern province## s , which are the most serious## ly affect## ed by the conflict and hence by human right## s viol## ations . 
Madam President , grat## e## ful though I am to the Commission## er for hi## s detail## ed re## ply , I s## till have the feel## ing that we are fight## ing a running battle in some ways . 
on## ly a few week## s ago , the President## s of Rwanda and of the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go conclude## d a new peace agree## ment , on## ly to be at e## ach other &apos;## s throat## s again a few days later . 
my own source## s in that country - a number of Catholic priest## s - have report## ed to me that there have be## en man## y gang rape## s . 
o## nce again , thousand## s to ten## s of thousand## s of women have be## en rap## ed . 
the Commission is in## de## ed fund## ing a programme in the region , but should we not look in## to the real root## s of the conflict ? 
we all know that there are mass## ive gain## s to be ma## de from the miner## al resource## s - dia## mond## s , col## tan and gold . 
together with the Council and it## s preside## ncy , should the Commission not be taking action about this ? 
this ha## s be## en going on for year## s . 
I do in## de## ed believ## e , Commission## er , that every## one expect## s you , with your personal de## dic## ation and your personal knowledge of the region , together with your colleague , Mr## s Ferr## ero @## -## @ Wal## d## ner , to have a strong## er and more effective pre## s## ence in that region , and I should like to hear your view on this . 
. Madam President , I ver## y much agree with the honour## able Member . 
as you well know , I am ver## y sensitiv## e to and ver## y concern## ed at the situ## ation in the Great Lake## s countries and , more e## special## ly , by what is happen## ing in eastern Con## go . 
that is why , when I leave you tomor## row morning , I s## hall be fly## ing out there to make a repeat visit to all th## ose countries and to review the situ## ation with the## ir leader## s . 
I am also aware of the renew## ed abuse## s and renew## ed and extreme## ly serious act## s of viol## ence that the region is again witness## ing . 
the problem is not on## ly the ex @## -## @ F## AR / Inter## a## ham## we , there are also group## s of what are re## ally organise## d criminal## s and other## s who are re## ally liv## ing off the back## s of the population and are be## hind what can on## ly be describ## ed as atro## c## ities . 
I s## hall there## fore be tour## ing the capital## s between 15 and 20 Dec## ember . 
I s## hall be meet## ing with th## ose countries &quot; preside## nts and vari## ous people in position## s of respons## ibility , including Unit## ed Nation## s official## s , to see what the international communit## y can re## ally do and , in particular , what the international communit## y is in the end prepar## ed to do . 
we are well aware that the problem will not be solv## ed by the Con## go## les## e arm## y and police . 
the## y are not , at this present time , in a position to do s## o and it would be better to give the Unit## ed Nation## s Miss## ion in the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go ( M## ON## UC ) an## other mandate : it need## s more resource## s in term## s of ability to act on the ground . 
as you are also aware , it## s present mandate does not allow it to disarm people by force , for ex## ample , but on## ly to collect weapon## s from th## ose who are will## ing to hand them over . 
there is there## fore a principle of voluntari## s## m involve## d and I s## hall be try## ing to convince the people with whom I have talk## s . 
first of all , I am going to try and persuade the Rwanda## ns and the Con## go## les## e to keep calm and not to act in h## aste and risk reopen## ing a conflict when the transit## ion process is in full s## wing . 
I am there## fore first going to try to convince them of the necess## ity of pre## serv## ing the transit## ion process . 
th## en I s## hall be do## ing my ut## most to persuade the international communit## y , which is represent## ed in the country by bodies like the Unit## ed Nation## s , of the need to take the necess## ary decision## s to settle this matter o## nce and for all , be## cause , as you s## o right## ly s## aid , the rule of law is no long## er tru## ly a re## ality in that part of the world . 
having s## aid that , the proof that I am in total agree## ment with you is that I am leav## ing to tour the area again tomor## row , and to take stock of the situ## ation on the ground . 
there is the question of elect## ions in Con## go , of the time## table for th## ose elect## ions , and the legisl## ation that s## till ha## s to be pass## ed by the parliament for th## ose elect## ions to be held . 
you are aware , since I have al## read## y s## aid s## o public## ly , that I believ## e the elect## ion time## table should be left un## change## d s## o as to keep up the pressure on the author## ities . 
I am also going to argue in Kigali that there should be no incur## s## ions of Kigali troop## s in## to foreign ter## rit## ory . 
as you see , I am there## fore plan## ning to make an## other complete review of the situ## ation . 
un## fortunate## ly , Mr Sta## es , it is beyond my power to resolv## e the problem my## self , and I can on## ly hope that my power## s of per## suasion will have an effect this time . 
at any rate , believ## e me , I s## hall be voic## ing your concern## s be## cause the## y are my own . 
. Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , over the last few deca## de## s , human## itarian aid workers have operate## d in in## secure and un## predict## able conditio## ns . 
I am s## ure we are all aware that the risk## s the## y run in order to provid## e aid in un## s## table situ## ations have increas## ed consider## ably . 
take the ex## ample## s of Iraq , Côte d &apos;## Ivoire and Dar## fur in particular . 
relief workers have ver## y often , too often in fact , come under attack from the arm## ed force## s and militia## s . 
give## n the difficult conditio## ns in which the Commission , through EC## HO , the Human## itarian Aid Office , and it## s partner## s , is work## ing , it is be## coming increas## ing## ly difficult to get material aid and assist## ance to th## ose who are suffer## ing . 
it also ha## s to be s## aid that the grow## ing involve## ment in human## itarian activities of play## ers who are not strict## ly human## itarian , s## uch as the milit## ary , ha## s some## time## s result## ed in role## s be## coming con## fuse## d , with the con## sequent risk## s for the safety of relief workers . 
in order to pre## serve the exist## ence of a human## itarian space and , con## sequent## ly , to ensu## re that aid and equip## ment reach## es the victim## s , the Commission &apos;## s decision## s are bas## ed on human## itarian value## s and principle## s and on a desir## e to provid## e qual## ity assist## ance through it## s partner## ship with human## itarian organisation## s . 
in accord## ance with the Council &apos;## s rule## s on human## itarian aid , the Commission &apos;## s decision## s are there## fore dictat## ed s## ole## ly by basic human## itarian need## s and principle## s , name## ly neutral## ity , im## partial## ity and in## depend## ence . 
observ## ance of these principle## s should help to protect relief workers and give them access to victim## s in case## s of conflict . 
in order to maintain the distinct## ion between the role## s of the milit## ary and of relief workers , the Commission support## s the key role of civil## ian organisation## s when implement## ing human## itarian measure## s in situ## ations where milit## ary capacity and resource## s are us## ed . 
to do s## o , it maintain## s that s## uch re## course must comp## ly with the guide## line## s for the use of arm## y and civil defence resource## s in complex emerge## ncy human## itarian aid operation## s conduct## ed by the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
EC## HO is not an operation## al organisation . 
it## s task is to finance the co## ordinate## d provision of human## itarian aid through partner organisation## s , for ex## ample international N## GO## s , other international organisation## s or the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
the qual## ity and effective## ness of EC## HO &apos;## s aid depend ver## y much on it## s partner## s &quot; professional abilities . 
all organisation## s sign## ing the partner## ship agree## ment by virtue of which the## y work with EC## HO there## fore commit them## selves to uphold## ing the fundamental human## itarian value## s and principle## s I have just mention## ed . 
the basic object## ive of human## itarian aid is n## either to prevent nor to resolv## e conflict## s , but to allevi## ate the human suffer## ing the## y cause . 
in consult## ation with other sponsor## s and partner## s , EC## HO is active## ly look## ing for ways of tack## ling the grow## ing problem## s of access to victim## s and the safety of relief workers , with the aim of im## prov## ing the situ## ation in that regard . 
govern## ments , arm## ed force## s and non @## -## @ state play## ers need to be ma## de more aware of the## ir oblig## ations under international human## itarian law . 
that law states that the part## ies to a conflict must facilit## ate the pass## age of aid convo## y## s and the provision of neutral assist## ance to civil## ians affect## ed by a conflict . 
to give a real @## -## @ life ex## ample of this principle , when I w## ent to Sudan , to Dar## fur to be more precise , I remind## ed the govern## ment author## ities and the rebel## s that it was absolut## e## ly essential that the## y allow international human## itarian organisation## s free access to the victim## s and the people in need of help . 
that is a fundamental principle and , in quo## ting that ex## ample , I am also stress## ing the import## ance of the political dia## logue between the Commission and th## ose countries &quot; author## ities . 
- Madam President , I should like to thank Commission## er Lou## is Michel for be## ing s## o ver## y analytical on this entire , high## ly import## ant issue , e## special## ly when , ver## y re## cent## ly in the Ivo## ry Coast , there have also be## en force## s belong## ing to a country of the European Union . 
how## ever , my question is a supplement## ary question : ha## s your Commission thought of cut## ting human## itarian aid when it is not clear or certain that it will be us## ed by th## ose in need and there is a possibil## ity of it## s end## ing up in the hand## s of the rebel## s ? 
I ra## ise this in the light of the civil war## s which go on for year## s and make it im## possible to get this financial and material aid to civil## ians , e## special## ly medical and pharmaceutical aid for young child## ren and the elder## ly . 
. if it is absolut## e## ly certain that the aid will not get through , it go## es with## out say## ing that we ask for it to be cut off . 
having s## aid that , I admit that it is extreme## ly difficult be## cause we need real @## -## @ time inform## ation . 
we general## ly get that inform## ation from the oper## ators on the ground , either N## GO## s or international organisation## s , etc . 
that all happen## s in extreme## ly trick## y and extreme## ly sensitiv## e circum## stance## s . 
we there## fore have to carry out a proper ana## lysis be## fore cut## ting off human## itarian aid or s## topp## ing s## end## ing or try## ing to s## end it . 
you mention Côte d &apos;## Ivoire . 
we also have to avoid throw## ing the population in## to dis## arra## y and total desti## t## ution if human## itarian aid is cut off . 
obvi## ously , e## ach case is assess## ed individual## ly on the bas## is of inform## ation from our own delegation## s . 
I have to say that the high level of de## central## isation we have today help## s a lot . 
inform## ation reach## es us more reli## ably and more quick## ly , and on the bas## is of that inform## ation we can either continu## e our work , negotiate to try and get the aid where it is need## ed , or quit## e simpl## y break it off . 
but I could not give my back## ing to any action that di## d not take all these thing## s in## to account . 
I n## ever## the## less repeat that all this is extreme## ly difficult , extreme## ly delicate and extreme## ly fr## agile and , we there## fore have to look at e## ach case individual## ly every time . 
. Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , in all field## s of activity the Commission is const## ant## ly step## ping up protection for the European Union &apos;## s financial interest## s , e## special## ly the prevent## ion of fraud . 
development aid is no except## ion , and it should be not## ed that the Court of Audit## ors ha## s give## n a posit## ive statement of assurance concern## ing the manage## ment of the European Develop## ment Fund for 20## 03 . 
as the Court of Audit## ors and OLAF have confirm## ed , the risk## s relate not to the regular## ity of the transact## ions manage## d by the delegation &apos;## s service## s but ver## y often to the transact## ions manage## d by the implement## ing age## ncies , be the## y local associ## ations in the develop## ing countries , non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s or project manage## ment structure## s . 
that is why , in 20## 03 , the Commission adopt## ed a much more rigor## ous approach involv## ing procedural simpl## ification and external audit , s## o that s## uch transact## ions can be monitor## ed better . 
s## o far as the part play## ed by national interest## s in development aid is concern## ed , tender## ing procedure## s are the best guarantee of trans## par## ency and competit## ion , and there## fore also of reason## able price## s . 
more## over , the European Union &apos;## s development policy is define## d by the Council and Commission joint decla## ration of N## ov## ember 20## 00 and by partner## ship agree## ments with different region## s and countries , s## uch as the Cotonou Agreement , and , final## ly , by international commit## ments like the M## ill## ennium De## clar## ation or the Mont## er## re## y Con## sensus , for ex## ample . 
that is the frame## work for the European Union &apos;## s development policy , and there is no question of any Member State &apos;## s specific national interest## s . 
on the contr## ary , that is the compar## ative advantage of a development policy conduct## ed by the Comm## un## ity : it represent## s European value## s , principle## s and object## ive## s , it is perceiv## ed by our partner## s to be neutral with respect to national poli## cies and it is bas## ed on a genuine con## cept of partner## ship with th## ose countries which is genuine## ly implement## ed . 
Madam President , Commission## er , I should like to have practical propos## al## s for measure## s . 
re## cent## ly , OLAF reveal## ed that economic aid for Les## ot## ho di## d not get through and that the resource## s we## re thu## s not us## ed for the purpose intend## ed . 
I want to hear more practical propos## al## s from the Commission## er . 
. Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , forgiv## e me , but it seem## s to me that the mechan## ism## s be## ing us## ed at the moment are sufficient . 
the proof is that you refer to a case that was in fact br## ought to our notice by our delegation . 
I think , there## fore , that all the necess## ary procedure## s we## re set in motion im## mediate## ly ; complain## ts we## re lodg## ed , etc . 
the whole mechan## ism respond## ed as it should . 
of course , every## thing possible should be done to prevent fraud . 
but every## thing must also be done to prevent our entire system grind## ing to a halt in the process . 
I think the control## s we have today are adequate and the financial rule## s are sufficient## ly precise and restrict## ive . 
I do not question them . 
obvi## ously we are in favour , I am in favour , of zero tolerance , but , if you will forgiv## e me , there is , on the other hand , no s## uch thing as zero risk . 
n## either can we keep on increas## ing the number of control## s , evalu## ations and audit## s over and over again , on## ly to find in the end that no more project## s are be## ing implement## ed . 
bo## th human## itarian and development emerge## ncies arise . 
you ask me for concrete measure## s , but you know what measure## s are deploy## ed and , on the bas## is of the inform## ation I have , I am not in favour of creat## ing additional measure## s . 
the OLAF mechan## ism is complete## ly in## dependent and work## s well . 
our delegation## s on the ground s## end back extreme## ly import## ant inform## ation , and even if we on## ly have mer## e rumour## s , a rapid alert mechan## ism is put in place im## mediate## ly . 
I think it would be difficult to do more . 
what we could s## till do , if you want a concrete measure , would be to keep our delegation## s well inform## ed and to train them well , s## o that the## y are able to respond ver## y quick## ly , be on const## ant alert and make the most of any inform## ation the## y may receiv## e . 
there you are ; I am of course will## ing to discuss the matter and to revise my opinion , but I think there are al## read## y en## ough control## s , e## special## ly s## o far as my port## folio is concern## ed . 
all these control## s , evalu## ations , audit## s and obstacle course## s seem to me to be amp## ly sufficient and I am there## fore ra## ther reluctant to invent any## thing else . 
. 
Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , in political term## s the year 20## 03 in Mauritania was mark## ed by two major even## ts . 
the first was an attempt## ed on 8 and 9 Ju## ne , and the second was the p## resident## ial elect## ion of 7 N## ov## ember , which saw the re @## -## @ elect## ion of the incumb## ent President Ma## a## ou## ya O## ul## d Sid &apos;## Ahmed Ta## ya , who ha## s be## en in power since 19## 84 . 
this la## test p## resident## ial elect## ion was precede## d and follow## ed by arrest## s , most prob## ably some## what arbit## rary , of lead## ing political figure## s . 
give## n the restrict## ions on the exerc## ise of civil lib## er## ties in the con## text of the war on terrorism , and the measure## s take## n in the after## math of the attempt## ed , 20## 03 may be regard## ed as a year of regress## ion on the demo## cracy front . 
the deterior## ation does not seem to have gather## ed pace in 20## 04 . 
n## ever## the## less , Mauritania remain## s a country where dia## logue is possible a## mong the vari## ous component## s of the power structure , even if that dia## logue is in## vari## ably fraught with tension . 
the Commission is aware of the fr## agility of this situ## ation . 
this is why , in the n## in## th European Develop## ment Fund , an amount of EUR ten million , or in other word## s 10 % of the total appropri## ation , was allocate## d to the task## s of strength## ening capacities and establish## ing the rule of law . 
the Commission consider## s it essential , of course , to remain vigil## ant . 
it seem## s to me , how## ever , that the set## back in the democrat## isation process does not y## et warrant a vigorous initiative to secure a negotiate## d solution to the Mauritania## n cris## is . 
let me add that the Mauritania## n Govern## ment was inform## ed that it## s al## location under the n## in## th ED## F was to be reduce## d by EUR ten million , chief## ly to take account of in## adequate sector## al perform## ance in th## ose ver## y area## s of strength## ening capacities and establish## ing the rule of law , as ident## ified in 20## 04 &quot; s mid @## -## @ term review . 
al## though the reduction in fund## ing ha## s more to do with absorpt## ion capacity th## an with the political situ## ation , it should signal to the Mauritania## n author## ities how imperative it is to bolster the rule of law . 
in any case , the European Union is conduct## ing an intens## ified political dia## logue with the Mauritania## n author## ities , and is keeping a ver## y close eye on development## s . 
more## over , I s## hall be making personal contact with the President &apos;## s office and with a number of our connect## ions in Mauritania to discuss the situ## ation . 
the prim## ary purpose of this dia## logue is to promot## e good political and economic govern## ance . 
to this end , it seek## s to support the pur## suit of the democrat## isation process that beg## an with the elect## ions in 20## 01 by high## light## ing the need to respect the rule of law and it## s instrument## s . 
to s## um up my re## ply to your question , I do not think there are sufficient ground## s for embark## ing in the im## mediate futur## e on a vigorous initiative design## ed to secure a negotiate## d solution to the cris## is in Mauritania . 
this does not appear to be just## ified at the present time . 
thank you , Commission## er , for your re## ply , which show## s that you recognis## e how the situ## ation deterior## ated in 20## 03 and acknowledg## e that Mauritania ha## s in## de## ed be## en in cris## is . 
it is tru## e that few people know much about Mauritania . 
in## de## ed , it is vi## rtual## ly a for## gotten country . 
we are not too s## ure whet## her it will be part of the Cotonou Agreement## s with the AC## P countries , or whet## her it will enter in## to the Euro @## -## @ Medi## terranean frame## work . 
ultimate## ly , now that the European Union is one of Mauritania &apos;## s main don## ors , we should like to know whet## her the country will depend on AC## P fund## ing or on the new delegation that ha## s be## en creat## ed . 
on the same subject , may I ask you to provid## e for close## r monitor## ing . 
in fact , in the light of current even## ts , and if we focus on## ly on what ha## s be## en allocate## d to Mauritania in the fisher## ies sector , we must conclude that proper monitor## ing and control are desir## able and that we ought to be able to ensu## re that this control is exerc## ised . 
. I natural## ly share your concern . 
the problem that exist## ed in 20## 03 ha## s certain## ly not become any more acute in 20## 04 . 
I can on## ly promise to ensu## re that the political dia## logue with the author## ities will be quick## ly re## launch## ed , and that it will focus on the concern## s which you have clear## ly express## ed and which I share . 
in the coming week## s , at the begin## ning of the new year , I s## hall establish more regular contact with the author## ities - whom I know well , incident## ally . 
in## de## ed , in my pre## vi## ous life as a Fo## reign Minister , I visit## ed Mauritania and was s## truck by the fact that , al## though the major## ity of it## s population are Mus## lim## s , Mauritania is one of the on## ly Mus## lim countries that maintain## s relation## s with Israel and there## fore tries to be even @## -## @ hand## ed . 
I admir## ed Mauritania for that , be## cause the ability of a Mus## lim country to adopt an even @## -## @ hand## ed approach to a conflict s## uch as that in the Middle East seem## ed to me to indic## ate intellig## ence and a desir## e to avoid ex## posing the country &apos;## s political life to fundamental## ism or excess## es of any kind . 
for this reason , I do not think I s## hall have any difficult## y in re## launch## ing this political dia## logue . 
you can certain## ly count on me to re## launch it at the start of the new year . 
thank you , Commission## er . 
question## s 48 to 87 will be answer## ed in writing . 
the debate will now resum## e , with a continu## ation of the discuss## ion on the prepar## ation of the next Fina## ncial Perspective . 
Mr Sil## va Pen## ed## a ha## s the floor for two minute## s . 
Mr President , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , a seven @## -## @ year period is a long time in the world in which we live . 
since the last Fina## ncial Perspective## s , the EU ha## s under## take## n the big## gest enlarge## ment in it## s histo## ry and ha## s become even more integrate## d with the ent## ry in## to force of the Treat## y of N## ice and the sign## ing of the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
in the last seven year## s , the world ha## s become more global## ised and soci## e## ties have become more complex and divers## ified . 
att## itude## s , custom## s , behaviour and even value## s have change## d . 
the Fina## ncial Perspective## s must there## fore be adapt## able to the current political con## text and to the new real## ities of the world in which we live . 
with the decision on the Fina## ncial Perspective## s , we have a un## ique opportun## ity to show that we have a more ambitious vision for Europe , a win## ning vision , which I think is share## d by the Commission . 
we must there## fore prevent , at all cost## s , any lower## ing of the object## ive## s of the Fina## ncial Perspective## s or any simpl## e act of budget## ary con## solid## ation , which some people would appear to want . 
in this con## text , I should like to ask Mr## s Grybauskaitė kind## ly to comment on the three essential pre## requisite## s on which , to my mind , the Fina## ncial Perspective## s ought to be bas## ed . 
the first of these is cred## ibility . 
the political priorit## ies of step## ping up the competitive## ness of bo## th the econom## y and European cohes## ion must go hand in hand . 
second## ly , there must be a clear break from pre## vi## ous practice## s , by which I mean we need to set about reform## ing the EU &apos;## s own resource## s . 
t## hirdly , imagin## ative solution## s must be creat## ed , s## uch as ens## uring that fund## s earmark## ed in the EU &apos;## s budget## s also act as a tool for mobil## ising other financial sector resource## s , be the## y from the public or privat## e sector . 
Mr President , the new financial frame## work will be the first follow## ing EU enlarge## ment . 
it must be possible for it to be adopt## ed by every## one , bo## th new and old Member State## s . 
this also appli## es to states that are quit## e well off . 
in northern Europe , one## rous special conditio## ns app## ly that have not dis## appear## ed . 
it can## not be fair to allow per## man## ent## ly dis## advantage## d area## s , for ex## ample th## ose with cold climate## s and long distance## s , to pay , as it we## re , for the fact that , statistic## ally , the## y appear to be rich . 
there is also an expect## ation that certain project## s not direct## ly link## ed to the EU budget are to be turn## ed in## to a re## ality . 
in the Baltic region , for ex## ample , there is universal support for im## prov## ing water qual## ity in the Baltic . 
this mean## s , a## mong other thing## s , that it need## s to be possible for all waste water , including that from Saint Peter## s## burg , to be clean## ed . 
the research priorit## ies must support development of whole region## s that have live## d apart for historical reason## s , s## uch as the Baltic region and C## ent## ral Europe . 
final## ly , I would state that there are high expect## ations of great## er clar## ity in the EU &apos;## s foreign policy . 
we face challenge## s in Ukraine , Cau## cas## us , Belarus and per## hap## s also Russia . 
Mr President , I would like to return to this afternoon &apos;## s debate . 
it is a great p## ity that the Council is not present now to listen to our debate on the problem## s we face with the Fina## ncial Perspective , for , s## peak## ing as a regional politic## ian - and as one who work## s in this House &apos;## s Committee on Region## al Develop## ment - it is clear to me that we need the securit## y to plan a## head . 
that mean## s that we need agree## ment , and need it ver## y s## oon , as 20## 05 is the final dead## line if the plan## ning s## tage is not to prove in## sufficient for the local author## ities . 
what that also mean## s is that the los## s is borne by the local s## take## holder## s who want to get involve## d in plan## ning , be## cause the plan## ning rule## s will be implement## ed at this level far too late . 
I also endorse what the Commission## er s## aid about it making sense , in this first year with ten new Member State## s , to extend the period to seven year## s , in order to have a long plan## ning s## tage where the Struct## ural Fund## s are concern## ed . 
that make## s sense in practical term## s . 
I also want to stress that the Struct## ural Fund## s must not be turn## ed in## to a piggy bank , for cohes## ion is at the heart of the European Union . 
in the country I know best , this throw## s up contradict## ions when politic## ians appeal to the mass## es with speech## es about the 1 % issue , on## ly th## en to go to Bru## ssels and ask for money to sort out the structural problem## s in the## ir region . 
we want a tru## ly European policy , and that is not it ! 
Mr President , on the futur## e of European Parliament fund## ing and financ## ing , I accept that it is ver## y import## ant that the Commission and the Council of Minister## s , and in## de## ed Parliament , try after the first seven year## s to think about rational## ising d## uring the f## ive year## s of Parliament &apos;## s term . 
we have the advantage of a fix## ed term , we ought to use that for futur## e financial perspective period## s . 
I ver## y much agree## d this afternoon with Mr van den Berg when he s## aid that we must do some## thing in the nation @## -## @ states to tighten up on account## ability . 
that lead## s me on to our philosoph## y in the Brit## ish Con## serv## ative group , which is that we should try to do what we can in Europe and do it effective## ly and efficient## ly . 
if that mean## s do## ing less , th## en let us do it better . 
too often we try to increas## e the power## s in Europe and increas## e our cover## age of all sort## s of item## s . 
that does not just cost money , it lead## s to further dilut## ion of concentr## ation , of account## ability , and that is extreme## ly import## ant . 
the other point I wish to ra## ise is about own resource## s . 
we need to consider the method of own resource## s . 
we have a perfect## ly accept## able method that work## s quit## e well and we should not make fundamental change## s to it . 
I would not ever like to see the im## position of a European Union tax , which ha## s be## en thought about for the period from 20## 13 on## ward## s . 
that would be a retro## grade step . 
we need to have a Council of Minister## s that is all @## -## @ power## ful in my book , even s## peak## ing as an MEP . 
basic## ally it pay## s the bill## s , and that is fine by me , provid## ed we can control what we are do## ing and provid## e proper account## ability in futur## e . 
Mr President , this question of the European Union &apos;## s financial frame## work is cruc## ial . 
it is cruc## ial be## cause the European Union must rise to for## mid## able challenge## s : bring## ing the enlarge## ment process to a success## ful conclusion , achiev## ing the aim of cohes## ion , the symbol of our policy of solid## arity , with## out forget## ting the less favour## ed region## s of the old Union of 15 , meet## ing commit## ments under the common agri## cultural policy and Natura 20## 00 and , above all , achiev## ing the Lisbon object## ive## s in the real## m## s of competitive## ness , research , employ## ment , train## ing , environment## al policy and public health while giving due consider## ation to the age## ing of our population . 
this last point ha## s not be## en address## ed this afternoon , even though an age## ing population clear## ly ha## s economic and social implic## ations for our futur## e . 
fac## ed by these challenge## s and by the explosive grow## th in Chi## nes## e competit## ion , how does the Commission intend to position it## self ? 
at a time when the Commission and the Council are prepar## ing to open the gate## s of Europe o## nce again , can we continu## e to operate with a budget that ha## s not develop## ed since the 19## 90## s , even though the European Union ha## s sub## sequent## ly take## n on man## y new Member State## s and be## en accord## ed wide## r power## s under a s## eries of new treat## ies ? 
Mr## s Grybauskaitė , we are not re## assure## d . 
question## s need to be ask## ed about the Commission &apos;## s desir## e to make tang## ible propos## al## s . 
arm your## self with the support of Parliament and do what you can to influence the one @## -## @ per @## -## @ cent## ers , to bring home to them , as Mr Barros## o s## aid , that more Europe can## not be achiev## ed with## out more money . 
even allow## ing for the agree## ment on the CAP , we al## read## y know that it will be im## possible to fund the Union &apos;## s regional policy between now and 20## 13 if we adhere to the one @## -## @ per @## -## @ cent ceil## ing . 
Europe is on the move ; it ha## s be## en enlarge## d , it is ambitious , but are you s## ure , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , that you have the mean## s to ful## fil it## s ambit## ion ? 
what we are ask## ing you to do is tell us what resource## s are need## ed to finance our object## ive## s . 
and you know that the## y will have to be increas## ed . 
be prepar## ed , Commission## er , to defend the key position## s vigorous## ly . 
you must be aware that this would be a bad time to disappoint not on## ly Parliament , but all the people of Europe too . 
Mr President , Commission## er , I would like to start what I have to say by plead## ing for great## er serious## ness and a more object## ive approach . 
in our debate this morning on the 20## 05 Budget , a ver## y large number of speaker## s appeal## ed to the Council to take the Budget more serious## ly . 
if , though , we aim to achiev## e an agree## ment with the Council at a time when we are al## read## y talk## ing in term## s of a motion on Budget short## fall , th## en the figure## s we have agree## d are not cred## ible , and man## y al## read## y suspect that we may well not be able to manage on them . 
read## ing the media over the past few days on the subject of the Fina## ncial Perspective , I begin to fear the same thing . 
I also fear a similar lack of serious## ness when it come## s to the debate on Tur## key and other current issue## s , and I ask you , Commission## er , not to be a spec## tator , but to be more political## ly pro @## -## @ active . 
the Budget and the Fina## ncial Perspective are work programme## s in the form of figure## s , and today we have start## ed to discuss the policy programme for the next f## ive year## s . 
what we demand is great## er competitive## ness ; Lisbon and Bar## celona are the top priorit## ies and must be implement## ed just as much as an enhance## d role in the world for young people , the fight again## st terrorism , enlarge## ment through the add## ition of Croatia , Bulgaria and Roman## ia , a new neighbour## hood policy and improve## d inform## ation and communic## ations poli## cies . 
what I would like you to tell us is whet## her all the thing## s we have be## en deba## ting today with regard to additional respons## ibil## ities and measure## s are actual## ly contain## ed in the old Commission &apos;## s propos## al , or whet## her the new Commission ha## s to put it## s stamp upon it and demand political project## s ? 
up to now , it ha## s on## ly be## en whisper## ed be## hind the scene## s that there are const## ant discuss## ions about the upper limit . 
let us put a stop to play## ing game## s with number## s and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost , and th## en we will be able to talk about own resource## s and the al## location of task## s and about who ha## s to do what . 
- Mr President , I should like to make three comment## s on the issue which we are deba## ting . 
first , I welcome the fact that near## ly all the honour## able Member## s who have spoken consider## ed that the European Union budget should be comm## ensu## rate with the ambit## ions table## d from time to time by bo## th the Commission and Parliament , be## cause it is a fact that policy with## out money is not possible . 
what I find particular## ly negat## ive is the fact that the s## ize of the budget is be## ing discuss## ed and there are tend## encies to make cut## back## s at a time when , even if the Commission propos## al we## re accept## ed , this would be the equi## valent of the European Union &apos;## s spend## ing a total of 2.5 % of all annual public expend## iture in Europe , be## cause that is what we are talk## ing about at a time when we have ambit## ions , as I s## aid , for import## ant and serious thing## s . 
second## ly , I should like a clar## ification on the part of the Commission## er as to what is going to happen in connect## ion with the futur## e of the Struct## ural Fund## s if no decision is take## n by the end of this year , be## cause there is a multi## annual aspect to Struct## ural Fund poli## cies , there is the problem of creat## ing what may be a legal lacuna , which will prevent the programme## s from start## ing on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
how could this be address## ed , Commission## er ? 
the thir## d issue on which I wish to comment concern## s the cost of enlarge## ment , give## n that enlarge## ment come## s at a price which we have to pay , be## cause it is a major histo## ric cho## ice of the European Union ; on the other hand , how## ever , this price need## s to be distribut## ed fair## ly . 
I know that , from a technical point of view , this issue does not come under the issue we are discuss## ing now , but it is tangent## ial to the general issue and I should like the Commission## er to tell me if the Commission ha## s at it## s dispos## al stu## dies which show how the cost of enlarge## ment will ultimate## ly be distribut## ed . 
I refer to the question of own resource## s , Commission## er , but I think that these issue## s are direct## ly connect## ed . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , work on the new Fina## ncial Perspective is be## ing under## take## n in ver## y difficult circum## stance## s , and ha## s there## fore give## n rise to much contr## over## s## y . 
not all the issue## s under consider## ation are be## ing discuss## ed . 
this may have be## en the case in the past , but it ha## s come as a surprise to some of the new ent## rant## s to the Union . 
the first point I would like to make is that the propos## al to limit the budget to 1 % is not inspir## ed by the wish to econom## ise , nor does it s## tem from a desir## e to rational## ise expend## iture . 
it is the con## sequenc## e of the plan to change the al## location of financial resource## s and the view that the latter can be utilise## d more effective## ly in national poli## cies . 
what we are there## fore witness## ing is a reduction of the s## cope of Comm## un## ity poli## cies . 
this does not come as a surprise to advoc## ate## s of a co## ordinating Union , but it is cause for alarm a## mong## st advoc## ate## s of a strong Union . 
restrict## ing in## come and expend## iture impact## s direct## ly on all countries , be## cause it require## s change## s to the structure of financ## ing cohes## ion policy and restrict## ing it## s s## cope . 
natural## ly , the weak## est countries are the most affect## ed , when the## y ought to be the main benefic## iaries of this policy . 
my second point is that cohes## ion policy is be## ing re## interpret## ed be## fore our ver## y eye## s . 
this policy is be## coming increas## ing## ly detach## ed from it## s base , name## ly the principle of s## har## ing the problem## s of under @## -## @ development in the spirit of solid## arity , and respond## ing joint## ly also to the pronounce## d in## equal## ities which are the inevit## able con## sequenc## e of economic integration . 
it is there## fore essential to support the ef## fort## s ma## de in the Council of the European Union by th## ose govern## ments radical## ly oppose## d to amend## ment of the relev## ant provision## s and delet## ion of the principle of support## ing the less @## -## @ develop## ed countries . 
an ex## ample from the s## port## ing world come## s to mind . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , imagin## e a situ## ation in which a number of play## ers are recruit## ed to join a football team . 
the## y are eager to play , prepar## ed to under## go a demand## ing train## ing period , and full of fight## ing spirit and the desir## e to win . 
now imagin## e that when the## y make it onto the football pitch the## y are inform## ed that the rule## s have change## d and that the## y will be require## d to play rug## by in## stead . 
I am s## ure you will understand that in s## uch a case the play## ers would be un## pleasant## ly surprise## d and take## n a## back . 
it is to be hop## ed that the Commission## er and the Commission as a whole will act consist## ent## ly to ensu## re that the rule## s remain un## change## d . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , it is in my capacity as a represent## ative of the large## st new Member State , Po## land , that I take the floor in today &apos;## s Que## s## tion Time to the Commission on the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
I am emphasis## ing this as most of the honour## able Member## s who have take## n the floor in this debate hail from the old Fif## teen , and the## ir view## s on the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 are ver## y much at vari## ance with th## ose held by the new Member State## s . 
the first problem I would like to high## light is the s## ize of the budget for the period in question . 
the six s## o @## -## @ call## ed net contribut## ors argue for 1 % of G## DP , where## as the Pro## di Commission propos## ed 1.1## 4 % of G## DP . 
accord## ing to estimate## s , in absolut## e term## s this amount## s to a differ## ence of about EUR 1## 80 billion , which mean## s a## round EUR 25 billion less for e## ach year of this Fina## ncial Perspective . 
this is an enormous s## um from the point of view of the new Member State## s . 
it is a s## um that is absolut## e## ly essential to reduce the differ## ence## s in development between old and new Member State## s , and to ensu## re that the division in## to a first and second class Europe does not become per## man## ent## ly entrench## ed . 
the second problem I should like to refer to concern## s the resource## s for Struct## ural Fund## s and the Cohesion Fund . 
I refer in particular to the## ir al## location to region## s in the old Union affect## ed by the &apos; statistic## al effect . &quot; 
the Commission is show## ing remark## able gener## osity to## ward## s these region## s . there are plan## s to allocate no less th## an EUR 19## 4 billion to them over these next seven year## s , but on## ly EUR 18## 1 billion to region## s in the new Union . 
it should be borne in mind that this period will see the access## ion of at least two new Member State## s , and that the whole of the ter## rit## ory of the 12 new countries is elig## ible for support . 
the thir## d problem I wish to mention concern## s limit## ing resource## s from the Struct## ural Fund## s and the Cohesion Fund to 4 % of the G## DP of the Member State in question . 
for the ten new Member State## s this mean## s an annual total of less th## an EUR 20 billion . 
I believ## e it would be appropriate to ra## ise the thresh## old to at least 5 % of the G## DP of the Member State . 
I ver## y much hope the Commission## er will take the three concern## s I mention## ed in## to account . 
Mr President , let me ra## ise a few issue## s from the perspective of a new Member State . 
first , the new financial frame## work should be d## riven by the political priorit## ies of the enlarge## d Union and the principle of solid## arity a## mong the Member State## s . 
second , the own @## -## @ resource## s ceil## ing should be establish## ed at a level that would assure the success## ful integration of the new Member State## s in the Union and take account of commit## ments enter## ed in## to d## uring the access## ion negoti## ations . 
thir## d , it is my firm belief that we , the European Parliament , have to support high al## location## s for the Lisbon strate## gy measure## s from the Commission &apos;## s budget . 
a clear mechan## ism sec## uring a certain share of fund## s for e## ach Member State should be design## ed for fund## ing this priorit## y . 
I should also like to point out that the fund## ing of the implement## ation of the Lisbon strate## gy object## ive## s should not be at the expense of EU cohes## ion policy . 
the assist## ance planned for the implement## ation of the Lisbon strate## gy object## ive## s should add to , ra## ther th## an replace , the assist## ance under the cohes## ion policy , as competitive## ness and cohes## ion are mutual## ly rein## forc## ing . 
four## th , from the point of view of less @## -## @ develop## ed econom## ies in the EU , the level of financial assist## ance should be proportion## al to countries &apos; current economic level of development . 
in any case the assist## ance rate per capita should not be high## er in the more prosper## ous Member State## s th## an in the less @## -## @ develop## ed one## s . 
fifth , we should also consider that the limit## ation of structural assist## ance through the cap## ping rule , if it is appli## ed in the next program## ming period , could , in some case## s , slow down the social and economic converge## nce of the least @## -## @ develop## ed Member State## s , by direct## ing cohes## ion policy resource## s to more develop## ed Member State## s and region## s . 
last but not least , the Commission right## ly point## ed out that an enlarge## d EU require## s more money . 
it is im## possible to over## come the challenge## s of an enlarge## d and ever @## -## @ enlarg## ing Europe with less money . 
Mr President , it is import## ant that we be give## n the opportun## ity of discuss## ing the financial frame## work in good time and of vot## ing on it in the parliament## ary committee## s at regular inter## val## s . 
that is particular## ly tru## e in the case of cohes## ion policy and regional policy . 
in the past , in fact , regional policy ha## s be## en extreme## ly effective . 
the dis## par## ities in Europe have level## led out to a large ex## tent , and , in the light of new key initiative## s , e## special## ly the Lisbon age## nda , this policy should certain## ly be continu## ed . 
this can on## ly be done , how## ever , if this Parliament , in consult## ation with the Commission and the Council , lay## s down the new regulation## s in good time . 
in concrete term## s , this mean## s that by the middle of next year , mid @## -## @ 20## 05 , we should be able to take a decision on this , fail## ing which we will have a repeat of what happen## ed in 19## 99 when the debate## s we## re too length## y and implement## ation had to be cut short . 
the Lisbon age## nda require## s per## sever## ance on the part of the national govern## ments and of th## ose involve## d in the region## s . 
this mean## s that we must be read## y in time , and , from that point of view , carry## ing the whole thing over to the second half of 20## 06 , under the Brit## ish Presidency , would be detriment## al to the policy . 
in short , I should like to emphasis## e the import## ance of regional policy in the con## text of the Lisbon object## ive## s , innov## ation , promot## ion of competit## ion and the new second budget object## ive , part## ly be## cause this can promot## e co## operation in region## s and co## operation between partner## s . 
let me say , turn## ing to the financial perspective## s , that the 1 % does , of course , make them im## possible . 
an## other factor that play## s a role in this is that we have learn## ed that implement## ation was close## r to the people in a de## centralise## d setting in con## junction with province## s , region## s , c## ities , social partner## s in the region## s in Europe , and great## er involve## ment was the result . 
if 1 % we## re to culminate in a re## national## isation of policy , we would mis## s the European add## ed value , and I would find that ver## y regret## table . 
thank you ver## y much . 
that bring## s us to the end of the list of speaker## s . 
I understand the Commission## er does not intend to take the floor . 
the debate is there## fore closed . 
we feel that the Commission &apos;## s propos## al for the next Fina## ncial Perspective## s is clear## ly not sufficient to address the current social , economic and environment## al challenge## s , the need for economic and social cohes## ion - which ha## s increas## ed with enlarge## ment - and the high level## s of un## employ## ment and p## over## ty in the EU . 
quantitative## ly , what is be## ing propos## ed is actual## ly an average of 1.0## 9 % of Comm## un## ity G## NI , which is less th## an Ag## enda 20## 00 ( 1.1## 0 % ) and pre## vi## ous benchmark## s ; qualitative## ly , the priorit## ies are &apos; competitive## ness , &quot; &apos; entrepreneur## ial spirit &quot; and &apos; securit## y and defence &quot; at the expense of development , co## operation and cohes## ion . 
one might ask in this debate whet## her Barros## o reinforce## s and exacerb## ate## s Pro## di , give## n that statement## s from Commission## ers pave the way to## ward## s negoti## ating , or re## negoti## ating , be## low the al## read## y in## adequate package , in line with the sign## ator## ies of the &apos; Let## ter of the six , &quot; who intend to impose a ceil## ing of 1 % of Comm## un## ity G## NI on the budget , some## thing to which we have al## ways be## en oppose## d . 
we there## fore wish to make it clear that we reject the Fina## ncial Perspective## s , of which the average annual spend## ing fall## s between the Commission &apos;## s propos## al and the ceil## ing of the &apos; Let## ter of the six , &quot; which I mention## ed ear## lier , and is mov## ing ever close## r to that ceil## ing . 
last## ly , we support the idea of retain## ing the seven @## -## @ year financial frame## work , give## n that , even in this area , the tend## ency is to &apos; negotiate &quot; down## ward## s . 
the next item is the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 51 / 20## 04 ) by Mr## s Lamb## ert on be## half of the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s on asy## lum procedure and protection in region## s of origin &#91; 20## 04 / 21## 21 ( IN## I ) &#93; . 
the debate is open . 
Mr## s Lamb## ert ha## s the floor . 
. Mr President , I would like to start by thank## ing all the shadow rapporteur## s and the draft## s## man of the opinion of the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s for the## ir interest and the## ir commit## ment with regard to this report . 
I am s## ure that we would all have like## d more committee time , not least to have debate## d the amend## ments present## ed in committee and the over## all content more thorough## ly , as I am aware that certain difficult## ies s## till remain . 
but there is a great deal on which the major## ity of us from the committee agree and I trust the Council and the Commission will re## member that . 
we welcome the Commission &apos;## s two communic## ations as an import## ant step in the development of a common asy## lum policy . 
we support the stress on measure## s s## uch as the re## settle## ment programme## s , protect## ed ent## ry procedure## s and support in the region as be## ing additional and complement## ary to the exist## ing right## s to seek asy## lum with## in the European Union , and agree that th## ose internal asy## lum system## s should be of high qual## ity . 
we agree that we do not view the out## sourcing of internal EU respons## ibil## ities to camp## s in countries s## uch as Lib## ya as offer## ing any sustain## able solution , or even a short @## -## @ term solution , to th## ose seek## ing asy## lum . 
as regard## s the s## ing## le procedure , we recognis## e that it is better bo## th for the asy## lum appli## cant and the author## ities if all relev## ant inform## ation is examin## ed at one time , and we welcome the fact that the Commission ha## s laid out a common order of decision @## -## @ making . 
how## ever , we also recognis## e the possible protection gap in th## ose Member State## s that on## ly employ full refuge## e status and have no practice of subsid## iary protection , compar## ed with Member State## s us## ing bo## th categor## ies . 
I recognis## e that this is a difficult issue for some Member## s and that paragraph## s 37 and 38 of the report may seem to pre @## -## @ empt the re## consult## ation process on the procedure## s direct## ive in which we hope Parliament will be involve## d ver## y short## ly . 
I would welcome the view## s of Member## s on the possible los## s of th## ose paragraph## s . 
Parliament , how## ever , fully agree## s with the need to front## load the decision @## -## @ making process . 
we support the need for the better use of in @## -## @ country inform## ation by better @## -## @ train## ed staff . 
it is appal## ling that some## one &apos;## s life should depend on an opinion that was n## ever test## ed for it## s ver## a## city . 
this is the situ## ation fac## ing Ram## z## i I## s## al## am , a homo## sexual Algeria## n man who may be deport## ed from the UK to Algeria as he is deem## ed not to be in need of subsid## iary protection . 
this is due to a line in a Canadian diploma## t &apos;## s report some year## s ago , which is s## till include## d in the country inform## ation the UK use## s . 
all the other opinion## s of that diploma## t have be## en delet## ed over time . 
the EU ha## s to do better th## an that in term## s of the qual## ity of the inform## ation we use to decide on people &apos;## s live## s . 
more controversial## ly , the major## ity view in committee was that we need to have in place some form of monitor## ing or report @## -## @ back system on what happen## s to th## ose who are return## ed having ma## de un## success## ful claim## s for protection . 
th## en we might know if it is re## ally safe to return other## s . 
the committee fully support## s the need for a better co## ordinate## d approach to support in the region for the vast major## ity of the world &apos;## s refuge## es who n## ever even try to come to the European Union , contr## ary to man## y news## paper report## s and some politic## ians &apos; view## s . 
we recognis## e that s## uch co## ordination is a challenge , but a piece## meal approach creat## es con## fusion . 
we want to know how the Commission propos## es to improve s## uch co## ordination in futur## e . 
we also agree that we need new money , not a real## location of exist## ing aid budget## s , to offer any long @## -## @ term support to help improve capacity and the qual## ity of respons## e in the region## s of origin in full co## operation with the countries concern## ed . 
what else do we agree on ? 
we agree that re## settle## ment programme## s can be of great value , e## special## ly when the## y cater for th## ose most at risk in an al## read## y precarious situ## ation ; that these programme## s can be us## ed with## in the European Union to help develop a public understand## ing as to why refuge## es seek protection ; and that this understand## ing can help to combat all form## s of discrimin## ation , not least rac## ism and xeno## phobia . 
we also agree that we need a common foreign and securit## y policy that commit## s the EU as a matter of priorit## y to conflict prevent## ion and the re## solution of long @## -## @ term conflict## s . 
in that con## text we welcome the propos## ed EU regional protection programme## s and wish to be involve## d in the## ir development and assess## ment . 
as you can see , there is much that we agree on and that is not in disput## e in this debate . 
what## ever the final vot## e tomor## row , that is the mess## age I would wish us to convey to bo## th the Council and the Commission . 
we agree that the Commission &apos;## s dual approach - to aim for a universal## ly high standard of application of the current direct## ive## s with## in the EU and to improve the conditio## ns for the vast major## ity of refuge## es with## in the region the## y are flee## ing - is a reason## able and in## de## ed ambitious programme . 
Parliament will wish to be fully involve## d in the development of s## uch initiative## s . 
. Mr President , Mr## s Lamb## ert &apos;## s report set## s the two communic## ations in the frame## work of achiev## ing a common European asy## lum system . 
in the asy## lum chap## ter of the Ha## gue Pro## gramme the object## ive of a common European asy## lum system is fully confirm## ed and an ambitious dead## line of 20## 10 is set for the realis## ation of that go## al . 
the Commission will ensu## re that the dead## line is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task . 
as of spring 20## 05 the European Parliament will be a co @## -## @ legisl## ator in the process necess## ary to bring this about . 
the Ha## gue Pro## gramme also reflect## s the fact that the external dimension of asy## lum is be## ing recognis## ed as increas## ing## ly import## ant in the EU . 
the improve## ment of the global protection system is some## thing that can benefit refuge## es the world over and can help to better share out the respons## ibil## ities for refuge## es with th## ose countries that accommo## d## ate the great## er part of the refuge## e population . 
that is also in the EU &apos;## s interest . 
I am grat## e## ful to the rapporteur for recognis## ing the import## ance of this work and the financial implic## ations involve## d . 
the full support of the European Parliament is require## d . 
the dur## able solution## s communic## ation explore## s how the EU can enhance protection capacities in region## s of origin and also help ensu## re more order## ly and manage## d ent## ry in## to the EU of person## s in need of international protection through the setting @## -## @ up of an EU @## -## @ wide re## settle## ment schem## e . 
refuge## es should be able to access protection as quick## ly as possible and as close## ly as possible to the## ir need## s . 
the emphasis here is on burden s## har## ing ra## ther th## an burden shift## ing , on expl## or## ing with thir## d countries how we can work together to address a common challenge . 
these plan## s must be entire## ly complement## ary to , and not a substitute for , Member State## s &apos; oblig## ations under international human right## s law , and in particular the 19## 51 Refugee Convent## ion and the right to asy## lum in the European Union . 
the Ha## gue Pro## gramme is clear that the implement## ation of the second phase of the common European asy## lum system must be bas## ed on a robust evalu## ation of the impact of the measure## s take## n in Member State## s . 
our communic## ation indic## ate## s a method## ology for taking that evalu## ation forward and for how practical co## operation should be develop## ed . 
that collabo## rative and con## sensus @## -## @ d## riven method## ology can also be appli## ed to other area## s under the asy## lum and migration . 
for the long## er term we should encourag## e and promot## e further co## operation a## mong Member State## s in this field . 
that is what the Commission intend## s to do . 
. Mr President , the key to this integrate## d and comprehens## ive approach to asy## lum and migration is the co## operation of thir## d countries , which will be invit## ed to work in partner## ship and share respons## ibility with us to ensu## re that this well thought @## -## @ out policy succeed## s . 
this co## operation should be s## ought through exist## ing instrument## s , including , in particular , the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy . 
the EU must not be seen by thir## d countries as - and here you we## re right , Commission## er - try## ing to shift it## s own respons## ibil## ities from our should## ers to the## ir## s . 
to this end we must demonst## rate , in a visible mann## er , our read## iness to assist these countries in en## h## ancing the## ir protection capacity , to be better prepar## ed to provid## e ur## gent assist## ance to countries in cris## is , and to ensu## re the necess## ary budget## ary mean## s other th## an th## ose al## read## y envi## s## aged as development aid . 
parallel to thir## d countries , we must be seen to be read## y to assume our own respons## ibil## ities : the creation of a common European asy## lum system as call## ed for at Tampere , a fully @## -## @ fledg## ed regional protection programme by Dec## ember 20## 05 , and a re## settle## ment schem## e bas## ed on the absorpt## ion capacity of individual Member State## s . 
final## ly , en## h## ancing protection capacity in creat## ing protect## ed ent## ry procedure## s does not mean abandon## ing the exist## ing right of application for asy## lum on spontane## ous arriv## al in an EU Member State . 
I am firm## ly of the belief that the more the EU succeed## s in en## h## ancing protection capacity in the region## s of origin and the more it assist## s thir## d countries in bring## ing protection capacity up to standard , the more the protect## ed ent## ry procedure## s from out## side the EU will be enhance## d ; the few## er spontane## ous asy## lum claim## s will be present## ed direct## ly to Member State## s ; and the less luc## rative the trade of traffick## ing in human be## ing## s will become . 
. 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , since the Tampere European Council include## d a## mong## st it## s object## ive## s the creation of a common asy## lum system , Parliament - including the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s - ha## s be## en fully commit## ted to that object## ive and to the European Union &apos;## s intention to respond to th## ose people who come to our countries legitimate## ly in search of better live## s and a better futur## e . 
today , and with our sight## s set on 20## 10 , the d## ate establish## ed in the Ha## gue programme for comp## let## ing the second phase of the common asy## lum system , we are fac## ed with the fortunate fact that the European Union ha## s al## read## y adopt## ed import## ant rule## s , but there is s## till a long way to go and we are commit## ted to do## ing s## o . 
our action## s should be character## ised by respons## ibility and rigour . 
when we are talk## ing about human be## ing## s who need our help we can## not act in any other way . 
we are deal## ing with an import## ant report which I believ## e ha## s the fundamental merit of offer## ing a clear and decisive view of certain issue## s : first## ly , Parliament is say## ing a firm &apos; no &quot; to the propos## al to creat## e re## ception camp## s in countries out## side the Union . 
the respons## ibility I s## poke about a moment ago can## not be evad## ed ; we can## not deal with th## ose people look## ing to us to respond to the## ir despair by look## ing the other way . 
keeping asy## lum seeker## s out## side of our border## s is not the best way to demonst## rate the valid## ity of the value## s on which the European Union is bas## ed . 
second## ly , we ask that assist## ance for refuge## es be bas## ed on the principle of solid## arity and a fair distribut## ion of respons## ibility . 
o## nce again , we can see that on## ly solid## arity and joint action by the Union can provid## e vi## able and last## ing solution## s . 
o## nce again , the Union ha## s the opportun## ity to demonst## rate it## s commit## ment to a genuine## ly common asy## lum system . 
final## ly , we express our support for a system of re## settle## ment at Comm## un## ity level , but one which al## ways reconcil## es the will of the State and that of the individual in question . 
for all of these reason## s - al## though right now we have just one difficult## y with the rapporteur - who## s## e ability to reconcil## e position## s we ver## y much appreci## ate and who we thank - on## ly if the problem separat## ing us , with regard to s## o @## -## @ call## ed safe thir## d countries , is resolv## ed , will we be able to vot## e in favour of this report . 
Mr President , my Group support## s this report whole## hearted## ly be## cause we believ## e that a common asy## lum procedure is some## thing that man## y a## cross this House talk about , but the re## ality of actual## ly making it happen require## s support of the Lamb## ert report . 
it is difficult to go from the position of say## ing that we want burden s## har## ing , a common asy## lum policy and to support the Tampere age## nda , to the practical application of that in a report which move## s forward some of the thing## s that we want to see . 
as some## one who deal## t with asy## lum case## s for man## y year## s , I see the Lamb## ert report as a progress## ive report , but one which can be support## ed a## cross this House . 
we talk about good asy## lum decision## s . 
it is a problem in every Member State that asy## lum decision @## -## @ making is s## o poor that we are not serv## ed well in term## s of allow## ing genuine asy## lum seeker## s to make a case and actual## ly enter a country . 
that is bad for all of us . 
poor asy## lum decision @## -## @ making is address## ed in this report . 
we want to step up protection capacity in region## s of origin and we are defi## ning in this report the differ## ence between transit camp## s and out## sourcing our respons## ibil## ities to thir## d countries , and regional protection . 
I want to register our support for this report . 
. 
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank Mr## s Lamb## ert for her report . 
I agree with Mr Mora## es . 
my Group fully support## s the report . 
most of what I would like to say ha## s al## read## y be## en mention## ed by Mr## s Lamb## ert in an excel## lent way . 
how## ever , I should like to point out that there are tension## s between the two direct## ive## s . 
the Qual## ification## s Direct## ive set## s standard## s for refuge## e status and subsid## iary protection . 
there is a need for the direct## ive on mini## mum standard## s on procedure## s to be adopt## ed to come in## to line with the other direct## ive . 
that is not the case at the moment . 
second , the issue of re## settle## ment should be support## ed be## cause it is aim## ed at the most vulner## able . 
it is not an## other path of economic migration . 
it give## s hope . 
at the moment on## ly six Member State## s take advantage of the possibil## ity to take refuge## es under re## settle## ment schem## es , but voluntary deal## s with the refuge## es will help bo## th them and the UN## HCR , which warm## ly support## s re## settle## ment . 
final## ly , we should be clear that re## settle## ment and protect## ed ent## ry procedure## s are not an excus## e for cut## ting back on the right## s of asy## lum @## -## @ seeker## s arriv## ing spontane## ously in the European Union Member State## s . 
. 
Mr President , over these past few year## s , thousand## s of people - men , women and child## ren - have pass## ed through my home town of Ca## lais , or through the notorious San## ga## tte camp , having be## en persuade## d that the## y will find the## ir El D## orado in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom : Kosova## rs , Afghan## s , Iraq## is , Sudan## ese , Kurd## s - people in search of free## dom and securit## y , simpl## e citizen## s of the world , d## riven by mis## ery to take to the road , wish## ing on## ly , like every one of us , for a bit of happi## ness . 
allow me to assure them of our solid## arity . 
European## s must know that there is a better standard of liv## ing here th## an in Africa and , in particular , that it is possible for people to work here illegal## ly if the## y are prepar## ed to earn less and keep quiet . 
in Europe , there are th## ose who attract , exploit and get rich by eng## aging in this slav## e trade . 
y## es , we need to restore the honour of Europe , which is all too often sul## li## ed , just as we must urge the Union to stop bury## ing it## s head in the sand on the pre## text that talk## ing about im## migration fuel## s national## ist sentiment## s . 
Europe , how## ever , must not be the s## ole focus of our attention in this respect . the IM## F , who## s## e re## commend## ations are often respons## ible for mass e## migration## s , the Unit## ed Nation## s and the office of it## s High Commission## er for Refugee## s also have a part to play . 
y## es , the European Union should have an asy## lum policy that accord## s with the principle## s of the European Human Right## s Convent## ion . 
y## es , the European Union should examin## e the e## migration issue in depth . 
y## es , the European Union should re## member that some of the child## ren with## in it## s own ter## rit## ory are s## trick## en by hung## er too . 
. 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , this report express## es in apo## dic## tic term## s a re## jection in advance of any question of setting up the s## o @## -## @ call## ed re## ception centre## s in countries of final transit propos## ed by sever## al part## ies . 
it is s## aid that setting up s## uch centre## s would lead to difficult## ies in comp## ly## ing with international human right## s oblig## ations , but I do not know on what assumption## s this statement is bas## ed . 
I wonder whet## her the rapporteur ha## s al## read## y ascertain## ed that the leader## s of s## uch countries or the N## GO## s , including the European one## s , oper## ating in the countries of origin and transit of im## migrants are not will## ing to co## operate . 
I think that this pre## conception is bas## ed s## ole## ly on ideo## logical ground## s , since re## ception centre## s could certain## ly play an import## ant role in meet## ing bo## th the need to carry out the necess## ary control## s and that of human## e treat## ment of migrants . 
in fact , the refusal to creat## e s## uch centre## s leave## s the situ## ation un## change## d , and hinder## s the welcome involve## ment of countries of transit in the manage## ment of the migration process . 
the centre that was re## cent## ly set up in Africa , thank## s to import## ant intervention by my country through the Tri## poli agree## ments , ha## s al## read## y manage## d to prevent , at least s## o far , the Medi## terranean cross## ing## s by despe## rate people in the traffick## ers &quot; old tub## s and the result## ing tragi## c ship## wreck## s . 
it## s creation ha## s thu## s ma## de it possible to achiev## e a posit## ive out## come in the fight again## st the despi## cable traffick## ing in human be## ing## s . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , asy## lum is not a technical issue . 
it need## s to be recognis## ed for what it is , name## ly a political and social issue . 
for the past few deca## de## s , the Member State## s of the European Union have give## n li## ttle thought to asy## lum policy , particular## ly regard## ing individual## s from other continent## s . 
the disastrous con## sequenc## es of this approach are now evident . 
racist and political extremis## m ha## s become rife , affect## ing bo## th newcomer## s and local people . 
in add## ition , this in## appropriate asy## lum policy ha## s weaken## ed the con## fidence of man## y soci## e## ties in European integration . 
right## ly or wrong## ly , this integration is link## ed to an excess## ive## ly liberal policy on asy## lum . 
clear## ly , s## uch a state of affair## s can## not be allow## ed to continu## e . 
the right balance must be maintain## ed between human right## s , demo## cracy and the safety of citizen . 
I am pleas## ed to note that in the second point of it## s re## solution , the European Parliament emphasis## es the need for &apos; measure## s to step up protection capacity in the region## s of origin &#91; of potent## ial asy## lum seeker## s &#93; . &quot; 
this is entire## ly appropriate . 
in conclusion , Mr President , I should like to emphasis## e that the problem of asy## lum is bound to increas## e , give## n the relativ## e wealth of Europe . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , as Member## s of the European Parliament we s## it in this Chamber represent## ing the citizen## s of the 25 nation## s that make up the European Union . 
in the Union this Parliament is the on## ly institution elect## ed by universal suff## rage . 
in s## o far as we are the vehicle## s for direct con## sensus and have a mandate from the people , for certain issue## s we must succeed in cast## ing off the political ide## ologies to which we subscrib## e . 
im## migration ought to be one of these issue## s . 
histo## ry teach## es us that the great## est mis## fortune for human be## ing## s is to be uproot## ed from the## ir place of origin , and that im## migration arise## s for count## less reason## s , not all of them voluntary . 
a develop## ed social system - and the European Union is a collect## ion of develop## ed states - can## not rule out some aspect## s of this phenomenon and focus s## ole## ly on the emot## ive part . 
the Union must safeguard the fundamental principle## s on which it## s exist## ence is bas## ed , but it must do s## o in a way that benefit## s every## one , bo## th it## s own citizen## s and th## ose of thir## d countries . 
it must do s## o through a common policy , with cho## ice## s that are mutual## ly agree## d upon and maintain## ed , and not by mean## s of in## effective initiative## s which isolate certain Member State## s . 
if there must be a s## ing## le im## migration policy , th## en all it## s con## sequenc## es must be accept## ed , above all at time## s like these when there are deep concern## s regard## ing internal securit## y . 
a## mong other thing## s , it is import## ant not to rule out the organisation of an im## migration inform## ation and prepar## ation system in countries of origin and transit . 
s## uch a system should be organise## d and mutual## ly agree## d on and , if add## ed to economic aid and incentiv## es in the area## s of origin , could provid## e posit## ive result## s for all . 
this propos## al does not take this approach to the issue , not even in practical term## s , and that is why we can## not support it un## less appropriate amend## ments are adopt## ed . 
Mr President , I must begin by thank## ing our rapporteur , Mr## s Lamb## ert , for this excel## lent report , which ha## s our support . 
we have , in fact , reach## ed a critical juncture in the formula## tion of a European asy## lum policy . 
it is observ## able that the first phase of European harmon## isation of national asy## lum poli## cies ha## s result## ed in a level## ling @## -## @ down of standard## s . 
in N## ov## ember of this year , the Council adopt## ed a new set of priorit## ies for a European asy## lum policy in the Ha## gue Pro## gramme . 
a## mong the provision## s of this programme for the second phase of harmon## isation is the development of a common asy## lum procedure , and our main mess## age here is that Europe is a place of refuge and that we must pre## serve that human## itarian tradition . 
in this con## text , the fore## most aim of the report be## fore us is to remind the Member State## s that the Gene## va Convent## ion and the role of the High Commission## er for Refugee## s must remain at the heart of our asy## lum policy . 
in order to pre## serve Europe &apos;## s human## itarian tradition , we formal## ly re## affirm our op## position to any move## s to out## source the application process and to creat## e transit camp## s beyond the front## iers of the European Union . 
European asy## lum policy must be bas## ed on the principle of solid## arity , of share## d burden## s and respons## ibil## ities , not on## ly in## side the European Union but also with non @## -## @ EU countries . 
a European asy## lum policy must also reinforce the fundamental right## s of asy## lum seeker## s . 
the prim## ary aim of the s## ing## le asy## lum procedure must be to guarantee a high level of protection for refuge## es . 
it must also provid## e s## cope for improve## d decision @## -## @ making . 
the European Parliament , democratic## ally elect## ed and account## able to the people## s of Europe , must affirm the right of asy## lum seeker## s to a dign## ified re## ception . 
we want more access## ible , fair## er and better organise## d asy## lum system## s , and we must rect## ify the defect## s in the present system## s . 
we must protect refuge## es , and we must also work on our own population## s , explain## ing to them the distress that drive## s people to seek refuge in Europe and , by this mean## s , foster## ing a better understand## ing of the situ## ation . 
it is , of course , desir## able that refuge## es return to the## ir own countries . 
to that end , it will be necess## ary to deal with the under## ly## ing cause## s of the## ir p## light . 
in the mean## time , how## ever , it is our du## ty to focus on the local integration of refuge## es and on the## ir accommo## d## ation in host countries while upgrad## ing protection cap## abilities and develop## ing a programme for the development and adopt## ion of sustain## able solution## s . 
last## ly , there seem## s to be a problem with the interpret## ation of Amendment No 1 in sever## al language## s . 
let me there## fore make it clear that the word &apos; bas## ed &quot; refer## s to the pre## mature repatri## ation of refuge## es , not to the safeguard## s design## ed to strength## en the protection programme## s . 
I felt it was import## ant to clar## ify that point . 
Mr President , I concur with the man## y warm word## s that have be## en spoken by a number of Member## s , and I too would ask for your support for this excel## lent report . 
we are fac## ed with a ver## y har## row## ing problem for which a solution is require## d as a matter of urge## ncy . 
that solution should , how## ever , be a real and per## man## ent one ra## ther th## an a make## shift attempt . 
what is re## ally require## d in the long term is , of course , legal im## migration in the European Union ; from that point of view , the Council ha## s mis## s## ed an opportun## ity by de## liberate## ly ex## clud## ing legal im## migration from qualified major## ity vot## ing . 
it would appear that the Member State## s find it easi## er to reach agree## ment on how to keep people out## side of the EU th## an on how we can proper## ly allow them in . 
over the past few week## s and month## s , the EU and Parliament have discuss## ed European value## s and human right## s at great length , particular## ly in the debate on the Commission , but also again today in connect## ion with Tur## key . 
our civil## isation &apos;## s standard## s are measur## ed again## st the mann## er in which we deal with our fellow human be## ing## s and translat## e our value## s in## to practice . 
asy## lum seeker## s are not criminal## s ; the## y are fellow human be## ing## s and should , accord## ing## ly , be receiv## ed under human## e conditio## ns . 
the## y deserve our support , and I , there## fore , endorse this report . 
the world assess## es the European Union &apos;## s commit## ment to equal## ity , justice and fair @## -## @ play by the way it treat## s th## ose flee## ing war and persecut## ion . 
Mr## s Lamb## ert is to be strong## ly commend## ed for her report and for the focus that it give## s to the human## itarian and the civil right## s issue## s which lie at the heart of the asy## lum debate . 
I echo her call for the high## est possible international standard## s and human right## s to guide EU policy . 
her re## jection of the s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; holding centre## s &apos; , even as a short @## -## @ term solution to the issue of deal## ing with asy## lum appli## cant## s , is to be welcome## d and strong## ly endorse## d . 
the emphasis in the report on speed## ing up asy## lum re## quest## s and ens## uring efficiency and trans## par## ency in the decision @## -## @ making process is also welcome . 
conflict , p## over## ty and socio @## -## @ political inst## ability affect million## s of people a## cross the world . 
we there## fore need to shift the emphasis to## ward## s promot## ing conflict re## solution and prevent## ion under the au## spice## s of the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
the long @## -## @ term solution to issue## s of asy## lum is to reduce conflict and p## over## ty global## ly . 
the EU ha## s a major role to play in this regard . we must get the policy right . 
we must demonst## rate to the world that when it come## s to human right## s , justice and equal## ity , the policy implement## ation of the EU is as good as it## s rhetoric . 
I also strong## ly support the amend## ments . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I recognis## e my## self in the Lamb## ert report , be## cause , if there is an ene## my prevent## ing Europe from grow## ing , that ene## my is fear . 
one of the ways of combat## ing it is certain## ly by know## ing how to recognis## e th## ose who deserve help a## mong th## ose who turn to us for assist## ance . 
not long ago , 75 Eritrea## ns we## re arrest## ed by the Lib## yan author## ities ; the## y had to under## go a long period of detention and we## re subject## ed to in## human## e treat## ment . 
the## y we## re th## en put on an aero## plane to be take## n back to the## ir country of origin . 
seize## d by despair , the## y hijack## ed the aero## plane and force## d it to land in Sudan . 
the Unit## ed Nation## s High Commission## er for Refugee## s was able to interview 60 of the 75 Eritrea## ns , since the other## s we## re in prison for the hijack## ing . 
all th## ose interview## ed we## re entitle## d to asy## lum , but Lib## ya does not have a law recognis## ing s## uch a right , is not a sign## atory to the Gene## va Convent## ion and does not guarantee respect of human right## s in prison . 
on the other hand , even countries s## uch as mine - I## ta## ly - do not have a law on the right to asy## lum , and there## fore reject migrants in## discrimin## ate## ly , with## out examin## ing application## s and with## out fair , just and individual assess## ments . 
even legal im## migrants are humili## ated and force## d to wait for year## s for the right## ful renew## al of the## ir reside## nce permit## s . 
it is clear that these person## s are consider## ed an ene## my with## in , to be treat## ed bad## ly and throw## n out . 
Europe it## self , though , should examin## e asy## lum application## s , at the same time help## ing the Mag## hreb countries to progress a## long the path of respect## ing right## s . 
we should ensu## re that Europe , by us## ing the high## est crite## ria for assess## ing and protect## ing refuge## es , transform## s these wave## s of people in## to legal im## migrants , and this plan is bo## th benefic## ial and possible . 
for this reason it is necess## ary to set up a s## ing## le European age## ncy for refuge## es and European re## ception centre## s to examin## e individual re## quest## s , provid## ing legal and linguist## ic assist## ance . 
the refuge## es will be our fore## most al## lies in promot## ing economic , civil and democratic grow## th in the## ir countries of origin , since the world will be more secure on## ly when it stop## s be## ing s## o un## fair . 
thank you ver## y much . 
that conclude## s the list of speaker## s . 
I understand the Commission## er does not wish to take the floor .

the next item is the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 67 / 20## 04 ) by Mr Cata## nia on be## half of the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s , contain## ing a propos## al for a European Parliament re## commend## ation to the Council on the European Union drug## s strate## gy ( 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 12 ) &#91; 20## 04 / 22## 21 ( IN## I ) &#93; . 
I should like to give the floor to Mr Cata## nia , the rapporteur . 
. 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I believ## e that the European Union &apos;## s anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy , which is on the age## nda for debate , ought to operate exclus## ive## ly through a scientific approach , through an ana## lysis of the actual situ## ation and of the experience on this issue built up over re## cent year## s . 
in contrast , un## fortunate## ly , the argument is all too often perme## ated with ide## ologies and dogma## tic or emot## ive approach## es . 
the data avail## able to us allow us to take a practical approach . 
I refer , in particular , to the data sup## plied to us by the European Mon## ito## ring Centre for Drug## s and Drug Addi## ction , bas## ed in Lisbon . 
as is well @## -## @ known , these data are not on## ly of high scientific value but also of prov## en reli## ability . 
all this un## equi## vocal## ly demonst## rates that the strate## gies adopt## ed up to now have not had posit## ive result## s . 
with regard to drug use in prison## s , the Centre indic## ate## s that drug us## ers are over @## -## @ represent## ed in prison ; that the use of drug## s a## mong detain## ees range## s from 22 to 86 % , depend## ing on the prison population , the prison and the country ; and that prison## s are a high @## -## @ risk environment for the spread of infect## ious dis## ease## s . 
with regard to the criminal## isation of drug use , the Centre explain## s that in man## y Member State## s the process of criminal## ising the use of narco## tic## s ha## s led to an increas## e in the use of these sub## stance## s . 
I should point out to my Swe## dish fellow Member## s that the Centre &apos;## s report contain## s a specific reference to the situ## ation in Swede## n , where a stu## dy is cite## d which show## s that with the repress## ive strate## gies in force in that country the drug market ha## s intens## ified ; it conclude## s that there is no specific proof for the argument that the criminal## isation of drug use ha## s a deter## rent effect on young people . 
final## ly , with regard to drug traffick## ing , Euro## pol indic## ate## s that narco## tic## s traffick## ing account## s for approximate## ly 2 to 5 % of world G## DP , which go## es direct## ly in## to the hand## s of drug traffick## ers and large criminal organisation## s world## wide . 
the US drug## s age## ncy estimate## s that in 20## 05 Afghan## istan will export over f## ive thousand ton## s of op## ium , of which 95 % will end up in Europe . 
this demonst## rates that the action plan adopt## ed by the UN in 19## 98 ha## s not had posit## ive result## s , and this is also tru## e in term## s of the import## ance of drug## s in fund## ing organise## d crime and terrorism . 
a prominent prosecu## tor , Gerard## o D &apos;## Amb## ro## s## io , ha## s explain## ed to us that to finance the Madrid attack the Al @## -## @ Qu## aid## a terrorist## s barter## ed 2## 50 kilo## gram## s of hash## ish for the TNT . 
our report , which ha## s be## en adopt## ed by the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s , is there## fore bas## ed on the need to fight drug traffick## ing , organise## d crime and terrorism and to give priorit## y to sav## ing live## s and protect## ing health . 
the issue must not be treat## ed as a question of public order or a matter for repress## ion , but exclus## ive## ly as a social and economic issue . 
I there## fore call on the European Parliament to adopt this report , on the Commission to back it and on the Council - which is un## fortunate## ly absent , having clear## ly al## read## y ma## de up it## s mind - to consider including this re## commend## ation on the age## nda for the meet## ing to be held in three days &quot; time . 
I would also like to mention that this re## commend## ation was put together with the support of man## y organisation## s . 
. 
Mr President , Mr Cata## nia , as you know , the new drug## s strate## gy for the period from 20## 05 to 20## 12 that is to be endorse## d by the European Council is the first anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy for the enlarge## d Union . 
it is bas## ed on an assess## ment of the pre## vi## ous strate## gy , which the Commission car## ried out back in October . 
the European approach , which favour## s a balance between demand @## -## @ reduction and supply @## -## @ reduction measure## s , there## fore cover## s 25 countries . 
this strate## gy clear## ly address## es the need to enhance co## ordination with## in the Union as well as to ra## ise the profile of EU ef## fort## s in other countries . 
the principal aim## s laid down in the strate## gy will be translat## ed in## to specific action## s in the two success## ive four @## -## @ year action plan## s , which , as you are aware , will be propos## ed by the Commission at the start of 20## 05 and the start of 20## 09 respect## ive## ly . 
the Commission intend## s to adopt it## s propos## al for an action plan in Fe## bru## ary 20## 05 . 
it believ## es that Parliament &apos;## s contribut## ion in an area s## uch as the drug## s issue is essential as a mean## s of bring## ing European policy close## r to the people . 
what we need , in other word## s , is a share## d European political strate## gy . 
rest assure## d that the Commission will not falter in it## s commit## ment to this approach . 
. Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I can inform you that the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s can## not lend it## s support to the draft re## commend## ation we are discuss## ing today , be## cause it does not provid## e answer## s to the major challenge## s on which the EU should focus it## s futur## e drug## s strate## gy . 
re## cent figure## s about drug use a## mong young people are alarm## ing . 
an increas## ing number of young people start experiment## ing , and at an ever @## -## @ young## er age , with soft drug## s , in particular , which are ma## de ever more access## ible by the fall## ing price## s for them . 
I believ## e that the rapporteur , in hi## s report , is minimis## ing the problem , and I see this as clear## ly in## appropriate in this situ## ation . 
on the contr## ary , the situ## ation require## s a bold and comprehens## ive approach with on## ly one go## al in mind : that of re## duc## ing the use of drug## s and all the## ir advers## e con## sequenc## es . 
the Commission &apos;## s assess## ment report and the annual report of the European Mon## ito## ring Centre for Drug## s and Drug Addi## ction prove that a great deal is y## et to be done , including at European level . 
the European policy should , as the Commission## er stated , add value to the different## iated approach in the different Member State## s in term## s of co## ordination , inform## ation , scientific research and the tack## ling of the cross @## -## @ border drug## s trade and crime that go## es hand in hand with that . 
we believ## e that , if s## uch a policy is to be adopt## ed , a separat## e budget line should be creat## ed for support## ing new initiative## s and promot## ing the exchange of use## ful experience between the vari## ous Member State## s . 
nothing of the sort is to be found in this report . 
far from it ; it is in## coherent and ridd## led with contradict## ions . 
for ex## ample , it call## s for an approach bas## ed on fact## s and scientific research - some## thing that we can , of course , support - while , in the same breath , draw## ing conclusion## s most of which are in## correct . 
it claim## s that repress## ion ha## s no benefit## s , and that past action ha## s fail## ed to bear any fruit . 
more## over , it jump## s to conclusion## s as to what should be done . 
final## ly , the European Council will be de## termin## ing the strate## gy this week , and Parliament .## .. 
. Mr President , this is an excel## lent report which we on this side of the House support . 
we support it for man## y of the reason## s which the pre## vi## ous speaker mention## ed , including in term## s of the science and pragmat## ic fact## s of this debate . 
we do not take an over## t## ly ideo## logical stance , but there is some ide## ology in the debate and the ide## ology say## s that , un## less we deal with harm reduction , un## less we understand addict## ion and un## less we understand the explosion in crime which lead## s from drug## s to the domestic crime that we suffer in all of our European Union Member State## s , we can## not tackle the problem efficient## ly and effective## ly . 
this report - which was a much amend## ed report with approximate## ly 1## 06 amend## ments in committee - show## s two thing## s . 
one is that there is an active interest in this House in an EU drug## s strate## gy . 
second## ly we all know as MEP## s that there is a ver## y strong public appet## ite for there to be an EU strate## gy . 
s## o what is that strate## gy to be ? 
the answer to that question is ver## y much contain## ed in this report . 
for ex## ample , in this report we talk not about be## ing hard on drug## s or soft on drug## s , but about actual## ly look## ing at intelligent harm @## -## @ reduction strate## gies . 
we know the connect## ions between drug use and H## IV . 
if we ignor## e th## ose in this House , th## en there will be further harm , further crime and further suffer## ing . 
we want to lay much great## er stress on harm reduction , but also on re## habilit## ation . 
we want to provid## e appropriate fund## ing for inform## ation measure## s and not to pretend that the public ha## s sufficient inform## ation about this problem . 
we also want to take appropriate step## s to prevent the profit## s of illegal drug @## -## @ traffick## ing from be## ing us## ed to fund every## thing from international terrorism to other form## s of crime . 
this report is thu## s not &apos; hard &apos; or &apos; soft &apos; . 
it is effective . 
it tackle## s crime , as well as the harm be## ing done to individual## s . 
in this report we also urge govern## ments and national parliament## s to take effective measure## s to prevent drug## s enter## ing prison## s . 
Mr Cata## nia continu## ally stress## ed this point , be## cause it is too often ignor## ed in Member State## s . 
it is for us in the European Union to tackle some of the difficult issue## s a## cross Member State## s which some## time## s individual Member State## s are not emphasis## ing en## ough . 
prison## s are now multi## ply## ing the effect## s of drug harm . 
people are coming out of prison## s and commit## ting more crime . 
this is a serious issue for the European Union . 
there is a strong public appet## ite for us as MEP## s and for the Commission to tackle drug## s with an effective drug## s strate## gy . 
the old style of cliché## s and inform## ation about drug## s ha## s long gone . 
we now need a more effective strate## gy . 
this report place## s the right emphasis on harm reduction , tack## ling addict## ion and deal## ing with the source of drug problem## s , ra## ther th## an expound## ing cliché## s about the effect## s . 
it is a good report which we will support . 
it ha## s be## en much amend## ed and I think that , in the light of th## ose amend## ments , it is a report that the whole House should support . 
we on this side will do s## o . 
. Mr President , if I could cut down the use of drug## s by vot## ing again## st this report , I would do s## o im## mediate## ly , but that , un## fortunate## ly , is not an opt## ion . 
I there## fore call on this House to support this report , for it is an excel## lent and courage## ous one . 
what is it## s object## ive ? 
I think we all share it . 
I have also listen## ed to Mr## s Bre## po## el## s , and we have support## ed a large proportion of her amend## ments . 
the object## ive is harm reduction , limit## ing the damage for the us## er and for the environment . 
we must look in## to the best way of achiev## ing this . 
we must look to see which policy can produce result## s , be## cause the## y are what matter . 
this is not about ide## ology , but about result## s . 
we must adopt policy that is bas## ed on fact , research and exchange of knowledge and experience , ra## ther th## an on ide## ology . 
it is there## fore un## fortunate that the assess## ment of the pre## vi## ous strate## gy was not avail## able on time . 
more## over , it was stated a moment ago that the Council would , in the next few days , be de## cid## ing to adopt this strate## gy after all . 
it would be ver## y regret## table if the Council we## re to do s## o with## out Parliament having had a say in it . 
the report take## s a pragmat## ic , realistic approach , and I have to say , in all honest## y , that I have interpret## ed it in a complete## ly different way from Mr## s Bre## po## el## s . 
I do not think at all that it rule## s out repress## ion as an opt## ion . 
it is , of course , the case - and that also appli## es to Dutch policy , which is wide## ly mis## under## stood - that s## uch repress## ion must be specific and effective . 
look## ing at the tough war on drug## s wage## d by the US## A , I would say that this ha## s done nothing to reduce the use of drug## s , but ha## s on## ly line## d the pocket## s of the drug## s bar## ons . 
cruc## ial to our approach must be prevent## ion and pragmat## ism . 
I will give you a few ex## ample## s that are controversial , even in the N## ether## land## s . 
every## one ha## s difficult## y accept## ing them , and the## y are not decision## s to be take## n light## ly . 
should we , for ex## ample , provid## e need## les to drug us## ers who live on the street## s ? 
are we , by do## ing this , con## don## ing the## ir use of drug## s ? 
no , of course not , but if we provid## e need## les , th## en we know for certain that there are no dirt## y need## les in circul## ation or in use . 
at major house part## ies , where young people take all kind## s of table## ts , including ecst## asy and that sort of thing , should we test the qual## ity of th## ose table## ts ? 
should we provid## e inform## ation ? 
should we ensu## re that th## ose young people do not mix alcohol with drug## s ? 
by do## ing this , do you give them the mess## age that it is okay to use drug## s ? 
that is a risk . 
on the other hand , I can see that , if this is not done , th## en young people di## e at these part## ies . 
as long as the## y s## till use drug## s , which the## y do , I think that prevent## ion and inform## ation are import## ant . 
final## ly , we have table## d two amend## ments about the ex## changing of inform## ation and consider## ation of alter## native method## s . 
. 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , a## cross the world prohibition## ism ha## s al## ways produce## d two result## s : on the one hand , a large increas## e in the number of death## s and imprison## ments a## mong th## ose who use narco## tic## s , who constitut## e the section of the prison population with the high## est re @## -## @ offend## ing rate , and on the other hand un## limit## ed big business for all sort## s of drug traffick## ers . 
this plan , how## ever , focus## es main## ly on protect## ing every## one &apos;## s health . 
this is why the harm reduction strate## gies are absolut## e## ly fundamental . 
on## ly by keeping al## ive person## s who current## ly can## not or do not want to stop us## ing narco## tic sub## stance## s can we hope that in the futur## e the## y will succeed in es## cap## ing from all form## s of depend## ence . 
we must not forget that most death## s are due to AIDS and heart fail## ures , that is , patho## logical situ## ations connect## ed with drug @## -## @ taking method## s . 
for this reason , harm reduction involve## s taking action on the street and at low @## -## @ thresh## old centre## s . 
in add## ition , we must firm## ly distinguish between drug dealer## s and drug us## ers , al## though repress## ive poli## cies tend to place them in the same categor## y . 
final## ly , it is essential to integrate social measure## s and pharmaco## logical substitution measure## s . 
we must avoid any kind of moral## istic att## itude that set## s these in op## position . 
. Mr President , we are today discuss## ing Mr Cata## nia &apos;## s controversial report on the European anti @## -## @ drug strate## gy , central to which is the fight again## st drug## s ra## ther th## an the promot## ion of them . 
judging by the title of the report , we seem to be in agree## ment on this . 
there is no place for drug## s in a health## y soci## ety . 
if we in the European Union are serious about tack## ling the drug trade , we will need to impose sanction## s . 
we can no long## er toler## ate the people who ruin live## s by making money from addict## s . 
how## ever , we might well have a running battle on our hand## s if , contra## ri## wise , we di## d not do every## thing in our power to fight drug use . 
in add## ition to taking prevent## ive measure## s , it must s## till be possible to penal## ise the use of drug## s . 
on be## half of my group , I have there## fore table## d two amend## ments en## ab## ling the continu## ed application of sanction## s in respect of drug off## ence## s , a## long## side prevent## ive measure## s . 
I urge you to support th## ose amend## ments . 
this , of course , does not make it a good report . 
I have to get it off my chest : the report is full of ide## ology , de## spite the fact that it claim## s the opposite . 
I will leave it here . 
thank you for the opportun## ity of s## peak## ing my mind . 
. Mr President , even though I will not be support## ing the report I should like to thank the rapporteur for hi## s work . 
de## spite what he may say about the need to move away from ide## ology , there is an awful lot of ide## ology with## in the report . 
if we have differ## ing opinion## s , it will be hard for us to find the common ground that we should all striv## e for . 
I must say at the out## set that on read## ing the report one would believ## e that the criminal## isation of drug## s and drug use ha## s led to an increas## e in the use of drug## s . 
one would there## fore have to tacit## ly agree that de## criminal## isation would lead to a reduction in and the safe## r use of drug## s . 
the reference## s to &apos; harm reduction &apos; method## s and s## o on are an abuse of the English language . 
it is mer## e## ly facilit## ation . 
de## spite what people may say and de## spite the good intention## s that the## y may have , it is in## correct to say that the death rate from AIDS could be reduce## d through need## le exchange . 
a us## er will al## ways use more need## les and pass them on to other us## ers . 
we have to be realistic when we look at this problem . 
the fact is , first and fore## most , that we are deal## ing with people &apos;## s live## s - and the live## s of people who are in## vari## ably some of the most vulner## able in our soci## ety . 
there are claim## s that we would make the## ir drug use safe## r by supply## ing shoot## ing @## -## @ up kitchen## s , by giving them clean need## les , or by the medical use of hero## in - as stated in the report - and that this would make these people &apos;## s live## s better . 
the re## ality is that addict## ion is hell , addict## ion destroy## s . 
the on## ly way to stop people from be## ing addict## s is by s## topp## ing them from us## ing drug## s . 
the on## ly way to prevent people from re## laps## ing in## to addict## ion is to take away the## ir need for the drug . 
if you dis## believ## e what I say , do not bother look## ing at any of the s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; illegal drug## s &apos; . 
look at the legal drug## s that are avail## able in Europe - alcohol and cigar## ette## s - and see the damage that the## y cause . 
Mr Mora## es s## poke ear## lier about the de## vast## ation that is cause## d on the street## s be## cause of drug @## -## @ relate## d crime . 
look at the de## vast## ation that is cause## d by alcohol - a legal drug - on the street## s of every city in western Europe . 
if we go down the road of legal## isation and harm reduction , as propos## ed in this report , th## en we would see the problem exacerb## ated a hundred## fold a## cross all our c## ities . 
the issue here is not about a mix @## -## @ and @## -## @ match of best poli## cies . 
the issue is about inform## ation to show people the damage and danger## s that the## y face if the## y get involve## d in drug## s . 
the issue is about strong criminal penal## ties to ensu## re that th## ose who traffic in drug## s are hit where it hurt## s : in the## ir pocket## s . 
that require## s asset seizure## s and asset free## z## ing ; a strong policy to ensu## re that th## ose who are addict## s and th## ose who fall in## to drug problem## s are give## n proper resource## s to over## come the## ir addict## ions . 
as some## body who ha## s work## ed with young adult## s who are drug addict## s and alcohol## ic## s , I have seen that the on## ly way that people get off drug## s is when the## y stop . 
that should be the ultimate aim , not facilit## ating drug use . 
Mr President , there are two genuine## ly op## posing view## s in this case : one in which drug## s have be## en accept## ed as a natural part of our every## day life and an## other in which there is a desir## e to do every## thing to stop the sale and con## sumpt## ion of all drug## s . 
most Swede## s , e## special## ly parent## s , are in favour of the latter approach . 
it mean## s that prevent## ion and the fight again## st drug## s under criminal law have the high## est priorit## y . 
to maintain , like Mr Cata## nia , that current drug## s policy could be a crime again## st human right## s is quit## e alien to us . 
we do not see the taking of illegal drug## s as a human right . 
penal## ties that en## able drug addict## s to cho## ose care in## stead of prison are not a crime again## st human right## s . 
the## y are a way of help## ing people escape drug depend## ency . 
the European Mon## ito## ring Centre for Drug## s and Drug Addi## ction in Lisbon also point## s this out at the end of the introdu## ctory summa## ry in it## s report , which I think Mr Cata## nia should read . 
we do not wish to de## criminal## ise drug abuse . 
in## stead , we wish to give clear and un## ambigu## ous signal## s that reject drug## s . 
propos## al## s to have doctor## s offer people help in taking drug## s or , even wor## s## e , propos## al## s to distribut## e hero## in are just as alien to us . 
what is central as far as we are concern## ed is that the re## habilit## ation of drug addict## s and the content of the care give## n to them should be , and remain , a national compete## nce . 
the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s , in common with we Swe## dish Mode## rates , will vot## e again## st Mr Cata## nia &apos;## s report precise## ly be## cause we take a stand in the fight again## st this epidemic . 
our approach is direct## ed to## ward## s re## l## easing people from drug depend## ency , not see## ing them hook## ed on drug## s . 
Mr President , in the six## ties , rebellious and critical young people discover## ed the drug## s that had pre## vi## ously be## en us## ed on## ly be## hind closed door## s by the well @## -## @ heel## ed in soci## ety . 
the## y saw the use of soft drug## s as part of the## ir fight for free## dom . 
since th## en , policy in a number of states ha## s be## en aim## ed at isol## ating , criminal## ising , penal## ising and elimi## nating drug us## ers . 
this repress## ive approach ha## s not prevent## ed the use of drug## s from spread## ing . 
the alter## native to this approach is not to become in## different and con## sequent## ly to resign one## self to the damage which drug## s do to the health of the us## ers and the nuisance the## y cause for other## s , as also do alcohol and nic## otine . 
we should not s## hy away from the conflict with the dealer## s , who make a good liv## ing from other people &apos;## s problem## s . 
in hi## s report , my colleague , Mr Giusto Cata## nia , ha## s show## n the right way to reduce the problem## s as much as possible . 
he endorse## s the practice , develop## ed in the N## ether## land## s , Bel## g## ium , Switzer## land and part## s of Germa## ny , of tolerance , prevent## ion and provision of aid to us## ers and of distinguish## ing between the addict## ive tend## encies of different type## s of drug## s . 
I am aware that this approach meet## s with emotional object## ions a## mong th## ose who labour## ed under the illusion of be## ing able to stamp out drug## s by penal## ising the us## ers , but that ha## s on## ly result## ed in resist## ance to the lack of free## dom . 
that is why broad support is need## ed for the alter## native . 
Mr President , the Swe## dish Ju## ne List is strong## ly critical of the report we are deba## ting today . 
accord## ing to the propos## al , a genuine EU policy to combat drug## s must be introduce## d . 
a common drug## s policy with## in the EU mean## s a compromis## e policy that is liberal regard## ing drug## s . 
in Swede## n , any use of drug## s , except for medical reason## s , is ban## ned . 
for us , it is import## ant for Swede## n &apos;## s restrict## ive drug## s policy to continu## e in the futur## e too . 
we re## commend prevent## ive work , treat## ment , social educ## ation and re## habilit## ation . 
the report emphasis## es a drug## s policy design## ed to reduce harm . 
we want to work to## ward## s a drug## s @## -## @ free soci## ety in## stead of accept## ing the use of drug## s . 
we object to drug## s be## ing class## ified as soft or hard , as well as to the assert## ion that s## o @## -## @ call## ed soft drug## s are not addict## ive . 
the lack of internal border control## s able to prevent the drug## s trade between the Member State## s is a problem in this connect## ion . 
an individual EU Member State must be able to monitor it## s national border## s in order to prevent drug## s from coming in## to the country . 
as matter## s now stand , internal border control## s in the EU are practical## ly non @## -## @ exist## ent . 
in conclusion , I would note that drug problem## s in the EU are in large measure a con## sequenc## e of the prevail## ing p## over## ty in man## y countries in the world . 
not be## ing inform## ed by a sense of solid## arity , EU trade policy involv## ing du## ties , lic## ence## s and quota## s contribut## es to the problem## s of global p## over## ty . 
it is import## ant for the UN , ra## ther th## an the EU , to work to## ward## s making it profit## able to cultivate alter## native crop## s in the poor countries of the world . 
Mr President , Mr F## rat## tini , lad## ies and gentle## men , the report present## ed to us today by Mr Cata## nia call## s in## to question the policy of zero tolerance and prohibition implement## ed by the Member State## s . 
the rapporteur &apos;## s aim is to amend the current strate## gy and it will be to no one &apos;## s surprise that we have vot## ed again## st this report 
Mr Cata## nia mention## ed the report by the European drug## s and drug addict## ion monitor## ing centre . 
Mr E## sti## even## art was with us last month and point## ed out that , and I quote , &apos; there are posit## ive sign## s that progress ha## s be## en ma## de in re## duc## ing some of the wor## st con## sequenc## es of drug use . &quot; 
he s## aid that the number of drug @## -## @ relate## d death## s ha## s beg## un to fall , that hero## in use ha## s level## led off in a number of countries , that the H## IV epidemic a## mong us## ers is slow## ing and , I quote , &apos; measure## s to reduce drug @## -## @ relate## d harm are intens## ifying and , a## cross much of Europe , drug us## ers have better access to treat## ment and care . &quot; 
this clear## ly demonst## rates that not every## thing ha## s be## en negat## ive . 
much remain## s to be done and , de## spite all the poli## cies that we have be## en pursu## ing , enormous problem## s s## till exist in term## s of the production and traffick## ing of drug## s , and in term## s of drug use , which continu## es to hit extreme## ly high level## s in all Member State## s . 
in light of the access## ion of ten new Member State## s , it is essential that we step up co## operation with the countries that now border the EU . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , there is room for a European anti @## -## @ drug## s policy that fight## s back again## st drug @## -## @ relate## d crime , and that , as per the programme , meet## s the four main object## ive## s of prevent## ing drug use and depend## ency , re## duc## ing the supply and demand of illegal drug## s , limit## ing social and health damage and re## duc## ing crime . 
this is the path that we must follow - the path of combat , not the path of s## lack## ness . 
Mr President , certain fact## s are straight## forward , s## uch as the fact that Europe is the world &apos;## s large## st market for can## na## bi## s . 
is it possible to get rid of drug## s ? 
s## hall we give up and just limit the damage ? 
emphatic## ally not . 
we know that it is specific## ally with can## na## bi## s that most people who end up mis @## -## @ us## ing hero## in , coca## ine and amphetamine## s begin . 
that is why it is cruc## ial for us to ensu## re that few## er new can## na## bi## s us## ers are recruit## ed . 
accord## ing to Mr Cata## nia &apos;## s report , the restrict## ive policy ha## s fail## ed . 
the figure## s from the European Mon## ito## ring Centre for Drug## s and Drug Addi## ction in Lisbon , which was publish## ed a coup## le of week## s ago , is un## ambigu## ous . 
in countries s## uch as Swede## n , with a restrict## ive view of drug## s , 7 % of 15 year @## -## @ old## s have us## ed can## na## bi## s . 
in Great Brit## ain , 4## 2.5 % of all 15 year @## -## @ old boy## s have us## ed can## na## bi## s . 
the restrict## ive policy ha## s led to dramat## ic reduction## s specific## ally in the number of drug us## ers recruit## ed . 
accord## ing to Mr Cata## nia , &apos; soft &quot; drug## s are not danger## ous . 
accord## ing to the Mon## ito## ring Centre &apos;## s new data , there is an increas## ed risk of a range of physic## al and mental problem## s s## uch as depress## ion , psycho## s## es and schizophrenia . 
a review of European drug## s policy is under way right now . 
in countries s## uch as the N## ether## land## s , too , the att## itude ha## s change## d over the last ten year## s . 
now , on## ly a thir## d of the country &apos;## s s## o @## -## @ call## ed coffee shop## s remain . 
the Dutch Just## ice Minister ha## s s## aid that the N## ether## land## s will prob## ably be force## d to alter it## s policy . 
there are high hope## s of revers## ing the trend . 
any## one who want## s to see few## er drug## s in Europe should vot## e again## st Mr Cata## nia &apos;## s report . 
Mr President , I would warn again## st the term## s &apos; soft &quot; and &apos; hard &quot; drug## s . 
talk of soft drug## s give## s out complete## ly the wrong signal## s . 
it make## s these drug## s out to be harm## less , but there are no soft drug## s . 
in## stead , these drug## s - for ex## ample , can## na## bi## s - are often the gate## way to other drug## s . 
I have visit## ed man## y different treat## ment centre## s for drug addict## s where just about all addict## s have agree## d that what are mistake## n## ly call## ed soft drug## s start## ed them off on the drug misuse that destroy## ed the## ir live## s and robb## ed them of the## ir futur## e . 
these addict## s feel ang## ry and frust## rated that soci## ety ha## s not ma## de the danger## s of can## na## bi## s , hash## ish and similar drug## s sufficient## ly clear . 
in my own country , Swede## n , we have combin## ed a restrict## ive drug## s policy and the criminal## isation of drug## s with care and treat## ment for addict## s . 
this combin## ation ha## s prov## ed to be the best way of s## topp## ing drug abuse . 
the small increas## e we have seen in Swede## n in re## cent year## s ha## s be## en due part## ly to the open border## s and part## ly to the influence of the legal## isation debate taking place else## where in the EU . 
thank you ver## y much . 
that conclude## s the list of speaker## s . 
I understand the Commission## er does not wish to take the floor , s## o the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place on Wednesday at 12 n## oon . 
I should like to give the floor to Mr Stu## r## dy , the rapporteur . 
Mr President , may I begin by say## ing what a pleas## ure it is to be here , and I hope that tomor## row when the vot## e is take## n we will have an agree## ment . 
I see Mr Jørgensen is here , and I want to pass some comment## s about the way this Parliament ha## s work## ed . 
Mr Jørgensen came in ver## y late on , be## cause he is a new Member . 
my Liberal , Socialist and Green colleague## s have work## ed ver## y close## ly together on this report . 
I thank them , be## cause it left me in a position of great strength when it came to negoti## ating with the Council , and that is a position all of us in this au## gust House aim for in order to be able to put our point## s forward . 
what is this report about ? 
the idea was to put in place a central harmon## ised system for the control of certain type## s of chemical## s and fix level## s of MRL## s - maxim## um residue level## s - of chemical## s in food## stuff## s . 
the one thing that ha## s not escape## d me , but may well have escape## d other Member## s , is that this is a fore## runner of the REACH Direct## ive , which will be one of the big## gest report## s to come through Parliament . 
if the## y can hand## le it in the way that we hand## led it - I say &apos; we &apos; be## cause all our colleague## s , as I s## aid ear## lier , work## ed together - th## en we s## hall be in an extreme## ly strong position . 
what does it mean to consum## ers , the people who will be affect## ed by this legisl## ation ? 
it mean## s safe## r food a## cross Europe ; it mean## s that if you buy a tomato in Ireland that ha## s come from Spa## in you can guarantee the qual## ity and safety of that product . 
it provid## es a guarantee that Brit## ish lamb sold - da## re I say - to the French is safe . 
that is extreme## ly import## ant for the consum## er . 
we have include## d a number of re## commend## ations where , for in## stance , food is test## ed at the point of sale , which we have all agree## d on . 
how## ever , we also agree## d that import## s need to be of the same level of qual## ity . 
this is import## ant for people who import in## to the European Union . 
the level## s of pest## icide## s have to be of the same standard - not that the## y necess## arily we## re or we## re not ; but it is import## ant that we get that mess## age a## cross for people who come in## to the European Union . 
I s## hall mention brief## ly some thing## s we f## ought over and had great debate## s about . 
good agri## cultural practice## s - GA## P - was a difficult issue , but we go## t a definition with the help of the Commission , which I am de## light## ed to see here today . 
our colleague## s work## ed close## ly with the Commission and , as I s## aid , the Council . 
this is ver## y import## ant in setting a precede## nt for the futur## e , s## o that we know exact## ly what good agri## cultural practice## s are . 
it was some## what difficult to get a position on synerg## istic effect## s , but we now have a situ## ation where we know exact## ly where we are going to be with th## ose effect## s . 
for th## ose who do not know , synerg## istic effect## s are a mixture of chemical## s possibly us## ed on a crop , and there is no particular definition of how the## y are trace## able . 
we have put in place legisl## ation which will work in the futur## e . 
it ha## s left a position open for futur## e Member State## s to be able to define exact## ly what the situ## ation is on synerg## istic effect## s . 
I am concern## ed about how govern## ments will implement this - be## cause it is a regulation and there## fore ha## s to be implement## ed . 
I read re## cent## ly in a paper that govern## ments tend to gold @## -## @ plat## e thing## s . 
it is import## ant , when we are push## ing this through , that govern## ments do not gold @## -## @ plat## e it : we want an equal foot## ing . 
it is interest## ing that the Brit## ish Minister of Agri## culture , Mr## s Be## ck## et## t , ha## s s## aid that s## he will decide when farm## ers can go in## to the field , or when it is too wet or ha## s be## en rain## ing . 
I wonder exact## ly how s## he is going to do that . 
n## ever## the## less , it is import## ant that we do not place govern## ments or countries at a dis## advantage compar## ed to other Member State## s . 
that is why this legisl## ation ha## s be## en put in place . 
it is work## able , it is a good regulation . 
just in case the joint re## solution## s we have agree## d do not go through , the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group ha## s cover## ed it## self ; but I expect all the joint amend## ments to be adopt## ed tomor## row . 
I look forward to see## ing Member State## s implement## ing and work## ing well with it . 
. Mr President , honour## able Member## s , I am pleas## ed that it appear## s that the draft regulation on pest## icide residue## s in food and feed can be adopt## ed at second read## ing . 
the negoti## ations between Council preside## ncy , the European Parliament rapporteur## s and the Commission have re## cent## ly gain## ed moment## um and last week the final obstacle## s we## re clear## ed . 
allow me to under## line the significance of these regulation## s for food safety . 
it will en## able us to set harmon## ised maxim## um residue level## s in the EU for all pest## icide## s and all agri## cultural product## s in one piece of legisl## ation direct## ly appli## cable to all EU citizen## s . 
all situ## ations will be cover## ed , including a list of pest## icide## s for which no maxim## um residue level## s are require## d and the low level that will app## ly system## atic## ally to all pest## icide## s for which we have no inform## ation . 
there will be clar## ity about how and to whom an MRL application should be ma## de , and on the procedure to be follow## ed . 
the European Food Safety Author## ity will carry out the risk assess## ment for consum## ers with the best avail## able method## ology . 
control and enforce## ment by the Member State## s will be reinforce## d and improve## d . 
co## ordination of monitor## ing by the Commission will have a more oblig## atory nature . 
this legisl## ation will benefit all part## ies . 
consum## ers will profit from better protection and more trans## par## ency about which pest## icide## s could be present in food and the## ir potent## ial effect## s . 
food produce## rs will benefit be## cause there will be more clar## ity as to what specific## ations the product## s have to comp## ly with . 
control and enforce## ment bodies will be able to refer to one s## ing## le Comm## un## ity list of maxim## um residue level## s . 
Member State legisl## ators will no long## er need to trans## pose the provision## s in## to national legisl## ation . 
be## fore I finish , I would like to make a few comment## s on the fin## er point## s resolv## ed in the negoti## ations . 
the European Parliament &apos;## s insist## ence on taking cumul## ative and synerg## istic effect## s in## to account may lead to a break## through in the development and application of the necess## ary method## ology . 
I am pleas## ed that this is now explic## it## ly mention## ed in the draft legisl## ation . 
I welcome Parliament &apos;## s de## termination to make an explic## it link between the setting of maxim## um residue level## s and good agri## cultural practice , integrate## d pest manage## ment and the use of the low## est amount## s of pest## icide## s necess## ary . 
the clear require## ment to take in## to account vulner## able group## s of the population , including child## ren and un## born child## ren , is also a use## ful step forward . 
these issue## s make a posit## ive contribut## ion to this regulation . 
the final phase of the negoti## ations saw an increas## ing mutual trust a## mong the part## ies . 
I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromis## e package work## ed out between the three institution## s . 
I trust that you will confirm Parliament &apos;## s accept## ance at the vot## e tomor## row . 
we are now approach## ing the conclusion of this project . 
it is time to acknowledg## e the ef## fort## s of all part## ies and in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr Stu## r## dy , for hi## s hand## ling of this dossier and for the time and ef## fort he ha## s put in## to hi## s report . 
. Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , what we are aim## ing at include## s less bureau## cracy and great## er s## implic## ity ; this s## ing## le Regul## ation is mean## t to replace four basic direct## ive## s on pest## icide residue## s . 
this is not just about food safety and health , but also about equal opportun## ities in comp## et## ing in the internal market and - let us not forget - on the global market . 
produce## rs and process## ors must operate under ident## ical conditio## ns , and all consum## ers are entitle## d to safe food . 
the European Food Safety Author## ity ha## s great respons## ibility where risk manage## ment is concern## ed . 
it is no use what## ever to consum## ers to get , week in and week out , one new warn## ing after an## other , some## time## s peter## ing out in## to s## uch general## isation## s as the statement that , for ex## ample , apple## s from a particular Member State are exceed## ing the maxim## um permit## ted level## s , when s## uch announce## ments are helpful on## ly if the## y include the name of the comp## any who## s## e product## s contain excess## ive residue## s of pest## icide## s . 
we are setting ver## y high standard## s right a## cross the EU , particular## ly where health is concern## ed , and quit## e right## ly too . 
equal## ly , though , we have to look more close## ly at import## s in## to the European Union . 
there is no room for double standard## s here , and what that mean## s - as I see it - is tight## er control## s on import## ed good## s . 
we can## not inter## vene in the## ir production process## es in the way we can with the food produce## d here , and that make## s it all the more import## ant that the end market be check## ed and monitor## ed . 
I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromis## e on the definition of &apos; good agri## cultural practice . &quot; 
Europe &apos;## s farm## ers produce in accord## ance with the most string## ent legal require## ments , as is best known in the case of the rule## s on cross @## -## @ compliance . 
th## ose who farm in accord## ance with the law must also be certain that the## ir product## s pose no health hazard . 
I am grat## e## ful to Mr Stu## r## dy for the work he ha## s done over man## y month## s , and for the good compromis## e that we have be## en able to reach . 
Mr President , I should like to begin by thank## ing Mr Stu## r## dy . 
I think that our co## operation ha## s be## en construct## ive and ha## s proceed## ed in a pleasant and open atmosphere . 
I should like to thank the other &apos; shadow rapporteur## s , &quot; and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound gui## dance and ad## vice we have receiv## ed . 
I am pleas## ed that I have be## en allow## ed to deliver my first speech here in plen## ary on a matter as import## ant as this . 
in actual fact , I see this draft Act or legisl## ation as an ex## ample of the EU at it## s best . 
we s## hall secure a number of thing## s with this draft Act if it is adopt## ed in the form in which we should like to have it adopt## ed . 
first## ly , cross @## -## @ border trade is of course ens## ured . 
a varie## ty of food## s is guarantee## d , as is the## ir pre## s## ence on the shelve## s at lower price## s . 
other , s## till more import## ant , thing## s are , how## ever , also ens## ured , name## ly consum## ers &quot; health , safety and securit## y in connect## ion with the food## s the## y buy . 
I come from a ver## y cold country up in the north , s## o I am pleas## ed to be able to buy fruit and veget## able## s in the winter too . 
I am on## ly pleas## ed , how## ever , if I can be s## ure that the apple I eat is also health## y , and this is some## thing that this legisl## ation can help ensu## re . 
I s## hall mention a coup## le of the area## s it ha## s be## en e## special## ly import## ant for us Soci## al Democrat## s to see success## fully deal## t with and in which I think we have achiev## ed compromis## es with which every## one can be satisfied . 
first## ly , I want to mention the consider## ation give## n to e## special## ly vulner## able group## s . 
it is one thing to devi## s## e legisl## ation with a view to robust , health## y and vigorous men s## uch as Mr Stu## r## dy and my## self . 
that is fine , of course . 
there also need## s , how## ever , to be legisl## ation with a view to more vulner## able group## s s## uch as child## ren , born and as y## et un## born . 
that too is some## thing , I am pleas## ed to say , that we have obtain## ed . 
an## other thing I would emphasis## e - and I would now apolog## ise to the interpret## ers for the## y are about to be confront## ed by difficult express## ions again - is that we have in## corporate## d cumul## ative effect## s that are the result of synerg## y . 
that is extreme## ly import## ant . 
it sound## s a li## ttle technical , but in re## ality it is quit## e simpl## e . 
the fact is , it is not en## ough on## ly to take account of how poison## ous or non @## -## @ poison## ous a pest## icide is . 
we must also take account of how poison## ous or non @## -## @ poison## ous two or three or four pest## icide## s are when the## y interact , that is to say when the## y react to e## ach other in a particular food . 
that is some## thing it is in## cred## ibly import## ant to take account of . 
it is an area about which we do not know much at present , but one about which we need to know more in the futur## e and of which we must take more account . 
other## wise , there may be major con## sequenc## es in term## s of health . 
I fear that that is al## read## y now the case . 
my thir## d point is that it is all well and good to have control## s and legisl## ation , but we also need to ensu## re that there are sanction## s . 
I think that nam## ing and s## ham## ing is a sens## ible idea . 
I think it is sens## ible of us now to oblig## e the Member State## s to publish the## ir control result## s on the Inter## net . 
it also bring## s about open## ness , which in turn produce## s securit## y . 
the consum## er must have peace of mind , and that is some## thing we are in this way guarantee## ing . 
four## th## ly and final## ly , I think it encourag## ing that we have obtain## ed some clear and construct## ive definition## s , including definition## s of good agri## cultural practice and an actual definition of maxim## um limit value## s . 
these we## re not e## asy thing## s to negotiate success## fully but , e## special## ly through sound gui## dance from the Council and the Commission , we obtain## ed a compromis## e with which every## one can be pleas## ed and which will help secure our object## ive## s . 
I would say that , all in all , this is a propos## al that may make a posit## ive differ## ence to the every## day life of European## s , and that is some## thing I am pleas## ed about and proud to be associate## d with . 
Mr President , the draft law we are deba## ting in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for European## s &quot; con## fidence in food safety . 
it is in## cred## ibly import## ant for all our vot## ers in our vari## ous constitue## ncies , but it is particular## ly import## ant per## hap## s for parent## s with aller## gic child## ren . 
our amend## ments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alli## ance of Liberal## s and Democrat## s for Europe think is reason## able for bring## ing about a propos## al that is effective from the point## s of view bo## th of competit## ion and of consum## er protection . 
I should like to emphasis## e a few thing## s . 
the internal market is in## cred## ibly import## ant . 
in this internal market , we wish to protect our citizen## s and , at the same time , set standard## s for test## ing and treat## ing food at th## ose link## s in the chain where the food concern## ed first come## s in## to contact with the consum## er and first enter## s the distribut## ion chain . 
in this respect , this propos## al is sound . 
it is also sound ina## s## much as it protect## s import## ant and vulner## able high @## -## @ risk group## s s## uch as women , infant## s and un## born child## ren . 
we are also adopt## ing a position on a standard for good agri## cultural practice . 
in this , we have take## n account bo## th of integrate## d pest control and of climate vari## ations in order to bring about a fair## er propos## al . 
it is in## cred## ibly import## ant that these opt## ions for taking account of local or regional vari## ations should not reduce the propos## al &apos;## s level of ambit## ion . 
this is some## thing that ha## s to be consider## ed in connect## ion with the practical application of the propos## al , o## nce it ha## s proper## ly enter## ed in## to force . 
it is good that there have be## en improve## ments to the Food Safety Author## ity in term## s of bo## th time and resource## s . 
I also think that the rapporteur ha## s done a ver## y good job . 
I am pleas## ed that we have be## en able to make it easi## er for civil soci## ety and the non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s to particip## ate in the discuss## ion and hand## ling of these issue## s . 
Mr President , it is ver## y late now and ver## y few of us are left but n## ever## the## less we are deal## ing with a ver## y import## ant issue . 
it is a p## ity that o## nce again in this Parliament legisl## ation is left until the end of the day . 
in a re## cent opinion poll 77 per cent of Brit## ish people s## aid that the## y are concern## ed about pest## icide## s in food s## o , as every## one ha## s s## aid , what we are do## ing here reson## ate## s with public opinion . 
I am ver## y pleas## ed that we have a compromis## e and that we agree on the main thing## s . 
there are two issue## s which particular## ly concern me and I am ver## y pleas## ed that we have secure## d a deal on them . 
the first is cumul## ative and synerg## istic effect## s : cock## tail effect## s . 
we we## re told that there is no method## ology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research suggest## s is at the root of our problem## s . 
I am ver## y pleas## ed to hear the Commission## er say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making s## ure that we get more research in## to the cumul## ative effect## s . 
that is why I table## d the amend## ment to recital 5 . 
one problem is that a lot of expert## s say that these cumul## ative effect## s are un## found## ed , but we have nothing to prove or dis## prove this . 
we must get this research , it is ver## y import## ant . 
the second issue mention## ed by Mr Jørgensen is about the effect## s on child## ren and the un## born . 
a lot of research suggest## s that child## ren and the un## born have in some way be## en affect## ed by either pest## icide## s or chemical## s in our environment . 
in a re## cent radio programme about chemical## s the## y di## d a s## eries of test## s on a grand## mother , a mother , and a grand## daughter . 
these test## s show## ed that the high## est level of chemical## s was found not in the grand## mother - who had live## d through the high## est level## s of poll## ution in our street## s in the 19## 30## s , 19## 40## s and 19## 50## s - but in the grand## daughter who was 15 year## s old . 
the## y found in her blood chemical## s that had be## en take## n off our shelve## s man## y year## s be## fore## hand . 
we know that some of these sub## stance## s come in through pest## icide## s . 
it is extreme## ly import## ant that we start look## ing not just at test## ing on adult## s but at test## ing on child## ren and look## ing at the effect## s on bab## ies in the womb . 
public con## fidence in food safety and food standard## s is ver## y low . 
in the survey that I refer## red to ear## lier , over 50 % of Brit## ish people s## aid the## y di## d not believ## e that govern## ment re## assurance## s about pest## icide## s we## re accurate . 
con## sequent## ly we need to get it right . 
scientific research show## s that import## ed product## s have more pest## icide## s th## an product## s grown with## in the EU . 
this is extreme## ly import## ant legisl## ation . 
I am ver## y grat## e## ful to Mr Stu## r## dy , Mr Jørgensen and all th## ose with## in the Commission and the Council who work## ed ver## y hard to achiev## e a compromis## e that we can all support tomor## row . 
thank you ver## y much . 
that conclude## s the list of speaker## s . 
I understand the Commission## er does not wish to take the floor , s## o the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place on Wednesday at 12 n## oon . 
the next item is the Commission and Council statement## s on the prepar## ation of the European Council ( 17 Dec## ember 20## 04 ) . 
. Mr President , the forth## coming European Council in Bru## ssels will be the first for the new Commission . 
it will be an import## ant meet## ing , mark## ing the next step## s in the process of build## ing a large## r , more prosper## ous and safe## r European Union . 
it will be a sign of our ambit## ion for a Union which is dynamic and on the move ; a Union read## y to share it## s desti## ny with the European fami## ly ; a Union which is concern## ed about the securit## y of it## s citizen## s . 
I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of co## operation . 
how else can we generate the trust in Europe &apos;## s institution## s and politic## ians that is need## ed for a smooth rat## ification of the Constitution ? 
we have heard from the preside## ncy about it## s expect## ations and the issue## s that the summit will address . 
let me comment brief## ly on three issue## s : enlarge## ment , the fight again## st terrorism and the financial perspective## s . 
first## ly , our policy of enlarge## ment of the Union ha## s be## en the key in free## ing us from our cold war past . 
the gravitat## ional pull of the prospect of EU member## ship ha## s transform## ed and modernise## d sever## al post @## -## @ communist soci## e## ties . 
it ha## s thu## s re## shape## d the European order . 
this was and remain## s an achiev## e## ment of histo## ric proportion## s that we should not under## estimate . 
your House ha## s be## en instrument## al in support## ing this process , but our enlarge## ment is s## till in## complete . 
this European Council will take the next step## s for four countries , offer## ing them the potent## ial - through enlarge## ment - to join the European mainstream . 
last October the Commission ma## de it clear that it should be possible to conclude the access## ion negoti## ations with Bulgaria and Roman## ia in 20## 04 . 
in## de## ed , this negoti## ating process was closed yesterday , thank## s to the increas## ed ef## fort## s by the European Union and by these two countries . 
I congratul## ate the N## ether## land## s preside## ncy for it## s excel## lent work and close co## operation with the Commission on that particular subject . 
the Access## ion Treat## y for bo## th countries now need## s to be final## ised and we hope that it can be sign## ed after receiv## ing the assent of this House d## uring the spring of next year . 
in the remain## ing period up to access## ion , the Commission will be watch## ing close## ly to see that bo## th countries deliver on the commit## ments ma## de d## uring the negoti## ations , and in some case## s this will mean a further accele## ration in the## ir ef## fort## s . 
at the re## quest of the European Council , on 6 October the Commission adopt## ed it## s report on Tur## key and a clear re## commend## ation . 
the main mess## age in the Commission &apos;## s assess## ment is that Tur## key ha## s sufficient## ly fulfill## ed the C## open## hagen political crite## ria and that access## ion negoti## ations should now be open## ed . 
we consider this re## commend## ation , which was ver## y care## fully prepar## ed , to be well balance## d and a good bas## is for a decision by the Council . 
I am look## ing forward to taking comfort from the position your House will take on this question later today . 
Tur## key ha## s ma## de further progress in the last week## s . 
it ha## s adopt## ed f## ive of the six piece## s of legisl## ation signal## led by the Commission in it## s report ; the six## th law , on the execu## tion of sentenc## es , is pend## ing be## fore the Turk## ish Parliament . 
it is now time for the European Council to honour it## s commit## ment to Tur## key and announce the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations . 
a clear d## ate should be indic## ated . 
we consider that , apart from the matter## s I have just mention## ed , no other conditio## ns ought to be add## ed . 
the European Council will no doubt wish to recall that political reform## s will have to continu## e in the course of the negoti## ations and ask the Commission to monitor further progress close## ly . 
we should also ask our Turk## ish friend## s in all honest## y : if you want to become a member of a club , is it not normal that you recognis## e the other member## s of the club ? 
I am convince## d that this will come at the right moment in the course of this difficult process , and prefer## ably s## oon## er th## an later . 
the object## ive of start## ing negoti## ations can## not be other th## an access## ion but we accept that the access## ion process is open @## -## @ end## ed and it## s out## come can## not be guarantee## d be## fore## hand . 
as in the past , transit## ional arrange## ments and certain specific safeguard## s may need to be consider## ed . 
but let me state what our ultimate challenge will be : in the end , we need not on## ly to over## come diploma## tic obstacle## s , but also to conquer the heart## s and mind## s of European citizen## s on this issue . 
Croatia represent## s the first of the Western Balkan nation## s prepar## ing to start the process for access## ion to the Union . 
the Commission is read## y to support the launch of s## uch negoti## ations , but believ## es that any progress should be conditional on increas## ed co## operation between the Croatia## n Govern## ment and the Inter## national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslav## ia . 
if s## uch co## operation is confirm## ed , th## en negoti## ations can be start## ed in 20## 05 . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , with your permiss## ion I should like to turn to one of the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury &apos;## s key challenge## s , and one which we will also discuss at this week &apos;## s Council summit , name## ly the threat of international terrorism . 
what we are deal## ing with here is the ug## ly face of global## isation . 
international terrorism exploit## s the advantage## s of plural## ist soci## e## ties to attack the ver## y found## ations of th## ose soci## e## ties - our free## dom## s . 
I hope that at the end of the week we will reach further agree## ments on how terrorism can be f## ought . 
we must show our un## waver## ing de## termination , but we must n## ever lose sight of the democratic and legal principle## s which are at the ver## y bas## is of our soci## ety and our prosper## ity . 
the European Commission ha## s play## ed an active role in promot## ing and prepar## ing an update## d EU action plan on the fight again## st international terrorism , and I should like to make absolut## e## ly clear what we hope the out## come of the decision## s to be take## n at the end of the week will be . 
these decision## s must help us to ensu## re that the EU will be better prepar## ed to prevent and respond to terrorist attack## s , as well as allow## ing us to block the source## s of fund## ing for terrorist## s to a great## er ex## tent th## an pre## vi## ously , im## prov## ing our ability to manage the after## math of an attack and , final## ly , ens## uring better protection for our key infra## structure## s . 
we should not limit our## selves to fight## ing terrorism by force . 
we should also oppose it## s per## verse log## ic , by tack## ling the ideo## logical and social factor## s which lead individual## s to commit s## uch act## s . 
long @## -## @ term commit## ment and a clear political de## termination will be necess## ary to over## come this scourge . 
the discuss## ions at the summit will also take stock of the situ## ation regard## ing the Fina## ncial Perspective## s for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
I s## till believ## e that the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s are sound , bas## ed as the## y are on a broad political con## sensus on what the EU must do . 
the truth is that the political project on which the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s are bas## ed was not actual## ly at risk . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s there## fore constitut## e a valid work## ing bas## is . 
the current ceil## ing for own resource## s remain## s in place de## spite new re## quest## s to the EU due to the enlarge## ment and to the development of new poli## cies . 
the## y are there## fore reason## able propos## al## s . 
what we want to offer , how## ever , is actual add## ed European value , on top of what is offer## ed at national level . 
of course , we must ensu## re disciplin## e in the budget## ary process , but this can## not be achiev## ed by setting arbit## rary limit## s , with## out reference to what the budget aim## s to achiev## e . 
I am aware that some Member State## s remain convince## d that the EU budget should be limit## ed to 1 % of gross national re## venue . 
I do not believ## e that the EU &apos;## s policy object## ive## s are compatible with s## uch a figure . 
are we prepar## ed to abandon the challenge## s of social and economic cohes## ion , which are all the more press## ing after enlarge## ment ? 
are we re## ally be## ing serious as regard## s the policy of invest## ing in the major trans @## -## @ European transport network## s ? 
are we re## ally be## ing serious as regard## s the need to foster the European research policy ? 
how can we ensu## re a European contribut## ion to## ward## s combat## ing terrorism and to## ward## s safeguard## ing our citizen## s &quot; securit## y ? 
let me state this to you clear## ly : we can## not have more Europe with less money and a union cease## s to be a union if the object## ive of cohes## ion is for## gotten . 
a 1 % limit would force us to cut back on our political object## ive## s and would force us to re @## -## @ assess commit## ments al## read## y ma## de . 
the Commission &apos;## s position is there## fore clear : our start## ing point is the package submit## ted in Fe## bru## ary of last year . 
in spite of the Dutch Presidency &apos;## s ver## y hard work , the negoti## ations have , thu## s far , y## et to re## ally begin . 
I sincere## ly hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will be able to drive this process forward and ensu## re that effective negoti## ations go a## head , be## cause it is import## ant that we respect the time## table establish## ed in the Council &apos;## s multi## annual strategic programme . 
we must ensu## re that the programme## s are fully up and running by 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
this mean## s that we must reach a political agree## ment in Ju## ne of next year . 
there is one thing I can promise : as al## ways , the Commission will not be the s## tumbl## ing block to the out## come of negoti## ations . 
we s## hall help the Member State## s to reach agree## ments , but not at any price . 
in the short time between the confirm## ation of the new Commission and the forth## coming European Council , we will have seen import## ant development## s bo## th international## ly - in particular in Ukraine - and for the Union . 
with the decision## s on enlarge## ment and securit## y that the European Council will take this week , we are show## ing in practical ways our con## fidence in the futur## e of our continent . 
we are show## ing how we can succeed in project## ing the value## s that we hold dear in## to the international arena and extend## ing the ring of prosper## ity , solid## arity and securit## y further a## cross our continent and the world . 
. - Mr President , as with all European Council## s , the next one ha## s some ver## y interest## ing topic## s to discuss . 
I would go further and say that the## y are not just interest## ing ; the## y are per## hap## s cruc## ial to our Union &apos;## s collect## ive futur## e . 
con## sequent## ly , not on## ly will the Head## s of State or Govern## ment be taking part , but also the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission . 
at this time , we must ask for three in## dispens## able qual## ities : ambit## ion , adequate resource## s and practical idea## s . 
let us look at what this mean## s with regard to e## ach of th## ose topic## s . 
whi## lst the process of admit## ting Bulgaria and Roman## ia appear## s to be going well and the result of genuine ef## fort## s on the part of the two countries , we are strong## ly aware , how## ever , that Roman## ia need## s to s## print down the home straight . 
whi## lst we too have no doubt## s about Croatia - you on## ly need to have be## en to Za## gre## b or Du## br## ov## ni## k to appreci## ate how embed## d## ed it is in European culture - Tur## key is a special case , not on## ly due to it## s geo## graphy , but also due to it## s peculiar cultural and economic character## istic## s . 
the case of Cyprus must not be s## wept under the carp## et while we discuss negoti## ations . 
n## ever## the## less , the open## ing of negoti## ations will un## doubt## ed## ly help to clar## ify for bo## th side## s man## y area## s that are current## ly in doubt and it will eventual## ly be possible to gauge more clear## ly what kind of Union would be prefer## able to bo## th side## s . 
after all , there are other type## s of union apart from marriage that could potent## ial## ly be consider## ed . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , terrorism is certain## ly one of the Council &apos;## s most import## ant port## folio## s and we must combat it global## ly and un## s## tint## ing## ly . 
rogue states that harbour international terrorism , with vary## ing degree## s of legal## ity , must be sanction## ed by the EU with## out delay . 
international co## operation at vari## ous level## s - political , financial or operation## al - must also take place with## out delay . 
in this area , there must be no delay and no lack of resource## s . 
this bring## s me to the Fina## ncial Perspective## s , a port## folio that , as far as we are concern## ed , will set the tone for Europe &apos;## s desir## e to deepen our Union . 
the resource## s must match the ambit## ion . 
this is some## thing that Jacque## s Del## ors s## aid , and with good reason . 
it is not possible , more## over , to cheat the countries that re## cent## ly join## ed our European Union , nor th## ose look## ing hope## fully to the EU as an engine to propel demo## cracy and development forward in the## ir countries . 
let us be clear . 
to think that Europe , the new Europe , our Europe , can be built with the resource## s of the past is a fall## acy and it is worth say## ing that if ambit## ion and solid## arity do not go hand in hand at this summit and in the orient## ations and guide## line## s that are adopt## ed , we should be ashamed of our current leader## s . 
Mr President , this bring## s me to external affair## s . 
the Council service## s tell us that the Council is to discuss the Middle East , Iran , Iraq , Afghan## istan , the Medi## terranean Partner## ship and , I should add , prob## ably the situ## ation in Ukraine , Dar## fur , relation## s with Chi## na and Russia and even Trans## atlantic relation## s . 
what I am wonder## ing is that with an age## nda of which I have on## ly mention## ed a few topic## s , with the desir## e for a joint , EU @## -## @ level external service , what resource## s will we use to seek to influence the international scene ? 
will we continu## e to be a soft power , striv## ing for multilateral## ism with## out be## ing in any way active on the international scene ? or will we have at our dispos## al the resource## s - the appropriate resource## s - to final## ly stop be## ing the political dwarf of the international scene ? 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I s## hall conclude by say## ing what I s## aid at the begin## ning . 
it is cruc## ial that we s## peak about the Lisbon Strategy , about combat## ing drug## s or AIDS , about the new neighbour## hood policy and about sustain## able development . 
if , how## ever , we do not have the three element## s of ambit## ion , adequate resource## s and practical idea## s , we will be s## peak## ing as though we we## re aut## istic . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should ver## y much like to have be## en present at a meet## ing of the Port## uguese Soci## al Democrat## s . 
the President of the Commission , Mr Barros## o , ha## s frequent## ly told us of hi## s &apos; blind d## ate## s , &quot; which have attract## ed the particular interest of this House . 
this morning I have now heard from Mr Pinheiro that he prefer## s form## s of cohabit## ation other th## an marriage . 
interest## ing thing## s are going on in Port## ugal . 
in this in## stance , Mr Pinheiro , we are no advoc## ate## s of the common law marriage the EU is to enter in## to with Tur## key . 
we wish relation## s between the EU and Tur## key to be strong , re## sil## ient , and s## table - in good Christ## ian Democrat style . 
I would also warn you again## st s## peak## ing of cultural differ## ence## s , Mr Pinheiro . 
this communit## y of value## s is open to every## one who share## s these value## s , with## out any kind of cultural relativ## ity , and this is a point I should like to reiterate o## nce again . 
this is self @## -## @ evident to our group , and , yesterday , we decide## d with what I think was al## most 99 % of vot## es with## in our group .## .. 
in an open ballot , not a secret ballot , to give Mr Eur## ling## s our support for hi## s belief that , if this order of value## s can be enshrine## d in a Mus## lim soci## ety , it will be proof that this order of value## s is open to every person , of what## ever religio## n , skin colour and cultural or ethnic back## ground the## y may be . 
the reason why this is s## uch an import## ant issue , Mr Pinheiro , is that the fight again## st terrorism is also a subject for discuss## ion at the European Council summit and d## uring the prelimin## ary debate## s . 
I believ## e that there is a direct connect## ion between this issue and the question of whet## her we will manage to dis## prove the the## ory that the Islam of the most danger## ous terrorist## s current## ly active , the Islamic fundamental## ists , which the## y describ## e as the on## ly Islam , and the order of value## s I refer## red to a moment ago are mutual## ly exclus## ive . 
I believ## e that the mer## e open## ing of negoti## ations with Tur## key , a step which also mean## s that Tur## key is prepar## ed to submit to the Constitution and it## s rule## s , is evidence that the implement## ation of a secular social re## ality is not link## ed in any way to religio## n , but in## stead to the political will of a people . 
this is the cruc## ial point , and this is an import## ant contribut## ion to the fight again## st terrorism . 
I there## fore believ## e that the debate on Tur## key and the debate on the fight again## st terrorism are two side## s of the same coin . 
d## uring yesterday &apos;## s prepar## ations for today &apos;## s debate , we too discuss## ed Roman## ia and Bulgaria , and development## s in bo## th these countries . 
I will not den## y that we regret that our friend , Mr Nastase , lo## st the p## resident## ial elect## ions . 
it was a fair decision , and we should like to congratul## ate Mr Bas## es## c## u . 
we on## ly hope that Mr Bas## es## c## u ha## s a sufficient sense of respons## ibility , some## thing which he di## d not demonst## rate d## uring the elect## ion campaign , not to enter in## to coal## ition## s with part## ies in hi## s country which are oppose## d to the European Union and which ride rough## shod over our fundamental value## s . 
you may be s## ure , Mr Wat## son , that we will continu## e to observ## e Roman## ia as close## ly as you have done to d## ate , particular## ly with regard to the issue of whet## her the futur## e Roman## ian President form## s a coal## ition with the extreme right . 
this is some## thing you can depend on , and some## thing we will observ## e particular## ly close## ly . 
we believ## e that the debate that is on the Council &apos;## s age## nda .## .. 
should consolidate what the European Union ha## s achiev## ed in it## s role as medi## ator in Ukraine under the Dutch Presidency of the Council . 
on be## half of our group , I should like to say - and I also address these word## s to the Dutch Presidency - that the European Union ha## s provid## ed an enormous amount of support through## out what ha## s be## en going on in Ukraine over re## cent week## s , which represent## s a fundamental shift in the internal political situ## ation to## ward## s demo## cracy , free## dom and human right## s . 
it was the EU that acted as medi## ator in the country , and I believ## e that the staunch support of all th## ose concern## ed , including the Dutch Presidency , ha## s ma## de it possible to achiev## e progress which will result in a great## er degree of demo## cracy , and which ha## s prov## en that a unit## ed European Union , combin## ing it## s force## s and deploy## ing them joint## ly , can make a genuine contribut## ion to international politic## s . 
for this we are grat## e## ful , and we would like to extend our renew## ed thank## s to all th## ose involve## d , including Mr Sol## ana , Mr K## wa## ś## ni## e## w## ski and also the Dutch Presidency . 
Mr Nicolaï , I would ask you to pass on our group &apos;## s thank## s to the Council . 
. Mr President , the N## ether## land## s preside## ncy is like## ly to be re## member## ed for the decision on Tur## key . 
a major## ity of the member## s of the Alli## ance of Liberal## s and Democrat## s for Europe believ## e that Tur## key ful## fil## s the political crite## ria and that you should open negoti## ations . 
it seem## s to us import## ant that Europe should not define it## self as a Christ## ian club . 
and y## et , by the same token , we must be## ware of an aggress## ive secular## ism , which could drive away man## y of th## ose who belong in our communit## y . 
I pay trib## ute to the work of Mr Eur## ling## s in draw## ing up the report on Tur## key for this House ; a report which I think command## s wide## spread support . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , when it discuss## es Tur## key , your Council will meet in secret . 
it is import## ant that in this House , when we discuss and vot## e on Tur## key , we do s## o open## ly and in public and not in secret . 
I also re## commend to the Council that we have a discuss## ion in our Union about the European Union &apos;## s capacity to absorb new Member State## s , particular## ly countries beyond th## ose which current## ly have candid## ate status . 
I re## commend that we have a discuss## ion on the nature of the European Union , be## cause it is our vision of the European Union that will determine it## s border## s , ra## ther th## an our vision of countries wish## ing to join . 
the Council will also discuss Bulgaria and Roman## ia . 
my Group ha## s long believ## ed that these two countries - and in## de## ed other## s - should have separat## e access## ion treat## ies . 
Bulgaria closed all of it## s negoti## ating chap## ter## s ear## lier this year and ha## s ma## de good progress . 
in Roman## ia , progress ha## s be## en much less e## asy to see . 
for me , the elect## ion result## s this week give cause for hope . 
I believ## e that the concern## s of man## y can now be set a## side and that with resolv## e and good## will , we can bring Roman## ia in## to the European Union effective## ly in 20## 07 . 
I say to my friend Mr Schu## lz : for heav## en &apos;## s sake stop defend## ing corrupt social## ist regime## s , whet## her in the Mal## d## ive## s , the Seych## elles or in Roman## ia . 
I thought Mr Bas## es## c## u was actual## ly a member of the Socialist Inter## national , but I may be wrong . 
you should not be defend## ing regime## s which are do## ing thing## s that are not worthy of your party . 
I believ## e that we now have the chance to move a## head with Roman## ia and we must do s## o . 
on Croatia , President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , I re## commend that you hold open the door , but insist on full co## operation with the Inter## national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslav## ia . 
high on your age## nda , too , will be terrorism and I pay trib## ute to the work of the Council &apos;## s anti @## -## @ terrorism co## ordinator . 
you need prompt## ly to put in## to practice measure## s that have be## en ident## ified in the Ha## gue Pro## gramme relev## ant to combat## ing terrorism , in particular , measure## s re## l## ating to exchange of inform## ation between Member State## s . 
ef## fort## s to combat terrorism must respect human right## s and fundamental free## dom## s and the Council must stress the import## ance of promot## ing respect bas## ed on universal value## s , tolerance , dia## logue and democratic particip## ation . 
too often , our approach in this Union to the creation of an area of free## dom , securit## y and justice ha## s concentr## ated on securit## y and justice at the expense of free## dom . 
I hope that your preside## ncy , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , will ensu## re that the balance is set right . 
we need to get our police force## s and judic## iary work## ing together . 
we need to move the European Union from be## ing simpl## y an economic communit## y in## to see## ing it## self as a communit## y of value## s . 
but for that to have the support of our citizen## s , it mean## s recognis## ing the fundamental import## ance of the value## s out## line## d in our Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
the appropriate financial frame## work will be discuss## ed in a build## ing apt## ly name## d after a Dutch## man , Mr Just## us Lipsius . 
my Group welcome## s the method## ical approach of your preside## ncy to prepar## ations for the Union &apos;## s budget from 20## 07 to 20## 13 , but we are not s## ure whet## her your build## ing block## s are in## dependent build## ing block## s or a Rubi## k &apos;## s C## u## be . 
is any out## come possible other th## an the one per cent to which your country was a sign## atory in the letter to Mr Pro## di ? 
it seem## s to my Group that we need to give the European Union the resource## s it need## s . 
it is better to spend 1.2 per cent well th## an to spend less th## an 1 per cent bad## ly . 
while , as a Scot , I welcome the approach of my soul## mate## s in the N## ether## land## s to the financ## ing of the Union , I believ## e that the Council must give the Union the resource## s it need## s . 
you must also heed the report of the Court of Audit## ors and tackle the fail## ure in our Member State## s to put adequate control## s in place on the spend## ing of European Union money . 
in conclusion , the Council will discuss ESD## P . 
operation &apos; Althea &apos; is work## ing success## fully and three other on## going mission## s are ex## ample## s of solid progress . 
let the Union &apos;## s voice be heard in our neighbour## hood policy and in our relation## s with Chi## na , the Unit## ed State## s and Russia . 
al## though the head## line of the forth## coming European Council may be Tur## key - and we should expect no less for a pillar of European civil## isation - beyond the head## line## s there is much import## ant work to do in foreign and securit## y policy . 
Mr President , I have n## ever ma## de use of this Rule be## fore , but I would ask to be allow## ed the follow## ing clar## ification . 
I would n## ever defend a corrupt regime , whet## her head## ed by social## ists or by any## one else , and this is some## thing I should like to stress at this point . 
ra## ther th## an defend## ing any## one , I mer## e## ly appeal## ed to Mr Bas## es## c## u . 
I ma## de no reference to any corrupt politic## ian , in any country , and I should like , here and now , to say that any person who is corrupt should be punish## ed and should not head a govern## ment . 
it is how## ever equal## ly un## accept## able for people to come under general suspicion mer## e## ly be## cause the## y belong to a certain political fami## ly . 
it is clear that Mr Schu## lz ha## s spoken pursu## ant to Rule 14## 5 of the Rule## s of Procedure , which allow## s Member## s to s## peak for three minute## s in respons## e to personal comment## s ma## de d## uring the debate . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I s## hall use two minute## s of Mr Schu## lz &apos;## s s## peak## ing time , which mean## s that I have f## ive minute## s to s## peak . 
our debate today is on culture , and on what is and what is not European culture . 
it is an issue on which I should like to make a few comment## s . 
I am al## ways sceptic## al when any## one tell## s me that thing## s are cultural## ly in## compatible , and this is per## hap## s due to fami## ly reason## s . 
we are all aware of how often Jew## s have be## en persecut## ed for mar## ry## ing non @## -## @ Jew## s , and how often white people have be## en persecut## ed for mar## ry## ing black people , and s## uch persecut## ion ha## s al## ways be## en car## ried out under the pre## text of cultural in## com## pat## ibility . 
I am also astonish## ed at the emotional fer## vour , or in some case## s even political blind## ness , with which debate## s re## l## ating to Tur## key are conduct## ed . 
I am well aware that there are worthy people with worthy argument## s who are oppose## d to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the EU . 
it is entire## ly normal for worthy argument## s to exist bo## th for and again## st s## uch an access## ion , and y## et I am perplex## ed by the level of aggress## ive## ness of th## ose who are oppose## d to Tur## key join## ing the EU . 
the bas## is for rac## ism is al## ways irrational## ity , and I can## not help but think that certain argument## s again## st Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion are not political , but pur## e## ly cultural , or , in other word## s , racist . 
we can## not toler## ate s## uch a thing . 
what kind of an ex## ample are we setting to Tur## key and to the world ? 
Mr Po## ette## ring ha## s told this House that this is the most import## ant decision to be take## n by the European Parliament and by Europe in re## cent year## s , and that , as it is s## o import## ant , we should take the decision in ut## most secrecy , s## o that every## one is left in the dark with regard to how we have reach## ed our position on this import## ant issue . 
this House is to hold a secret ballot . 
can you just be quiet ? 
after## ward## s , you may s## peak for three minute## s , like Mr Schu## lz . 
I s## hall say what I wish to say , and you may say what you wish to say . 
you may s## peak after I have finish## ed . 
if Member## s of this House demand secrecy , it is be## cause the## y do not want vot## ers through## out Europe to know where we as individual Member## s stand on this key issue . 
it is a dis## grace to demo## cracy that the vot## e should be conduct## ed in this way . 
it is a scandal . 
you should give some consider## ation to what the people of Tur## key will think . 
one can perfect## ly well be oppose## d to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , but what will the men and women of Tur## key think if the## y are told that this is an issue the## y are not allow## ed to know any## thing about ? 
do European## s re## ally want us to hold s## itt## ing## s in public and to provid## e public record## s of vot## es , as preach## ed repeat## ed## ly and e## special## ly in Mr Po## ette## ring &apos;## s incessant sermon## s to the Council ? 
this is some## thing we wish to know , and this is some## thing that is enshrine## d in the Constitution . 
this Parliament , a moral author## ity for good behaviour , ha## s sudden## ly decide## d on the most in## comprehens## ible and un## democratic course of action possible , and I find this im## possible to understand . 
I should like to make one more remark on Roman## ia . 
cultural differ## ence## s some## time## s also exist between the EU and soci## e## ties which will short## ly be join## ing it , for ex## ample the perv## as## ive corrupt## ion in Roman## ia , some## thing which is a simpl## e fact . 
we there## fore call on the Roman## ian Parliament to take us serious## ly . 
Roman## ia should be accept## ed in## to the EU , but on## ly after it ha## s met the C## open## hagen crite## ria . 
at present it does not y## et meet them , which is a fact that must be stated , and we should not accept it until it does . 
Roman## ia will be accept## ed .## .. 
.## .. make use of a Rule of which other## s have also avail## ed them## selves , and I have no doubt## s as to this be## ing the case . 
de## spite any claim## s to the contr## ary by Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , I am not connect## ed in any way to this matter , and I dis## approve of hi## s having us## ed bog## us argument## s which bear no relation to the truth . 
. Mr President , on 17 Dec## ember a decision is to be take## n on whet## her access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key should be open## ed . 
access## ion to the EU represent## s a major opportun## ity for Tur## key , as there is s## till a need for the value## s it represent## s , s## uch as the rule of law , demo## cracy and human right## s , to gain accept## ance there . 
there is there## fore an ur## gent need for the negoti## ations to be conduct## ed trans## parent## ly , and for the democratic change## s necess## ary in Tur## key to be spell## ed out . 
this is particular## ly tru## e in the case of the viol## ent clash## es in the Kurd## ish region## s , and I would call on the Kurd## s and the Turk## ish arm## ed force## s to reach a cease## fire and to seek a political solution . 
I am extreme## ly concern## ed at the increas## e in human right## s viol## ations and homi## cides , for ex## ample the case of the 12 @## -## @ year @## -## @ old Ur## ud and hi## s father , as well as the new proceed## ing## s which have be## en initiate## d with the aim of ban## ning the Union of Educ## ation and Sc## ience Work## ers . 
if there are to be access## ion negoti## ations , it would be up to Tur## key to demonst## rate , by mean## s of a genuine implement## ation of it## s reform plan## s , that all Turk## ish citizen## s , regard## less of the## ir origin , are accord## ed the same right## s , that there is equal## ity of the s## ex## es and that certain religio## ns are no long## er discrimin## ated again## st in favour of other## s . 
it is cruc## ial for the Ankara Govern## ment not on## ly to adopt law## s in order to meet the C## open## hagen crite## ria , but also to implement them in practice . 
the 20 million Kurd## s in Tur## key hope that , when access## ion negoti## ations are open## ed , the## ir right## s , too , will be secure## d , that the## y will be able to express the## ir ident## ity free## ly , that the## y will be acknowledg## ed and that it will become possible for them to return to the## ir village## s . 
it is necess## ary for the village guard system to be abolish## ed and for the 10 % clause for elect## ions to be reduce## d . 
last week## end thousand## s of people demonst## rated in Diyarbakir for the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations . 
as a Germa## n MEP of Kurd## ish origin , I should like to join my group in call## ing for access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key to be open## ed , and we call on all Head## s of Govern## ment to make known , on 17 Dec## ember , the## ir support for the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations . 
the European Union should not fear Ankara , and Ankara should not fear Diyarbakir . 
Tur## key can act as a bridge between the EU and Islamic countries . 
Mr President , I want to make my point of order just as Mr Schu## lz ma## de hi## s . 
last month you re## fuse## d a point of order from me be## cause I di## d not mention the number of the Rule . 
on this occasion , Mr Schu## lz was allow## ed to make a point of order with## out mention## ing a Rule number . 
could you say what the rule## s are and why there is one rule for him and an## other for me ? 
I believ## e that you are in## vo## king Rule 14## 5 . 
I am mer## e## ly ask## ing why there is one rule for him and one rule for me . 
you we## re in the chair bo## th time## s . 
is it not time that you under## stood the Rule## s ? 
Mr K## nap## man , pleas## e behave proper## ly . 
if you wish to s## peak , pleas## e tell me which Rule you wish to invoke . 
if you tell me that you wish to s## peak on the bas## is of no particular Rule , you do not have the right to take the floor . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the next Council summit will focus on Tur## key , and I s## hall do the same in my speech , even though the French sovereign## ists , as I not## ed the day be## fore yesterday , have al## read## y ma## de known the reason## s for the## ir op## position . 
this time I would like to look at the issue from a different angle , and to warn the Council again## st the decision it is going to take . 
it is my belief that this decision will have extreme## ly serious con## sequenc## es , not mer## e## ly as a result of Tur## key &apos;## s ent## ry , but also in term## s of the European Union &apos;## s im## age a## mong## st the people## s of Europe . 
first## ly , the public is less and less s## ure of what we regard as our border## s . 
if Tur## key we## re allow## ed to join , the border## s would be blur## red , and the door would be open to a large number of Turk## ish @## -## @ s## peak## ing countries , including the countries of the Cau## cas## us s## uch as Georgia . 
in short , we are current## ly slip## ping in## to a kind of world state , the found## ation for which is mer## e## ly a hazy cata## logue of good intention## s label## led &apos; human right## s . &quot; 
this development is in## comprehens## ible to man## y European## s , all the more s## o be## cause - and this is my second point - we are at the same time turn## ing our back on what European## s see as the es## s## ence of Europe , and what ha## s be## en loose## ly , and per## hap## s clumsi## ly , describ## ed as it## s Christ## ian root## s . 
in spite of every## thing , there is a ver## y well @## -## @ define## d idea of the way of life and civil## isation## s of which Europe is ma## de up . 
we are mov## ing ever further away from these , and we no doubt do not realis## e the ex## tent to which we are insult## ing and shock## ing citizen## s , trap## ped as we are in the hu## s## tle and bust## le of the global## ised elit## e . 
my thir## d point is that the first con## sequenc## es will not be long in coming . 
the forth## coming refer## endum ha## s mean## t that the French people are begin## ning to see the link between Tur## key and the Constitution , and the## y will vot## e accord## ing## ly . 
I would there## fore like to remind the Council of the## ir respons## ibility for the out## come of the decision## s the## y take next Fri## day . 
. Mr President , no matter how much you try to dance a## round the issue , the subject of Tur## key is bound to be divisive . 
it is bound to creat## e the kind of tension## s and in## flame the pass## ions that we have seen not on## ly here this morning , but also in our debate yesterday . 
one of the most import## ant issue## s that we have to look at as a Parliament and as a Union is : what mess## age do we s## end if we re## fuse to open the door to negoti## ations with Tur## key at the week## end ? 
we set down certain rule## s and crite## ria which must be met by Tur## key be## fore negoti## ations can be allow## ed to begin . 
the Commission ha## s laid out a ver## y clear blue## print of how much ha## s be## en achiev## ed and what ha## s y## et to be done be## fore we reach the final hurdle . 
but we have also demand## ed that Tur## key should ful## fil it## s respons## ibil## ities and du## ties . 
there is , for in## stance , the question of the recogn## ition of Cyprus and the in## depend## ence and integ## rity of Cyprus . 
th## en there are certain human right## s issue## s that we## re mention## ed by Mr Coût## eaux , the pre## vi## ous speaker . 
it is interest## ing to hear a Kurd s## peak## ing about Tur## key be## ing part of the European Union . 
that is an import## ant mess## age that we should take acknowledg## e and follow . 
our voice , our mess## age , will determine whet## her or not the voice of moderate Mus## lim## s will be heard or whet## her we drive people back in## to a fundamental## ist respons## e and att## itude . 
that is why , if we oppose Tur## key coming in## to the European Union be## cause we are fear## ful of it## s impact on our econom## ies or it## s impact on the balance of power with## in the institution## s , we should say s## o clear## ly . 
we should not try to hide be## hind some false pretence that it is going to change the way Europe operate## s fore## ver . 
the European Union of today is a ver## y different anim## al from it## s 19## 73 incarnation . 
in## de## ed , one of the thing## s that is lack## ing in the European Union of today is the vision and inspir## ation of the found## ing father## s who ma## de the p## ho## en## ix of peace , prosper## ity and solid## arity rise from the ash## es . 
the respons## ibility of and on## us on this generation to extend a hand to other countries is as great today as it was in the 19## 40## s and 19## 50## s . 
in## de## ed , quit## e a few member## s of the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s wish to vot## e again## st the Eur## ling## s report be## cause the## y are square## ly oppose## d to Tur## key join## ing , but da## re to do s## o on## ly when the way the## y vot## e is conceal## ed from the general public . 
for fear of possible critic## ism , though , and of all the con## sequenc## es that this entail## s for the## ir care## ers in the## ir own countries , where the## ir govern## ments , haughti## ly laugh## ing off popular opinion , want to give Ankara the go @## -## @ a## head the day after tomor## row , the## y will not do s## o if the vot## e is public and not secret . 
the same may app## ly to quit## e a few Member## s of the Socialist Group . 
I would remind you of the valiant position## s take## n up in France on the Tur## key issue by Robert Bad## inter , Huber## t Véd## rine and the former Socialist Educ## ation Minister , Claude All## è## gre , all of whom have caution## ed us about the disastrous con## sequenc## es of Tur## key &apos;## s possible access## ion . 
it is indic## ative of the lack of democratic open## ness with which this issue ha## s be## en address## ed for year## s now . 
in Hel## s## ink## i , on## ly three minute## s we## re take## n to discuss the question as to whet## her Tur## key should obtain candid## ate status . 
that is what is report## ed by the former European Commission## er for the Inter## nal Market , Mr Bolk## e## stein , who was the on## ly person with the courage to tell Mr Pro## di that he re## fuse## d to approve the posit## ive Commission re## commend## ation of 6 October . 
three minute## s to decide whet## her we move the hot## bed## s of conflict in the Cau## cas## us and the Middle East to Europe &apos;## s bound## aries . 
three minute## s to decide whet## her tomor## row , we will again offer million## s of im## migrants the opportun## ity to flood our continent . 
three minute## s to decide whet## her we allow a country , where human right## s in general and women &apos;## s right## s in particular are violate## d on a large scale , ent## ry in## to our Union as a s## o @## -## @ call## ed model secular state and straight away give them the large## st number of vot## es in the Council . 
three minute## s to give the go @## -## @ a## head to a country that re## fuse## s to recognis## e an## other Member State and occupies part of that Member State with 30## .000 troop## s after having commit## ted un## told crime## s again## st human## ity . 
three minute## s to give the go @## -## @ a## head to a country where the state &apos;## s deni## al of the Armenian gen## ocide is organise## d by the Mini## s## try of Educ## ation , while no## body in Europe utter## s a word about this . 
I ask you , Europe , where are your grand principle## s ? 
Mr President , we are at an import## ant cross## road## s here in this House and the key issue these days - not on## ly in politic## s , but also a## mong the public - is , of course , the possible start of negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
as rapporteur , I should like to say , as I have s## aid be## fore , that my visit## s there have left me in two mind## s . 
on the one hand , there is a great deal of progress , and impress## ive progress too ; on the other , Tur## key is s## till trail## ing be## hind quit## e a bit if we we## re to compar## e that country with a country that re## ally want## s to become a Member of the European Union . 
that is why reform## s have to continu## e in the area## s of human right## s , women &apos;## s right## s and religious free## dom . 
I can## not emphasis## e en## ough that pressure in th## ose area## s must be simpl## y un## relent## ing . 
in## de## ed , the Turk## ish media and Turk## ish journal## ists urge us to use the s## tick and car## rot approach and keep up the pressure . 
human right## s have to be implement## ed more effective## ly . 
a s## witch in ment## ality is require## d in the area of religious minor## ities , s## o that people are proud of minor## ity religio## ns in## stead of try## ing to oppress them . 
in the field of , for ex## ample , the law on found## ations , further legal amend## ments must be table## d in order to offer s## cope to minor## ity religio## ns and minor## ity culture## s . 
that is why , quit## e apart from the whole core discuss## ion that ha## s be## en going on for month## s in this House and else## where , I should like to press home the fact that it would be good if an import## ant section of the report that is now be## fore us for final vot## e we## re also to be include## d in the Council &apos;## s conclusion## s . 
it concern## s the follow## ing . 
I s## hall read out a few sentenc## es in English , be## cause I have the English text in front of me . 
I think that this emphasis on the political crite## ria is necess## ary , be## cause not every## one in Tur## key realis## es that the reform## s will need to be car## ried out consist## ent## ly if the country re## ally want## s to qualify for member## ship of the European Union . 
I think that these further reform## s will determine whet## her or not Tur## key will be able to do this . 
I have an## other brief remark to make . 
if we discuss political crite## ria , th## en I would like to say that if I compar## e Tur## key to , for ex## ample , Roman## ia , and I consider the poor treat## ment in prison## s , the physic## al attack## s on investig## ative journal## ists and corrupt## ion , I take the view that the Council should s## end out a mess## age , and maxim## um pressure should be br## ought to bear in order to solv## e s## uch matter## s . 
in my view , th## ose practice## s are not in line with the political crite## ria which we uphold . 
my final remark concern## s terrorism . 
I am glad that the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council ha## s ma## de this a key issue . 
I am also glad that the N## ether## land## s - in the spirit of practi## s## ing what you preach - will now final## ly start ban## ning organisation## s that are on the European list of terrorist## s . 
I should like to ask the preside## ncy to convey to the other Member State## s that we should stand unit## ed in this . 
con## sequent## ly , to name but one concrete ex## ample , ET## A should be ban## ned in all countries , and not on## ly in Spa## in and France . 
can the preside## ncy guarantee now that with the exchange of inform## ation agree## ment , it will no long## er be possible for one country to hold inform## ation about attack## s in an## other country , with## out this inform## ation be## ing auto## matic## ally exchange## d ? 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I hope that Parliament will adopt the Eur## ling## s report on Tur## key in the version approve## d by the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s and I also hope it will do s## o by secret ballot . 
I believ## e that my fellow Member## s are wrong in think## ing that a secret ballot may favour a shift away from that position ; on the contr## ary , I expect that Member## s in this Chamber will demonst## rate that the## y are not subject to any pressure## s when free## ly carry## ing out the## ir mandate . 
as regard## s the remain## der of the foreign report## s , I agree with much of what Mr Nicolaï s## aid and I should like to express our agree## ment on all the measure## s that bring forward constitutional reform## s . 
in the High Representative &apos;## s action## s in Ukraine we have glimpse## d a sign that the initiative in that direct## ion is be## ing strength## ened . 
the initiative should , how## ever , be support## ed by more substanti## al instrument## s , which are foresee## n in the Constitution but which might per## hap## s be br## ought forward . 
with regard to the neighbour## hood policy , we encourag## e the Commission and the Council in the## ir work . 
we point out the danger , how## ever , that the measure## s to creat## e a free @## -## @ trade area may take precede## nce over the other poli## cies . 
I would stress that we do not just want to creat## e a free @## -## @ trade area , and s## o we should be care## ful not to weaken the policy &apos;## s regional and sub## regional dimension . 
as regard## s human right## s and demo## cracy , I re## commend that we negotiate a proper convention with our neighbour## ing countries . 
s## uch a convention should at last spell out the share## d value## s that we s## o often refer to and define them care## fully in formal term## s , particular## ly for the sake of the Medi## terranean countries . 
the convention should make th## ose value## s known to the people whom the## y concern and it should set up joint institution## s that can guarantee them . 
regard## ing the Middle East , we must ensu## re that the p## resident## ial elect## ions in Palestine give the road map a new boost and that the Israel## i Govern## ment &apos;## s unilateral decision## s , s## uch as the withdraw## al from Gaz## a , are include## d in the negoti## ations with the Quart## et , s## o that the creation of the Palestinian state can be complete## d with## in the establish## ed time frame . 
to that end , this issue will have to be plac## ed at the heart of the relation## ship between the European Union and the Unit## ed State## s . 
on the subject of Iraq , we consider that the hop## ed @## -## @ for turn## a## round ha## s fail## ed to material## ise even after the S## harm el @## -## @ Sheik## h conference and that the aim of holding elect## ions may well be jeopard## ised by the viol## ent situ## ation in the country . 
final## ly , I call on the Council and the Commission to devote attention also to the situ## ation in Cambodia , where there is a human## itarian emerge## ncy concern## ing child## ren . 
Mr President , the Dutch Presidency is near## ly at an end . 
in the first place , I should like to assess the ef## fort## s it ha## s ma## de to## ward## s re## duc## ing regulation at European level . 
the aim was to end the Bru## ssels bureau## cracy and to cut the number of regulation## s it produce## d by at least 25 % . 
need## less to say , we are far from reach## ing that per## cent## age , but the tone ha## s be## en set , and I regard that as a great bon## us in it## self . 
after all , if there are few## er rule## s and regulation## s , there is more room for entrepreneur## ship , be## cause it is the entrepreneur## s who have to save the European econom## y . 
I s## till think it desir## able , though , to appoint a European Commission## er to focus s## ole## ly on the elimi## nation of super## flu## ous and obsolete rule## s . 
a second topic address## ed d## uring the Dutch Presidency was the s## o @## -## @ call## ed Ha## gue decision## s about terrorism and combat## ing crime . 
the agree## ments reach## ed in The Ha## gue illust## rate that the European Union and the Council too - at long last - consider the fight again## st terrorism and crime as one of the## ir priorit## ies . 
at the same time , a balance ha## s be## en s## truck between an effective approach and extra legal s## cope on the one hand and the protection of personal data and fundamental free## dom## s on the other . 
after all , we are s## till be## ing put through our pace## s on that score , and I think that the Council ha## s done a reason## ably good job . 
the topic of human right## s ha## s not receiv## ed a great deal of attention , but sound work ha## s be## en done on it . 
I would particular## ly mention the protection of the defend## ers of human right## s . 
under the Dutch Presidency , the practical implement## ation of the EU direct## ive## s concern## ing human right## s defend## ers ha## s mov## ed one step close## r . 
a manu## al will be compile## d for the EU delegation## s a## cross the world ; it will provid## e for a prompt , flex## ible and consist## ent re## action from the EU when human right## s defend## ers are in peril of death or are at risk of abuse . 
I congratul## ate Mr Nicolaï on the inclus## ion in the age## nda of the need for good communic## ation about European integration . 
the public s## till consider## s Europe to be far re## mov## ed from the## ir own personal live## s and are far too read## y to turn the## ir back## s on it . 
it is on## ly by frequent communic## ation and a const## ant dia## logue with the citizen , not on## ly by the Member## s of this House , but also by the member## s of the Commission and the Council , that this gap can be bridge## d . 
I should like to finish off with a remark about the debate about standard## s and value## s with which this preside## ncy start## ed . 
as a Liberal , I feel hesit## ant about s## uch a debate , in general , and about the pur## e## ly Christ## ian nature that the Christ## ian Democrat## s tend to lend it , in particular . 
I also find it object## ion## able that the Left have d## evalu## ed the term## s &apos; standard## s &quot; and &apos; value## s . &quot; 
it is import## ant that this debate should have ma## de a start ; after all , it is a debate about what Europe is , where it should be head## ing , where our bound## aries are and what we are do## ing , or not , as the case may be . 
in short , it is a debate about where our found## ations lie . 
money is not , in## de## ed , the EU &apos;## s on## ly . 
I think that Mr Bal## k## enende &apos;## s article in of 7 Dec## ember was excel## lent ; one of hi## s conclusion## s was that the Union is about dynamic value## s . 
I see these as including respect , respons## ibility and con## fidence . 
we have in any e## vent ma## de a start on the discuss## ion and al## though the end is not in sight by a long way , this is s## till worth a compliment for this preside## ncy . 
on a final note , the preside## ncy ha## s definite## ly br## ought the European Union close## r to the Dutch people and even to member## s of the Dutch parliament . 
this , I know , is Mr Nicolaï &quot; s crusade , and it ha## s prov## ed ver## y success## ful ; as a Dutch MEP , I too am pleas## ed with it . 
Mr President , I should like to start with the financial perspective . 
at the summit , I hope that you will re## ally take the time to discuss at length the kind of Europe that you have in mind , be## fore you pass this subject back to the special## ist minister## s . 
some Member State## s want a small## er budget th## an the present one , which is just above 1 % . 
the Council prescribe## s that no cut## s must be ma## de in the agri## cultural budget , and it seem## s un## like## ly that any agree## ment will be reach## ed on cut## s in the structural fund## s . 
where do you think cut## s will be ma## de ? 
the## y will be ma## de in research and development , human right## s , the environment , external affair## s , youth exchange## s and culture - precise## ly th## ose area## s which are close to people &apos;## s heart## s and which vis## ibly add value at European level . 
a budget that is born of euro## sceptic## ism will on## ly breed more of it . 
with regard to terrorism , the draft conclusion## s of the forth## coming summit state that we , in our ef## fort## s to fight terrorism , must respect human right## s and fundamental free## dom## s . 
while agree## ing with th## ose conditio## ns , I fear that this may be no more th## an an in## cant## ation . 
I would refer to the discuss## ion about s## tor## ing communic## ations data of all tele## phone and Inter## net us## ers or the bio## metric data on pas## sports . 
the motto is : strict , strict## er , strict## est . 
it seem## s al## most in## appropriate to ask critical question## s about the effective## ness or the legitim## acy of measure## s again## st terrorism . 
like all arm## y general## s , th## ose fight## ing terrorism in Europe al## ways want the top gear . 
at least in defence purchase## s , politic## ians al## ways in## dependent## ly weigh up cost## s and benefit## s . 
where measure## s to fight terrorism are concern## ed , though , al## most no## body dar## es make this critical assess## ment . 
non## e## the## less , I would invit## e you to do just that at the forth## coming summit , be## cause at this rate , we will mess up our rule of law , and terrorist## s will have the## ir way after all . 
final## ly , I should like to make a brief comment about trans## par## ency . 
the Dutch Presidency ha## s pledge## d to try to emphasis## e the implement## ation of the clause in the Constitution on the bas## is of which the Member State## s will have public meet## ing## s hence## forth - after all , the## y we## re all agree## d on this when the Constitution was sign## ed - or at least hold more of them in public . 
I should like to ask Mr Nicolaï what he ha## s achiev## ed on that score . 
I hope that d## uring the Luxembourg Presidency , the door## s of the Council of Minister## s will be tru## ly open . 
we will th## en be able to see in all open## ness what is going on , and it will be possible for minister## s to be held respons## ible for the decision## s take## n , as we today are keen to be held respons## ible for the decision we are taking on Tur## key . 
- Lad## ies and gentle## men , the conclusion## s of the summit of the European Union to be held on 16 and 17 Dec## ember are s## o import## ant that the## y determine to a significant degree the physio## g## nomy of the European Union . 
enlarge## ment , with the possible open## ing of negoti## ations with Tur## key , require## s decision## s , the con## sequenc## es of which will be decisive . 
we must clar## ify from the out## set that we are not again## st Tur## key &apos;## s European prospect## s . 
we expect s## uch prospect## s to bind any country pursu## ing s## uch prospect## s with## in a mini## mum frame## work of oblig## ations pertain## ing to basic issue## s which app## ly to the other Member State## s , s## uch as fundamental free## dom## s , civil right## s and workers &apos; right## s , with## out of course harbour## ing any illusion## s . 
how## ever , these oblig## ations must be laid down from the out## set and be accept## ed by Tur## key . 
how could it ever be possible for a candid## ate country to be allow## ed not to recognis## e the exist## ence of an## other Member State and for this issue not to be clear## ly laid down at the summit ? 
how will this question be answer## ed if there is real equal## ity between the Member State## s or if , ultimate## ly , there are two set## s of standard## s and two yard## sticks ? 
it is , in my opinion , a not on## ly for there to be mutual recogn## ition but also for there to be normal## isation of relation## s between Cyprus and Tur## key , not on## ly be## cause the European Union and the principle## s which govern it## s operation s## o command , but also be## cause the Cyprus problem need## s to be resolv## ed in order for right to prevail for the benefit of our people , bo## th Greek Cypriot## s and Turk## ish Cypriot## s . 
no nation in the world want## s the illegal occupation of and hat## red and partition in the## ir country and this can## not be perpetu## ated . 
the European Union must open a window for the safeguard## ing of the basic principle## s of it## s ver## y exist## ence and call for the application of this mini## mum frame## work of oblig## ations and must also open a window for the simpl## e citizen## s by show## ing that it does not take decision## s us## ing two set## s of standard## s and two yard## sticks . 
to close , I wish to condemn the arrog## ant conduct of the Turk## ish leader## ship and it## s govern## ment when , in the statement## s it make## s , the impress## ion is give## n that it is the European Union which is ask## ing for Tur## key to join and not Tur## key which is ask## ing to join the European Union . 
Mr President , nothing could show Mr Barros## o &apos;## s contempt for this Parliament more th## an the fact that he could on## ly attend this debate for a few minute## s be## fore dis## appear## ing . 
on the subject of Ukraine , after the way in which he push## ed through the elect## ion of hi## s criminal## s and Commission## ers , let us stop pretend## ing that we can in any way lecture Ukraine on demo## cracy . 
with regard to Tur## key , we will not be support## ing it## s member## ship application , just as we di## d not in the last Parliament , on the ground## s of bo## th cost and like## ly migration pat## tern## s . 
had any## body in author## ity be## en here , I would have ask## ed for confirm## ation that the cost could be in the order of GBP 19 billion or EUR 28 million . 
this mean## s that Tur## key is cost## ing us as much as the ten countries that accede## d to this Union this year . 
could we pleas## e know what the cost will be , be## cause for the first time you are hear## ing from a nation that is actual## ly pay## ing for it . 
al## though the Lab## our Part## y in Brit## ain want## s to put GBP 5 billion to## ward## s it , the Con## serv## ative Part## y believ## es that GBP 5 billion is a good price to pay and believ## es you can s## till have tax cut## s . 
presum## ably it also think## s that pig## s can fly . 
can we actual## ly have confirm## ation of the cost of 19 billion ? 
also , will some EUR 700 million be spent on a## round 60 divers## e train## ing project## s in Tur## key ? 
is that the tru## e cost , or is there a more up @## -## @ to @## -## @ d## ate figure ? 
we know that Tur## key &apos;## s population grow## th rate remain## s phenomena## l and that it ha## s serious economic problem## s , including 70 per cent inflation . 
seven## ty per cent inflation d## uring the pass## age of the Maas## tri## cht Treat## y would have cause## d some ra## ising of eye## brow## s , but it is just a political project here , is it not ? 
e## special## ly for th## ose who do not pay . 
we also know that human right## s concern## s are wide## spread . 
on that bas## is I would say , on be## half of the UK In## depend## ence Part## y , that we will offer Tur## key friend## ship and free trade , but we will not offer the country political union - e## special## ly with the corrupt## ion and fraud that are end## emic in this place . 
we have often s## aid that Bulgaria and Roman## ia ought to join the Union , though we are particular## ly concern## ed about the area## s in which there is s## till a wide gap between the current situ## ation in th## ose two countries and the European average . 
in that respect we would point to the## ir legisl## ation on human right## s , social protection for workers and economic development , which should reach significant level## s by the end of the deca## de . 
al## though in principle we are in favour of start## ing negoti## ations with Tur## key - which , I stress , is a ver## y different thing from access## ion - we must not forget the need for it## s acknowledg## e## ment of the Armenian gen## ocide and for a last## ing solution to the Cyprus question . 
to some## body with any common sense , it is in## comprehens## ible that a country that aspi## re## s to join the Union should be militari## ly occupy## ing part of an## other country that is al## read## y a member . 
we are not at all worri## ed about the vot## ing system that we should use . 
I believ## e in the free## dom of all Member## s to make the## ir own decision## s , regard## less of whet## her the vot## e is open or in secret . 
I think this is just a formal## ity and certain## ly not a question of any sub## stance . 
the fight again## st terrorism is close## ly link## ed to the development of the Middle East peace process and the situ## ation in certain countries where conflict## s are not y## et over . 
I believ## e , how## ever , that the Union should maintain an ever strong## er pre## s## ence through it## s poli## cies and aid in th## ose part## s of the world that surround it and in which there are on## going , some## time## s tragi## c situ## ations of conflict . 
by do## ing s## o it can exert a stabilis## ing influence to support th## ose section## s of soci## ety that accept the value## s which character## ise our demo## cracy . 
Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , lad## ies and gentle## men , I hope that Mr Nicolaï will not leave the Chamber this time , as he di## d d## uring the last debate on the EU &apos;## s relation## s with Russia . 
Mr Barros## o , who ha## s al## read## y left , s## aid that the Dec## ember Council would be a great step to## ward## s the build## ing of a more prosper## ous Europe . 
judging from Mr Nicolaï &quot; s comment## s , how## ever , it is more like## ly to be a small and timid step , not a great one . 
I am not the on## ly one who feel## s that the Council is work## ing with## out any kind of serious vision and with## out any long @## -## @ term strate## gy , that it lurch## es from one e## vent to an## other , and that it mer## e## ly react## s to problem## s with## out any long @## -## @ term plan of how it should act to avoid them . 
this lack of strate## gy is a fundamental error , and it give## s rise to a great man## y problem## s . 
much is now be## ing s## aid by the Council on the subject of Ukraine , and man## y of it## s comment## s are entire## ly relev## ant . 
y## et if the Council had stated clear## ly a few month## s ago , as part of it## s futur## e strate## gy , that Ukraine would join the European Union , not today , not tomor## row and not the day after tomor## row , but may## be at the same time as Tur## key , th## en the current situ## ation in Ukraine would not have arise## n , as the Ukrainian Govern## ment would not have be## en able to afford to r## ig the elect## ions to s## uch an ex## tent . 
there is one thing I should like to thank the absent Mr Barros## o for , name## ly that he was in favour of a large## r budget for the European Union . 
an increas## e of EUR 1## 14 billion over seven year## s will promot## e the development of bo## th the EU and the new Member State## s . 
Mr President , the meet## ing of the European Council later this week is of histo## ric significance , prim## arily be## cause of the fundamental issue of the open## ing of negoti## ations with Tur## key on futur## e member## ship of the EU . 
there are ver## y strong## ly held view## s on this issue a## cross this Parliament and beyond . 
I acknowledg## e that . 
how## ever , the policy of my party is clear : we believ## e that in the right circum## stance## s Turk## ish member## ship of the Union could be good for Europe , good for Tur## key and good for relation## s with the Islamic world and securit## y in our soci## e## ties . 
I accept that the negoti## ations with Tur## key are like## ly to be length## y and at time## s difficult , but this week the Council should take a first step in that process . 
like any other appli## cant country , Tur## key must satisf## y all the crite## ria require## d in term## s of human right## s and economic and political reform . 
this might be ver## y difficult , but by agree## ing to the formal open## ing of negoti## ations the Council will s## end a clear mess## age to the Turk## ish Govern## ment that we expect it to work assidu## ously to achiev## e the step## s necess## ary for eventual member## ship . 
the issue of Bulgaria## n and Roman## ian member## ship of the Union will also feature on the age## nda and the object## ive there must be to affirm the access## ion of bo## th countries whi## lst recognis## ing that a great amount of work remain## s to be done - in particular in the case of Roman## ia - to ensu## re the## y remain on track . 
the issue of economic reform in the Union was discuss## ed at the last Council in N## ov## ember . 
how## ever , I hope that the N## ether## land## s preside## ncy and the head## s of govern## ment will re## affirm the## ir commit## ment to kick @## -## @ start## ing the Lisbon age## nda . 
ear## lier this week the Socialist Group express## ed concern at the neo @## -## @ liberal nature of the new Commission . 
I want to make it clear that we expect Mr Barros## o and hi## s team to be tru## e to the## ir ear## lier statement## s on the need to re## invigorate the econom## y in Europe and the crack @## -## @ down on red tape and regulation . 
the out## d## ated social model s## o bel## ov## ed of the left is to be replace## d with a vigorous , dynamic and radical reform programme . 
this is the on## ly way to deal with the high un## employ## ment and sluggish grow## th that ha## s led to Europe lagg## ing be## hind the Unit## ed State## s and the burg## eon## ing econom## ies of Chi## na and In## dia . 
if the Commission act## s in this way , it will get the full support of Brit## ish Con## serv## ative## s . 
Mr President , the next European Council is not just going to give it## s opinion on Tur## key and other issue## s , but also - as Mr Nicolaï ha## s mention## ed - on the broad guide## line## s for the next financial perspective## s . 
I would like to point out o## nce again that the financial perspective## s are an instrument of budget## ary disciplin## e and not an account## ing instrument , an instrument that fundamental## ly serve## s to provid## e st## ability and allow## s for reason## able medium @## -## @ term plan## ning of the Union &apos;## s poli## cies . 
this instrument is s## o import## ant that it appear## s as a law in the futur## e Constitution . 
the Commission yesterday and it## s President , Mr Barros## o , today , have confirm## ed that the## y fully accept the propos## al of the## ir predecessor . 
Mr Barros## o s## aid a moment ago that the Commission &apos;## s propos## al is a start## ing point for negoti## ations of the financial perspective## s . 
n## ever## the## less , I would call on the Commission to pursu## e this object## ive energ## etic## ally . 
in that way , that start## ing point could also become a finish## ing point and the Commission would there## by respond to that express## ion that we mention s## o often : we can## not creat## e more Europe with few## er resource## s . 
the Council and Parliament must also ful## fil the## ir respect## ive respons## ibil## ities and face up to the challenge## s confront## ing us . 
first## ly , economic and social cohes## ion is not just a principle enshrine## d in the Treat## ies and enhance## d in the futur## e Constitution , but also a necess## ary conditio## n for maintain## ing and protect## ing the European social model . 
second## ly , with regard to the enlarge## ment we have just car## ried out , we must not spare any ef## fort when it come## s to the new citizen## s of the Union . 
t## hirdly , f## ive year## s ago we set some ver## y ambitious object## ive## s . 
we are at the half## way point and we are ver## y far from achiev## ing , by 20## 10 , a competitive knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed soci## ety with full employ## ment , as we propos## ed in Lisbon and Gothenburg . 
four## th## ly , we are in the middle of the process of rat## ifying the European Constitution and the citizen## s some## time## s show even more enthusiasm th## an the## ir represent## ative## s . 
fac## ed with these challenge## s , we can## not be mis## er## ly to## ward## s our citizen## s . 
we would be making a great mistake if we we## re to try to in## corporate them in## to this project we call European integration - and every## thing it represent## s - while at the same time re## duc## ing the Union &apos;## s resource## s . 
we must continu## e to build a Europe with the necess## ary resource## s , with the resource## s laid down in the Treat## y , and use them efficient## ly . 
that would un## doubt## ed## ly be the best guarantee we can offer futur## e generation## s of a futur## e of peace , free## dom and prosper## ity . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , you have had a tough Presidency involv## ing man## y controversial issue## s , dramat## ic even## ts in the surround## ing world , the procedure surround## ing the Commission and , in particular , the internal political un## rest cause## d by the appal## ling murder of Theo van Go## gh . 
these factor## s must have affect## ed your ambit## ions and ef## fort## s when it came to securit## y and combat## ing terrorism . 
action plan## s and programme## s are fine , but li## ttle ha## s happen## ed s## o far . 
if the European Council can make progress at the Summit , all well and good . 
it must not be for## gotten that securit## y and the fight again## st terrorism must n## ever push a## side protection of individual priv## acy . 
we have debate## d most of the issue## s on the age## nda together in this House . 
you we## re here on Mon## day even## ing and listen## ed to the debate on Tur## key . 
in a few hour## s &quot; time , we are to vot## e on Mr Eur## ling## s &quot; report . 
I believ## e that a solid major## ity of MEP## s will vot## e in favour of giving Tur## key a d## ate . 
in that connect## ion , I wish to say how deplor## able it is that certain people in this House have push## ed through a policy that make## s the final vot## e secret . 
this Parliament is al## ways at the fore## front of open## ness and trans## par## ency , and the politic## ian who does not da## re to look hi## s or her elector## ate in the eye on this issue ha## s no place in this House . 
non## e## the## less , we expect you to have the courage to take this histo## ric decision and , not## with## standing all the difficult## ies , to give Tur## key a start## ing d## ate with a view to it## s obtain## ing full member## ship . 
on## ly in that way can the democratic process continu## e . 
this will also give a clear signal to the ten## s of thousand## s of Kurd## s in Diyarbakir who , at the week## end , demonst## rated in favour of EU member## ship for Tur## key . 
you mention## ed the European securit## y policy , together with dis## armament . 
I assume that you will be discuss## ing the agree## ment conclude## d by Iran with three of the Member State## s . 
it is , of course , extreme## ly posit## ive that Teheran intend## s to suspend it## s extract## ion of uran## ium . 
there are s## till , how## ever , consider## able doubt## s about what re## ally lies be## hind this decision . 
we should be ver## y vigil## ant be## fore making any concession## s to the Iran## ian regime , which must prove that it is serious and that it is not on## ly , as s## o often , play## ing a strategic game . 
the m## ullah## s in Teheran govern with an iron hand a country in which human right## s are complete## ly neglect## ed . 
there is no reason for reward## ing s## uch a country until we see practical improve## ments in this area . 
the Soci## al Democrat## ic Govern## ment in my country maintain## s - al## though it may be mistake## n , as it often is - that the issue of the embargo on arm## s sale## s to Chi## na will come up on Fri## day . 
if that is the case , I would remind you of the solid op## position in this House to lift## ing the embargo . 
this would s## end out complete## ly the wrong signal## s to the Chi## nes## e regime . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , certain speech## es on Ukraine - Mr Schu## lz &apos;## s in particular - have left me with a cur## ious impress## ion . 
after listen## ing to certain Member## s of this House over the past week## s , one could be forgiv## en for think## ing that the European Union took consist## ent step## s to establish , support and guide the demo## cracy move## ment in Ukraine . 
it would be a fine thing if this had be## en the case , y## et in actual fact it appear## ed on occasion as though the EU &apos;## s high represent## ative## s we## re al## most afraid of s## o much move## ment and s## o much live## ly and anim## ated demo## cracy , even d## uring the mass demonst## rations . 
I believ## e that less## ons must be learn## t from these experience## s in Ukraine , and not on## ly by the Member## s of this House , but also by the diploma## ts of the European Union and of the nation states . 
Europe &apos;## s securit## y is also dependent on the situ## ation in it## s neighbour## ing countries . 
this is some## thing I have heard ver## y frequent## ly in re## cent week## s , y## et it is not on## ly our securit## y and our well @## -## @ be## ing that is al## ways at s## take . 
if we are serious about the European value## s that we often invoke , the author## itarian and dictator## ial system## s a## round us must not be toler## ated or accept## ed , regard## less of our own interest## s . 
at a time of s## o man## y change## s for the better in Ukraine , which we may have help## ed a li## ttle to## ward## s the end , even though we di## d far too li## ttle , we must be aware how problematic is the situ## ation of the Belarus## s## ian people and the## ir free## dom , and we must also discuss Russia . 
it must not be s## aid that President Pu## tin and Russia are the same thing , as Russia ha## s the &apos; Mem## orial &quot; move## ment and a ver## y strong free## dom move## ment , and this is some## thing that must influence our diploma## tic relation## s with Russia and our policy to## ward## s it . 
- Mr President , a few days a## head of the abolition of the exist## ing quota## s on the international text## ile## s and cloth## ing trade , there is great concern over the futur## e of thousand## s of comp## an## ies and of more th## an 2.5 million workers concentr## ated main## ly in South## ern European countries . 
this sector ha## s al## read## y shed more th## an 1 million job## s in the last ten year## s . 
I regret that the debate we re## quest## ed on this extreme## ly import## ant issue ha## s not take## n place here in this House . 
it is cruc## ial not on## ly that we announce possible measure## s to prevent comp## an## ies from closing and million## s of workers from los## ing the## ir job## s , and to dis## pel the threat of p## over## ty and social exclus## ion that hang## s over large area## s in which these comp## an## ies are heav## ily concentr## ated , as is the case in Port## ugal ; it is also cruc## ial that s## uch measure## s be implement## ed . 
hence the question that I ask o## nce again : how will the impact of abolish## ing the quota system in th## ose countries with the great## est concentr## ation of the text## ile## s and cloth## ing indus## try be take## n in## to account s## o that un## employ## ment is prevent## ed from get## ting any wor## s## e and s## o that this extreme## ly import## ant indus## try is defend## ed ? 
I ask you , Commission## er , to ensu## re that this question reach## es the President of the Commission , who di## d not deign to hear our question . 
Mr President , the EU Constitution and Tur## key constitut## e a mis## match . 
common citizen## ship and vot## es accord## ing to population figure## s will destroy the EU and give rise to domin## ance by the big power## s . 
I want to see a Europe in which large and popu## lous nation## s are able to operate better in con## junction with small countries . 
I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put it## s name to a communic## ations strate## gy that will take money from opponent## s of the Constitution and make it avail## able for propag## anda on the part of adhere## nts of the Constitution . 
that is in conflict with the principle of equal## ity and is thu## s illegal . 
it is scandal## ous . 
the money us## ed for propag## anda is there for the purpose of sell## ing an un## democratic Constitution to the elector## ate . 
it would be easi## er to ensu## re that the demo## cracy we are los## ing in the Member State## s we## re at least combin## ed in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people . 
the EU Constitution make## s it in## cred## ibly difficult to amend the content## s of law## s . 
any change to one of the numer## ous poli## cies lock## ed in## to the Constitution must first be propos## ed by un## elect## able Commission## ers in Bru## ssels and th## en be bas## ed upon a qualified major## ity in the Council of Minister## s or , if appropriate , a un## anim## ous amend## ment to the Constitution . 
that is not demo## cracy . 
the un## democratic Constitution is , th## en , to be sold through an un## democratic distribut## ion of fund## s for the purpose of provid## ing inform## ation , s## o that people do not manage to discover that , cruc## ial## ly , the## y are los## ing what is at the ver## y heart of demo## cracy : the right to go to the poll## s and obtain a new major## ity and , sub## sequent## ly , a new policy . 
whet## her the solution to the democratic de## ficit is a federal bi## camera## l system or , alter## native## ly , our vision of a Europe of demo## cracies is some## thing that people should discuss and should decide in free and fair refer## endum## s in all the Member State## s . 
we right## ly demand that Ukraine hold free and fair elect## ions . 
should that not also app## ly to our## selves ? 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , Mr Barros## o , we all refer frequent## ly to a European ident## ity . 
Mr Barros## o , you in particular have spoken a great deal about it be## fore this House . 
it ha## s to be s## aid , how## ever , that a European ident## ity must be built first and fore## most on common securit## y and on the common economic area . 
there can be no question of a European ident## ity if solid## arity is lack## ing , and this lack manifest## s it## self every time financial decision## s are take## n . 
I would remind you that you refer## red to Parliament &apos;## s key role in the draw## ing up of financial perspective## s . 
I wonder what will become of financial solid## arity and the found## ation for the build## ing of a European ident## ity if Parliament &apos;## s propos## al is cut from EUR 111 billion to EUR 1## 06 billion ? 
if we wish to build a European ident## ity in the shape of a common area of securit## y or a common economic area , we must be clear where the bound## aries lie for EU enlarge## ment . 
give## n that Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion ha## s be## en propos## ed , and that some## one might well short## ly propos## e the access## ion of Moro## cco , whi## lst over## look## ing Ukraine , it is like## ly to become im## possible to s## peak of a European ident## ity , as there will be no s## uch ident## ity . 
Mr President , I wish to focus this debate on the on## going work of the Council to prepar## e and initiate the external relation## s service in advance of rat## ification and adopt## ion of the Constitution , for it is the Constitution which validate## s that service . 
I have in my possess## ion a letter from Mr## s Wall## s## tröm - the V## ice @## -## @ President of the Commission , who is present this morning - confirm## ing that the out## come of the debate on the Constitution should n## either be presum## ed nor pre @## -## @ empt## ed in any fashion . 
y## et that is precise## ly what is be## ing done in this on## going work on the new external relation## s service . 
that is wrong . 
as an individual Member of this House I protest again## st it . 
either we acknowledg## e and accept the right of the nation @## -## @ states to determine the f## ate of the Constitution , it## s new institution## s and it## s work## ing ap## para## tus## es s## uch as the foreign service , or we do not . 
bo## th the Council and the Commission arrog## ant## ly continu## e to work as if the Constitution was al## read## y approve## d . 
it is a grave insult to and assault on the right## s of nation## s and in## de## ed the right## s of people . 
Mr President , there can be no doubt that the Council summit of 17 Dec## ember will go down as a memor## able d## ate in the histo## ry of the construct## ion of Europe . 
I should , how## ever , like to tell the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council that our fellow citizen## s are concern## ed about these futur## e enlarge## ments , and above all about the continu## ing lack of respons## es to the cruc## ial question of where Europe &apos;## s border## s lie . 
we are of course in favour of Bulgaria &apos;## s and Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion to the EU , al## though these countries s## till need assist## ing in the## ir ef## fort## s , and we are also in favour of Croatia &apos;## s access## ion , as it will s## end a strong signal to the Balkan## s . 
y## et the situ## ation is entire## ly different with regard to Tur## key , a country which does not recognis## e the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it ha## s occupied for 30 year## s . 
Tur## key punish## es any## one who refer## s to the Armenian gen## ocide , and 97 % of it## s ter## rit## ory is out## side Europe , which mean## s that it ha## s no right to join the European Union . 
this is why we hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privilege## d partner## ship put forward by France . 
Tur## key &apos;## s integration in## to the EU would be tant## amount to reject## ing a political Europe straight## away , be## fore it ha## s even come in## to be## ing , and to perpetu## ating the im## age of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure . 
would this be a sens## ible course of action ? 
mov## ing on to an## other , equal## ly import## ant , issue , I welcome## d Mr Barros## o &apos;## s hard @## -## @ hit## ting remark## s on the EU &apos;## s Fina## ncial Perspective . 
n## ever## the## less , I remain concern## ed with regard to Europe &apos;## s futur## e . 
with## out the necess## ary resource## s , the EU can## not seek to strength## en social cohes## ion or to support competitive## ness , employ## ment , research and environment## al policy , and it will also be un## able to give due consider## ation to the age## ing of the population - in other word## s to adhere to the Lisbon strate## gy - or to continu## e the fight again## st terrorism , drug## s and crime . 
if we continu## e to operate with out## mod## ed budget## s , we will be un## able to confront the challenge## s which await us , for ex## ample the explosive grow## th in Chi## nes## e competit## ion . 
the Council should there## fore abandon it## s call## s for a European budget set at 1 % , as other## wise Europe will no long## er be able to guarantee the fund## ing of it## s regional policy , which is close to the heart## s of EU citizen## s . 
we expect the Council to take in## to account the priorit## ies I mention## ed pre## vi## ously , and th## en to allocate the resource## s necess## ary to achiev## e our go## al## s . 
we should not forget that Europe can## not be built with## out the contribut## ion of every individual and every European citizen . 
Europe should export it## s value## s to the rest of the world , but it should also respect the men and women who en## able it to exist . 
un## fortunate## ly , I fear that the decision## s take## n on 17 Dec## ember will be in## comprehens## ible to man## y of our fellow citizen## s . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , the Council is discuss## ing the access## ions of Croatia , Bulgaria , Roman## ia and Tur## key . 
I should like to encourag## e you , when deal## ing with Croatia , to take a tough stance where co## operation with the Inter## national Criminal Court is concern## ed , be## cause with## out that co## operation , it is ir## respons## ible to make a serious start with Croatia . 
per## sever## e ! 
with regard to Roman## ia , can you guarantee that we keep the require## ments for that country strict ? 
that is to say : no access## ion as long as Roman## ia does not meet the crite## ria in the area## s of human right## s and corrupt## ion , a## mong other## s , even if that mean## s that Roman## ia join## s the EU after Bulgaria . 
I will now turn to Tur## key . 
would I be quo## ting the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr Bal## k## enende , correct## ly if I s## aid : no second @## -## @ class status , s## uch as a privilege## d partner## ship , and no end d## ate ? 
is that s## till your position now ? 
are you also prepar## ed to say : no member## ship at the end of the negoti## ations if the human right## s viol## ations persist ? 
will you app## ly zero tolerance ? 
incident## ally , with regard to the secret ballot which we are threaten## ing to hold today about Tur## key , I am left with a feel## ing that this would be to deceiv## e the public . 
I hope we will not need to resort to that . 
over the past few month## s , you have held a debate about standard## s and value## s . 
should you not have ma## de this concrete by app## ly## ing it , for ex## ample , to an issue s## uch as Roman## ia or Tur## key , in the spirit of the French philosoph## er who s## aid : ? 
why not ? other## wise , it will remain a li## ttle theoretical . 
does the arm## s embargo again## st Chi## na not fit perfect## ly in the frame## work of the debate about standard## s and value## s ? 
this is not about Islam or Christ## ian## ity , but about the communal## ity of rule of law and demo## cracy , and in this great divers## ity , it is about the value## s we have enshrine## d in our new Constitution . 
I hope that that will remain the common denominator in the debate . 
I have s## aid to you be## fore that my impress## ion s## o far of the Dutch Presidency is that it## s ambit## ions and go## al## s are not as clear as the## y need to be . 
my question is whet## her that is a sign of in## securit## y or internal political contradict## ions with## in the Dutch Govern## ment , or are we s## till wait## ing for the big revel## ation ? 
in that respect , the Council ha## s quiet## ly saddle## d us with ver## y thorn## y issue## s on a few occasion## s . 
I will for a moment forget this meet## ing place , Strasbourg , but I would refer to the in## efficient Treat## y of N## ice and the agree## ments surround## ing agri## cultural spend## ing which we## re too expensive and produce## d too li## ttle change . 
your ambit## ions concern## ing Lisbon , Kyoto in Europe and the world are wonder## ful and we support you in them , but the financial resource## s you are setting a## side for them are piti## ful . 
this contradict## ion will , of course , not escape the public . 
terrorism is o## nce again the subject of live## ly debate## s at ver## y high level . 
on## ly last week , all European chief## s of police we## re gather## ed here , tell## ing us that , due to divers## e national practice## s , the f## actual exchange of inform## ation is s## till not get## ting off the ground as it should . 
there is s## till no person in charge at the heart of Euro## pol , terrorist## s are s## till slip## ping through the net of the law and there is no harmon## isation in the area of criminal investig## ation . 
the question remain## s : is Gijs de V## ries to keep coast## ing a## long , or will you allow him to do hi## s job proper## ly ? 
final## ly , I wish you much success with your position on Tur## key . 
the line I would take would be : no second @## -## @ class status and no alter## native## s ; we are read## y for real negoti## ations . 
I hope that with this , together with Mr Bal## k## enende , you will provid## e Mr Po## ette## ring &apos;## s group with an adequate respons## e . 
Mr President , I consider that Tur## key ha## s to begin making the necess## ary step## s to be accept## able to join the EU . 
for this purpose , certain conditio## ns must with## out fail be met , one of the most import## ant of which is the recogn## ition of Tur## key &apos;## s internal plural## ity . 
break## ing the fundamental Kemal## ist taboo is of vital import## ance . 
recognis## ing the linguist## ic , cultural and political right## s of Kurd## istan and other state## less national communit## ies is cruc## ial . 
logical## ly we European## s want Tur## key to comp## ly with all of that , but we wonder whet## her we should not start by recognis## ing our own intrinsic plural## ity . 
what about all the pluri @## -## @ national states that keep den## y## ing the## ir own divers## ity ? 
in the particular case of Spa## in - a state that in the## ory acknowledg## es it## s own domestic plural## ity , but not al## ways equal## ity a## mong all the different nation## s that make up that state - s## till more step## s have to be take## n . 
the Minister for Fo## reign Affair## s of the S## pan## ish Govern## ment , Mr Miguel Angel Mora## tinos , present## ed a memorandum on 13 Dec## ember on the official language## s of the autonomous communit## ies . 
s## uch a propos## al does not imp## ly , as we want## ed , full recogn## ition status for Cata## lan , Bas## que and Galicia## n . 
it does not give any recogn## ition to A## stu## rian or Ar## agon## ese . 
this memorandum offer## s the chance of s## peak## ing in the European Parliament in Cata## lan , but al## ways at 15 days &apos; notice . 
how can I hand## le this if I do not know until the day be## fore if I am to be give## n the chance to s## peak ? 
when your Member State## s &apos; govern## ments sincere## ly acknowledg## e the## ir plural## ity , that will be the most power## ful tool in work## ing to## ward## s a more democratic Tur## key , and in ask## ing for a fundamental change to the way in which it is app## ly## ing to join the European Union . 
Mr President , my party and my political group hope that the European Council will decide to embark upon negoti## ations with Tur## key concern## ing member## ship . 
it is just as import## ant to point out that Tur## key ha## s a ver## y long way to go , e## special## ly when it come## s to human right## s , the situ## ation regard## ing minor## ities , the Cyprus issue and union right## s . 
a great man## y legisl## ative change## s have occur## red in Tur## key , but it ha## s to be realis## ed that these are not match## ed by the re## ality on the ground and by change## s in practice . 
current Turk## ish legisl## ation too is ver## y defi## cient . 
I can point to the new criminal law that s## till in practice make## s it a criminal off## ence to mention the Armenian gen## ocide in Tur## key . 
that is complete## ly un## accept## able , and to Tur## key &apos;## s discredit that it continu## es to den## y this historical fact . 
recogn## ition of the gen## ocide would open the way to normal## isation for the Armenian## s in Tur## key and also to the normal## isation of relation## s with Arm## en## ia - some## thing that is necess## ary if Tur## key is to become a member of the EU . 
Mr President , frequent allusion## s are ma## de in this House to the continu## ing democrat## isation of Tur## key , and y## et we our## selves , who are suppose## d to vot## e on this issue , are taking our leave of demo## cracy and trans## par## ency . 
secret ballot## s are general## ly on## ly held in this House on matter## s re## l## ating to Member## s , and it is entire## ly in## comprehens## ible that s## uch a ballot should be held on import## ant political decision## s on matter## s of principle . 
who want## s to hide , and from whom ? 
are the## y hid## ing from the people of the Member State## s , the major## ity of whom - on the bas## is of rational argument - are oppose## d to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , or from the chair## men of the## ir group## s , out of fear of standing up for the## ir convict## ions , what## ever th## ose convict## ions may be ? 
this would mean that this House is mer## e## ly imit## ating the Council &apos;## s behaviour , and ultimate## ly we will fall host## age to th## ose who say that it is too late to say no . 
it is by no mean## s too late to do s## o . 
if Tur## key we## re to join the EU , Europe would fall in## to cha## os . 
this can be prevent## ed if we are open and trans## parent in cast## ing our &apos; no &quot; vot## es today . 
Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , the Dutch Presidency ha## s near## ly come to an end . 
it was , of course , not the easi## est of time## s to lead Europe , but we had no cho## ice . 
it al## read## y had a late start , follow## ing the re## cess ; th## en there was the handicap of a new## ly @## -## @ elect## ed Parliament that was start## ing to find it## s fee## t , and that was follow## ed by the Commission which came about in fit## s and start## s . 
under this not terr## ibly luck## y star , the N## ether## land## s s## till tri## ed to set to work . 
that is why I think that the N## ether## land## s should count it## s bless## ing## s , be## cause de## spite the short period of time , an awful lot go## t done , for ex## ample , with regard to the Ha## gue Pro## gramme for internal securit## y , the securit## y of our citizen## s . 
in that respect , Minister Don## ner , who is s## o often under fire in the N## ether## land## s , ha## s , together with hi## s colleague## s , done an excel## lent job . 
Mr Eur## ling## s ha## s al## read## y s## aid a few thing## s about Tur## key ; I do not propos## e to repeat them . 
some## thing I do have difficult## y with and which I think merit## s a comment is the accept## ance of Roman## ia and Bulgaria ac## ceding . 
I think that we need to let the Council , the summit , know that the matter , particular## ly in relation to Roman## ia , is certain## ly not done and dust## ed , be## cause in that country , human right## s , women &apos;## s right## s and child## ren &apos;## s right## s are s## till be## ing violate## d and corrupt## ion is s## till ramp## ant . 
in any e## vent , all thing## s be## ing equal , I do not think it is all that certain that Parliament will say &apos; y## es &quot; to it . 
with the same thing in mind , I should also like to make a remark about Croatia . 
it appear## s that there is much more reserv## e with regard to that country , and I would like to ask the Dutch Presidency whet## her that att## itude would not stifle any initiative## s . 
final## ly , I turn to the Lisbon age## nda , the ambit## ions of which should , of course , be measur## ed again## st the fund## ing that is be## ing set a## side for this purpose . 
in my view , at the summit , the 1 % club should in any e## vent ensu## re that the require## ments for Lisbon and the question as to how social cohes## ion can be best achiev## ed with the ten new Member State## s are examin## ed more effective## ly . 
ambit## ions and fund## ing should t## ally with e## ach other . 
Mr President , at the Council summit at the end of this week , the Dutch Presidency will present it## s conclusion## s on the European Union &apos;## s anti @## -## @ terrorist policy and anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy . 
it is imperative for the European Union &apos;## s anti @## -## @ terrorist policy to allow co## operation to be step## ped up effective## ly between Member State## s and with thir## d countries . 
in particular , we believ## e that Member State## s should enter in## to the necess## ary commit## ments with a view to implement## ing the action plan on the fight again## st terrorism , while s## tick## ing to the time## table for that action plan , and also enter in## to commit## ments with a view to elimi## nating the obstacle## s which certain national administ## rations are plac## ing in the way of exchange## s of inform## ation . 
we must also allow Euro## pol and Euro## just to provid## e European add## ed value in the fight again## st terrorism by plac## ing them at the centre of co## operation and exchange## s of inform## ation between Member State## s . 
we would how## ever note that the fight again## st terrorism should maintain a balance between necess## ary securit## y measure## s , on the one hand , and respect for fundamental right## s , on the other . 
a political agree## ment on the EU &apos;## s anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy ha## s al## read## y be## en reach## ed with## in the Council , and mer## e## ly need## s to be adopt## ed official## ly at the Council summit on 16 @## -## @ 17 Dec## ember . 
I believ## e it to be un## accept## able that the Council ha## s o## nce again fail## ed to wait for the European Parliament &apos;## s opinion , and that it re## fuse## d to inform the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s of progress ma## de in it## s own negoti## ations when the parliament## ary committee was discuss## ing the ver## y same issue . 
further## more , we hope that a fair## er approach will be adopt## ed to issue## s of asy## lum and im## migration , above all in order to ensu## re that the right## s of every individual are respect## ed and that respons## ibil## ities are share## d . 
final## ly , I should like to take this opportun## ity to express my regret at the fact that the Ha## gue programme ma## de no provision for measure## s to be take## n in in## stance## s where Member State## s do not trans## pose legisl## ation or instrument## s re## l## ating to justice and home affair## s . 
this is one of the short## coming## s of the most re## cent multi## annual programme . 
- Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Madam V## ice @## -## @ President of the Commission , I would like to start by congratul## ating the Dutch Presidency on it## s work . 
I have here the final draft of the conclusion## s and I must say that you have done a ver## y good job . 
with regard to enlarge## ment , I wish to start by high## light## ing posit## ive## ly the paragraph## s of the conclusion## s re## l## ating to the imminent access## ion of Roman## ia and Bulgaria and to emphasis## e that the access## ion of these two countries is creat## ing a new geo## political re## ality . 
con## sequent## ly , I consider it ver## y import## ant - as you mention in the conclusion## s - that the relev## ant agree## ments and treat## ies be sign## ed ear## ly on in 20## 05 . 
with regard to the case of Tur## key , a great deal ha## s of course be## en s## aid . 
I , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , will insist on keeping paragraph 20 of the draft conclusion## s which I have be## fore me , be## cause it deal## s with the question of the peace## ful re## solution of differ## ence## s with neighbour## ing countries . 
I would ask you to examin## e ver## y serious## ly the inclus## ion of a paragraph on Cyprus , by which I mean the withdraw## al of the Turk## ish force## s and , of course , recogn## ition of the Republic of Cyprus . 
I would also like to make a coup## le of posit## ive remark## s on what you have to say about the financial perspective## s . 
it is ver## y import## ant that we resolv## e the problem of the financial perspective## s be## cause , as you say , the financial perspective## s and how the## y are address## ed will give an enlarge## d Europe the tool to deal with futur## e challenge## s , and I welcome the fact that you are talk## ing of the need for prudence . 
to close , I think that a great deal ha## s be## en s## aid about terrorism , but I wish to draw the Presidency &apos;## s attention to the fact that the question of terrorism does not end with a few paragraph## s . 
it is a complic## ated issue , a ver## y serious issue . 
it is here to stay , we s## hall face new challenge## s every time and the Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission will there## fore need to co## operate close## ly in order to combat this phenomenon . 
Mr President , this ha## s be## en a difficult year . 
it start## ed for me with a letter bomb ex## plod## ing in my office . 
since th## en we have had the Madrid bomb## ing## s . 
I would hope that at this time of the year our thought## s are with the victim## s and the## ir fami## lies . 
out## side the European Union there was the trage## dy of Beslan , and th## en today &apos;## s bus siege in Greece . 
all this reinforce## s the fact that the securit## y of our citizen## s ha## s to be an absolut## e priorit## y for the EU but , as a number of colleague## s have al## read## y point## ed out , that need## s real action . 
far too often co## operation a## mong our police , judicial and intellig## ence service## s is co## operation in name on## ly . 
even a short convers## ation with any## body who work## s for Euro## pol would reinforce that . 
Member State## s have to deliver on the## ir promise## s . 
we need action , not word## s . 
the same appli## es to the economic age## nda . 
Member State## s have to be call## ed to account by the preside## ncy for the thing## s the## y have promise## d to do . 
in particular , we have to get much more invest## ment in## to people . 
we particular## ly need to deliver on the active labour market poli## cies that Mr W## im Kok ha## s report## ed on in the past . 
too man## y people in the European Union are in## active . 
we are far too prepar## ed to pay people to be on the scrap heap . 
we need much more pro## active poli## cies to make work pay , and that include## s more child## care and more educ## ation and train## ing . 
we can## not simpl## y write people off as be## ing un## employ## able . 
sound finance## s are the bas## is of a good econom## y and there## fore we are right to review the budget . 
as my colleague Mr## s Dührk## op Dührk## op s## aid , it must not be some sort of mathematic## al exerc## ise . 
we have to look at what we do . 
what is the add## ed value in do## ing some## thing at European level ? 
what is the best way of get## ting value for money for our citizen## s ? 
at the same time , we al## ways have to re## member that solid## arity is the corner## stone of the European Union . 
you re## move that corner## stone and you under## mine the ver## y found## ations of the Union . 
that is why this debate on finance## s is vital to the futur## e of the European Union . 
I would like to comment on the access## ion process of two neighbour## ing countries . 
in the case of Croatia , we have a well @## -## @ prepar## ed nation and country with European tradition## s work## ing to## ward admiss## ion to the European Union . 
as Croatia## ns live## d under the same form of govern## ment as Hung## arian## s for over 8## 00 year## s , 4## 00 year## s of which as part of the Habs## burg Mona## rchy , the## ir commit## ment to the legal system , and the## ir social and economic organisation is ver## y similar to th## ose of Hung## ary . 
I w## ent to Za## gre## b sever## al time## s in the 19## 90## s , I have also visit## ed it late## ly , and conclude## d that bas## ed on the## ir institutional prepar## ation on the level## s of govern## ment , econom## y and parliament , the## ir hope## s for negoti## ations are as just## ified as Hung## ary &apos;## s we## re at the begin## ning of negoti## ations in 19## 98 . 
Croatia &apos;## s economic and social prepar## ed## ness also make## s it possible for the negoti## ations for access## ion not on## ly to be open## ed in the spring of 20## 05 , but also to be conclude## d , regard## less of other factor## s and other countries , s## uch as Tur## key . 
this may also serve as a posit## ive mess## age to other nation## s and govern## ments of the West Balkan## s who are head## ed to## ward## s Europe . 
Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion will be a major step in the evolution of Europe , as a European nation compose## d of vari## ous European people## s , including two million Hung## arian## s , will join . 
it will be a win @## -## @ win situ## ation for bo## th foreign policy and the internal market . 
be## ing accept## ed by Europe will hope## fully help Roman## ians not on## ly to discover the advantage## s of the## ir divers## ity but also to pre## serve them , contr## ary to the## ir current poli## cies . 
the pre## serv## ation of European solid## arity also include## s pay## ing attention to the impact that the expansion ha## s on th## ose Member State## s that com## prise the border## s of the European Union , s## uch as Austria was this year . 
a monitor## ing system oper## ating on a more regular bas## is , that is bi## annual## ly , need## s to be establish## ed to ensu## re that commit## ments are follow## ed through . 
in the case of Roman## ia , the function## ing of the communit## y system is of key import## ance , and in order to prove this , it is en## ough to consider environment## al protection , the policy of competit## ion or area## s ma## de vulner## able by internal consider## ations s## uch as anim## al health , custom## s , or exc## ise tax . 
if screen## ing , that involve## s the European Parliament , reveal## s de## ficit## s in these field## s a few year## s be## fore and after access## ion , th## en EU resource## s must be mobilise## d for the necess## ary institutional development even at the cost of other go## al## s . 
should this fail as well , th## en - let us face it - specific sanction## s will have to be appli## ed . 
as Bulgaria ( which ha## s show## n prom## ising progress ) and Roman## ia should be subject to individual consider## ation , I believ## e it is necess## ary to separat## e the## ir access## ion process## es and if necess## ary , to stipul## ate a flex## ible access## ion d## ate to Roman## ia , who## s## e member## ship I ver## y much look forward to . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , as rapporteur for Croatia I should like to say a few word## s today on a country to which li## ttle reference ha## s be## en ma## de , even though it is to be hop## ed that the European Council summit will see a posit## ive and import## ant decision take## n on it . 
al## though it is a fact that every rapporteur treat## s the country for which he is respons## ible a li## ttle like hi## s or her own child , I do believ## e that this is not mer## e## ly a matter of taking a decision on Croatia , but of taking a decision on a whole region . 
particular## ly give## n the st## ability and securit## y concern## s that have al## read## y be## en touch## ed upon , it is vital that the Council &apos;## s decision on it should be favour## able . 
this would be a sign that every country in the Balkan## s , if it make## s the appropriate ef## fort## s and meet## s the crite## ria , ha## s a chance of be## coming a Member State of the European Union , some## thing that was re## cent## ly promise## d in Thessa## loniki . 
I believ## e that bo## th the former and the present Croatia## n Govern## ments , with the## ir differ## ing political orient## ations , have done a great deal to prepar## e them## selves and to move to## ward## s meet## ing the crite## ria to which we must pay close attention in every in## stance . 
there is how## ever an obstacle that is un## doubt## ed## ly of great significance , name## ly co## operation with the Inter## national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslav## ia in The Ha## gue . 
it is claim## ed that there is s## uch co## operation , but it ha## s be## en n## either full nor adequate . 
demand## s have be## en ma## de , and right## ly s## o , that close attention be paid to whet## her every country - bo## th Croatia and the other countries , above all Serb## ia - co## operate## s with The Ha## gue in this respect . 
y## et I believ## e that in principle , and as a matter of priorit## y , the Council should acknowledg## e the posit## ive step## s under## take## n by Croatia , and that this should also be reflect## ed in the Council &apos;## s decision . 
I also hope that the Govern## ment will not mer## e## ly issue decla## rations , but will genuine## ly take every possible measure to bring the indict## ed general Ante Got## ov## ina be## fore the Tribunal in The Ha## gue . 
in add## ition to taking s## uch measure## s , it should also destroy the network## s that per## hap## s s## till exist and support him , and it should ensu## re that the## y are genuine## ly destroy## ed . 
final## ly , Mr President , I believ## e that Ante Got## ov## ina , if he is the patriot he claim## s to be , should not take hi## s country host## age . 
he must give him## self up to the Tribunal in The Ha## gue , as it would be a real shame if the f## ate of a country as import## ant as Croatia we## re to depend on the decision of a s## ing## le man not to surrender to justice . 
I there## fore hope that , in view of all these circum## stance## s , a posit## ive sign will be give## n to The Ha## gue . 
- Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I feel that every## one - citizen## s and politic## ians a## like - is liv## ing through an histo## ric er## a , be## cause the decision which the European Council is expect## ed to take on access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key will be a land## mark for Tur## key it## self , the European Union and our region as a whole . 
public opinion ha## s not concern## ed it## self to s## uch an ex## tent with any other candid## acy . 
there we## re no s## uch differ## ence## s between the Member State## s or between the political part## ies , no s## uch pressure was br## ought to bear by the Unit## ed State## s , no s## uch concern## s or fear## s we## re express## ed , no s## uch varie## ty of question## s was ra## ised s## o serious## ly at every discuss## ion table . 
the European Parliament is having trouble find## ing it## s political direct## ion on this issue , not be## cause of any weak## ness on it## s part , but be## cause of the complex## ity and serious## ness of the issue . 
argument## s have be## en express## ed for and again## st the access## ion of Tur## key to satu## ration point over re## cent days . 
we have one common denominator : we are call## ing on the European Council to defend the dign## ity of the European Union ; to respect Tur## key , but also to respect the value## s which un## ite the people## s of Europe . 
no can be us## ed as an alibi for setting a## side our value## s or for adjust## ing them to Turk## ish demand## s , be it in connect## ion with the spirit or the letter of the C## open## hagen crite## ria or with the recogn## ition of all 25 Member State## s of the European Union , by which you will understand that I mean the recogn## ition of the Republic of Cyprus . 
this is not on## ly a moral cho## ice , but also the best bas## is for a sustain## able policy which will safeguard our cohes## ion and will inspir## e respect for and con## fidence in the Union in it## s citizen## s who , in all even## ts , expect clear just## ification for the decision## s of the European Council and a public dia## logue which , un## fortunate## ly , ha## s not y## et take## n place , with sub## stance and depth on the futur## e of euro @## -## @ Turk## ish relation## s . 
the other issue I want## ed to mention is that the Council should , at long last , draw up a long @## -## @ term plan for our foreign relation## s with decisive## ness , cohes## ion , proper## ly co## ordinate## d object## ive## s and reli## able financ## ing . 
in particular , I want to refer to our relation## s with the countries of the Balkan## s and our partner Medi## terranean countries which make up our liv## ing space . 
this frame## work include## s the role which we need to play in the re## solution of the Middle East cris## is , in this new er## a which is at long last now start## ing for the region ; it would appear that the go## al post## s are shift## ing and that there are margin## s for intervention and change . 
Mr President , Hung## arian citizen## s vot## ed for member## ship of the European Union with an overwhelm## ing major## ity of 83 per cent . 
the## y di## d s## o in the belief that after man## y lo## st deca## de## s Hung## arian soci## ety could become a part of the common European social model , including strong social poli## cies for every## body , real improve## ments in environment## al matter## s , free move## ment of labour and solid## arity for common standard## s a## mong the 25 nation## s . 
that is the go## al of this huge European project . 
be## side## s a per## man## ent and al## most end## less enlarge## ment , we should not forget the origin## al idea of deepen## ing the exist## ing Union by the approx## im## ation and harmon## isation of our standard## s of liv## ing , infra## structure and labour market . 
if we are deep## ly concern## ed about the age## ing population and the lack of labour force## s , why do some Member State## s close the## ir labour market even to the s## kill## ed workers of other EU Member State## s ? 
the new financial frame## work does not seem to answer some of the basic question## s - at least as far as I am concern## ed . 
is 1.2## 4 per cent of the G## NI of our Member State## s en## ough to establish a common social model for us ? 
is it en## ough to cover the expense## s of the brave environment## al initiative Natura 20## 00 , design## ed to save our nature and bio## divers## ity ? 
if we are s## o proud of our cultural value## s , as ha## s be## en mention## ed in this debate , why do we spend on## ly one per cent of our budget on culture , educ## ation , etc . ? 
if 1.2## 4 per cent of G## NI is s## uch a low amount to build up a common European social , environment## al and cultural model , why are some Member State## s even consider## ing re## duc## ing this amount ? 
final## ly , does the Council believ## e in a strong social and cultural union and is it read## y to provid## e the basic financial source## s to creat## e it ? 
Mr President , the debate on the Fina## ncial Perspective involve## s man## y different issue## s . 
the debate on how large the EU &apos;## s in## come should be should n## ever conceal the import## ance of how we priorit## ise our expend## iture . 
we must give great## er priorit## y to the expend## iture support## ing the development of the new knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed soci## ety and da## re to provid## e small## er subsid## ies to th## ose part## s of our econom## y that are too large and that belong to the econom## y of a different er## a . 
the Lisbon process will of course be the most import## ant element . 
what the Commission and the Council must do is not just talk about lofty go## al## s but also propos## e practical measure## s that increas## e competit## ion , e## special## ly with## in th## ose sector## s associate## d with the knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed soci## ety . 
what is at issue is how we are to extend competit## ion with## in the field## s not on## ly of educ## ation and health care but also of other area## s of our soci## ety s## o that , in Europe , we might obtain the best business## es . 
there is one issue that make## s the summit we are now fac## ing e## special## ly histo## ric , and that is the issue of Tur## key . 
a &apos; no &quot; decision , or a mean## s of delay## ing the member## ship process , would of course have con## sequenc## es of vari## ous kind## s . 
we should in that case be leav## ing the field free for force## s and ideal## s other th## an th## ose for which the EU stand## s . 
the EU &apos;## s basic task is to creat## e safety and securit## y and to bridge differ## ence## s in## stead of creat## ing new line## s of demarc## ation . 
this mean## s that we must ask our## selves the question : will we enjoy great## er safety and securit## y with Tur## key root## ed firm## ly in the fundamental value## s of the EU and of Europe , just as we are that much safe## r and more secure as a result of the enlarge## ment that ha## s take## n place this year and just as we s## hall also be safe## r and more secure if the EU can be extend## ed to the Balkan## s ? 
that issue is ultimate## ly about the respect we perceiv## e for the work done by the EU . 
the reason why other countries want to join the EU is the EU &apos;## s success in increas## ing safety and securit## y . 
this is an import## ant reason why the Council must take the histo## ric decision to agree to comm## enc## ing negoti## ations . 
in my brief contribut## ion , I s## hall deal with just one topic and that is the topic of enlarge## ment . 
we have be## en witness## es to an unprecedented historical enlarge## ment with ten new countries . 
I my## self come from one of the new countries and I think we can all agree that , after just the first seven month## s , we can say that enlarge## ment ha## s be## en a success . 
it ha## s be## en a success for Europe , for the &apos; old Member State## s &quot; and for the new countries . 
the process of the histo## ric enlarge## ment of Europe is not complete , how## ever . 
we have talk## ed in this House and we s## hall talk again this afternoon about Roman## ia and about Bulgaria . 
I am convince## d that bo## th Bulgaria and Roman## ia are well on the way to join## ing the European Union and I believ## e that , with the European Union &apos;## s help , the## y will be able to make a success## ful access## ion in## to our Comm## un## ity in 20## 07 . 
we are also going to talk about Croatia . Croatia definite## ly play## s a key role in the Western Balkan## s . 
I should like the Council to give a clear signal to Croatia that access## ion talk## s should begin with that country , provid## ed , of course , that the appropriate C## open## hagen crite## ria and the require## ments of the Inter## national Criminal Court in The Ha## gue have be## en met . 
Croatia can , I believ## e , play a significant role in the Western Balkan## s and could be a futur## e model for Serb## ia , Bosnia , Monte## negro , Macedonia and the other countries of the Western Balkan## s . 
we s## poke here yesterday , and we s## hall again today , about Tur## key . 
I should like the Council to re## member it## s oblig## ations , to re## member Europe &apos;## s promise## s and to begin access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
give## n that we have a## ward## ed that country the status of candid## ate country , I feel that we owe it to Tur## key to open negoti## ations . 
this will also support the process of reform there , which ha## s be## en pursu## ed success## fully for the last two year## s . 
- Mr President , there is some## thing of which I would like to remind , our assemble## d Head## s of State or Govern## ment , and that is that the## y are elect## ed by the people . 
the## y we## re elect## ed to represent , in a European con## text , the interest## s of the## ir people , and thu## s of the## ir nation states . 
the## y are on## ly the first a## mong equal## s , no more th## an that , and the## y bear a tremend## ous respons## ibility for our common futur## e . 
one would normal## ly assume that these ver## y Head## s of State or Govern## ment represent the will of the people , but , right now , that clear## ly seem## s not to be the case where exist## ent## ial question## s are concern## ed . 
let us take my own country , the Fede## ral Republic of Germa## ny , as an ex## ample . 
there ha## s be## en a new survey on the issue of Tur## key . 
on## ly 15 % of Germa## ns are in favour of Tur## key gain## ing full member## ship of the European Union , 60 % of Germa## ns support that special form of co## operation that we call a privilege## d partner## ship , 22 % are general## ly again## st co## operation between Tur## key and the European Union and on## ly 3 % express## ed no opinion . 
in spite of this , what our Chance## ll## or put to the Council was hi## s own party @## -## @ political opinion . 
he is the strong## est support## er of Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , of this great mad## ness . 
is that right ? 
is it respons## ible ? 
no , it is not . 
we see exact## ly the same situ## ation in other Member State## s . 
the Council must be aware that the decision now to be take## n regard## ing the start of access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key is not just about the further enlarge## ment of the EU . 
it is an exist## ent## ial question for the European Union , for the political Union which is of the ut## most import## ance for us and for the pre## serv## ation of peace in the futur## e . 
after all , our histo## ry reflect## s the histo## ry of Europe , and show## s how difficult it is to get a## long with all these small , head## strong European nation## s . 
histo## ry also show## s us that if we expand too much now , as di## d s## o man## y other former empire## s which grew too fast , there is the danger of our over## reach## ing our## selves and bring## ing about our own down## fall and ruin## ation . 
if our own Head## s of State or Govern## ment now give Tur## key a start## ing d## ate for negoti## ations , even though the crite## ria have not be## en met , and even though we know that we can## not manage to integrate this enormous country , the## y will be gam## bl## ing away our futur## e . 
how## ever harsh this might sound , Tur## key is too big , too hetero## gene## ous , too poor , and too popu## lous . 
we must not take that step . 
we have expand## ed much in the past year and three more countries are y## et to join us . 
we have to consolidate our position first . 
we have to get to grip## s with e## ach other and it is the ex## ample of Germa## n re## un## ification that show## s us how difficult that task is . 
we have not manage## d it y## et . 
I appeal to our Head## s of State or Govern## ment to be aware that the## y represent the will of the people , that the## y have to convey the will of the people to the out## side world , and that the major## ity of the people of Europe , I am quit## e convince## d , think : &apos; pleas## e be care## ful in making promise## s to Tur## key . 
we can## not afford it ! &quot; 
- Mr President , I di## d not actual## ly want to s## peak about Tur## key y## et again , for every## thing that there is to say about it ha## s al## read## y be## en s## aid , but Mr## s Somme## r ha## s prompt## ed me to s## peak . 
every## one present## s survey## s that serve the## ir purpose . 
I know of survey## s car## ried out in Germa## ny which show that people have nothing again## st Tur## key be## coming a member of the EU . 
I can on## ly say that I would warn people again## st over @## -## @ dramat## ising and exagger## ating the situ## ation , as you have just done . 
it is complete## ly mistake## n and in## appropriate to tie Europe &apos;## s exist## ence and the surviv## al of the European Union to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion . 
let ten year## s pass and wait until the negoti## ations are over , and may## be th## en Tur## key will become the thir## tieth member of a great Union with 500 million inhabit## ants . 
s## o pleas## e let us remain calm ; let us keep a cool head and let there be less drama and e## motion in this debate . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , I too actual## ly want## ed to talk about an enlarge## d Europe . 
I want## ed to congratul## ate you on holding a s## eries of conference## s on European ident## ity . 
that was a ver## y good and necess## ary thing to do . 
we have to ask our## selves what it is that hold## s 4## 50 million European## s together , what it is that un## ites us all , from Estonia to Port## ugal , from Scot## land to Greece , and , as we all know , the answer is : European value## s . 
it is also the posit## ive object## ive## s the European Union ha## s set it## self : the commit## ment to peace , to free## dom and to justice . 
these are the thing## s that un## ite us in Europe . 
over the next two year## s in particular , d## uring the process of rat## ifying the Constitution , it is e## special## ly import## ant to convey these thing## s and not to lose our## selves in point## s of detail . 
I am there## fore e## special## ly glad that , at the summit on Fri## day , under Point## s 66 and 67 of the Conclusion## s , you ask## ed the Commission to put these matter## s at the fore## front of it## s communic## ation strate## gy . 
I think that we can win the people over in this way - Commission## er Wall## s## tröm is also do## ing good work in this regard - and s## o I would like to encourag## e you to decide in favour of this , as it is in## de## ed necess## ary . 
in this con## text , I also think that Point## s 69 and 52 , in which we affirm human right## s , are ver## y posit## ive . 
as it ha## s al## read## y be## en agree## d that there should be a European Human Right## s Ag## ency , it must now be set up . 
Europe need## s this instrument , and our value## s are import## ant not on## ly for our ident## ity with## in the Union , but also for our author## ity in the world at large . 
I there## fore wish not on## ly to congratul## ate you , but also to encourag## e you to push forward with these issue## s . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the debate on Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union , which ha## s last## ed for sever## al month## s , will short## ly come to an end . 
I should like to congratul## ate all the Member## s of this House , my## self include## d , on the wide @## -## @ rang## ing nature of the debate , and to express the hope that every other import## ant decision will be precede## d by a debate of s## uch calib## re . 
d## uring this debate , no few## er th## an four model position## s on Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union emerge## d . 
the first is the tradition## al position , name## ly that negoti## ations should be open## ed , in all like## lihood as ear## ly as next year , with the possibil## ity of suspend## ing them if it be## came ap## parent that problem## s or obstacle## s we## re be## ing creat## ed by the Turk## ish side . 
the second position is that of open## ing negoti## ations with the possibil## ity of offer## ing Tur## key an alter## native solution if s## uch difficult## ies a## rose d## uring these negoti## ations , name## ly a special , privilege## d partner## ship . 
the thir## d position consist## s of wait## ing until Tur## key meet## s the C## open## hagen crite## ria in full , which amount## s to im## posing additional conditio## ns give## n that the C## open## hagen crite## ria have not be## en fully met . 
final## ly , the four## th position is that of a special , privilege## d partner## ship . 
I understand that Parliament &apos;## s decision is to adopt the first model , or in other word## s to start negoti## ations next year with## out any other additional conditio## ns , and I also understand that this is like## ly to be the Council &apos;## s decision too . 
it will be a decision of ground @## -## @ break## ing import## ance , and a decision im## posing a great respons## ibility on the Member State## s , the EU and the Council . 
it will mean taking the first step## s a## long a ver## y demand## ing path . 
conditio## ns are set not on## ly for the Turk## ish side , but also for the Member State## s , the Commission , the Council and Parliament . 
these conditio## ns are all the more cha## lleng## ing , and this respons## ibility is all the more difficult to bear , be## cause we are , s## o to s## peak , deal## ing with a child . 
reference## s have al## read## y be## en ma## de to a marriage , but I prefer to use the ex## ample of a fami## ly with an adopt## ed child . 
in a certain sense , Tur## key is an adopt## ed child , and we should not forget that the respons## ibil## ities of the fami## ly and of the parent## s are particular## ly cha## lleng## ing when adopt## ing a child . 
I hope we are all fully aware of this , and that we will begin to put our European house in order . 
- Mr President , of the vari## ous topic## s for debate at the forth## coming European Council - in add## ition to Tur## key , which we have spoken about on a number of occasion## s - the topic of the fight again## st terrorism remain## s extreme## ly import## ant . 
the Dutch Presidency &apos;## s evalu## ation of the action programme of Ju## ne 20## 04 is proof of this . 
give## n that this is a threat to all of us , the most appropriate strate## gy is one that lead## s us to act together , bypass## ing national level and even the area## s of internal justice and securit## y . 
in## de## ed , the way to deal with terrorism today is entire## ly different from the 19## 70## s and 80## s . 
the even## ts of 11 Sept## ember 20## 01 have usher## ed in a radical change in the area of securit## y . 
European countries have new respons## ibil## ities and new challenge## s , the urge## ncy and serious## ness of which was confirm## ed by 11 Mar## ch . 
in a global## ised world , politic## s , diploma## cy , internal securit## y and defence must be combin## ed to address these new type## s of threat . 
securit## y ha## s become a global , indi## visible con## cept , which today encompass## es internal and external securit## y and the support of thir## d countries in the fight again## st terrorism . 
the EU and it## s Member State## s must stream## line the## ir defence capacities and strength## en the## ir channel## s of diploma## tic co## operation , the## ir inform## ation service## s and the## ir legal and law enforce## ment co## ordination , in a genuine synerg## y of national and trans## national policy . 
as a Port## uguese Member of this House , I wish to point out that my govern## ment - under the th## en Pr## ime Minister , Mr Dur## ão Barros## o , who is now President of the Commission - trans## posed all Comm## un## ity legisl## ation in the area of combat## ing terrorism and took the operation## al measure## s need## ed to carry this out . 
on the same subject , I should like to high## light the introdu## ction of bio## metric data in pas## sports , a measure that was on## ly re## cent## ly adopt## ed by Parliament . 
provid## ed it is accompani## ed by essential pre## caution## s , this measure will serve to strength## en crime prevent## ion and , in turn , to reinforce the citizen## s &quot; securit## y , which is our prim## ary object## ive . 
on the e## ve of the European Council , the vari## ous speech## es ma## de in this House on this subject have show## n that Parliament wish## es to s## end out a clear mess## age that this is the path that together we must relent## less## ly continu## e to follow . 
as a represent## ative of Estonia , her## self the product of the re## cent enlarge## ment , I welcome the conclusion of the access## ion negoti## ations with Bulgaria and Roman## ia yesterday , and the read## iness to open negoti## ations with Croatia . 
all the same , it is import## ant to treat e## ach candid## ate country separat## e## ly accord## ing to progress ma## de , not as a package . 
second , the principle that every EU enlarge## ment must be balance## d by a strength## ening of our internal dynamic## s and un## ity is import## ant . 
as my colleague Mr Pinheiro s## aid , &apos; Tur## key is a special case in the enlarge## ment . &quot; 
the open## ing of negoti## ations may be sanction## ed provid## ed all the C## open## hagen crite## ria are clear## ly met , just as in the case of access## ion countries in the final round of negoti## ations . 
this is not y## et the case . 
a fundamental question for govern## ments , how## ever , is the in## conceiv## ability of open## ing negoti## ations with a candid## ate who## s## e milit## ary force## s occupy the ter## rit## ory of an EU Member State , and which does not even recognis## e the exist## ence of that state . 
this position must be ma## de un## equi## vocal## ly clear be## fore the negoti## ations start . 
this is fundamental and can## not just be re## commend## atory ; other## wise , the present ambigu## ity regard## ing the crite## ria will creat## e a precede## nt where## by s## uch accommo## d## ations in regard to large candid## ate countries may begin to repeat them## selves . 
this , how## ever , will under## mine the sense of securit## y of other , small## er countries in the futur## e . 
I also call on the Commission to consider Ukraine &apos;## s prospect## s for the futur## e , be## cause it is in Ukraine that the question of the EU &apos;## s eastern border is be## ing decide## d today . 
yesterday a represent## ative of the Ukrainian people was here - the Ukrainian Euro## vision So## ng Con## test winner Ruslan## a , who prob## ably ha## s a great## er number of support## ers th## an any Ukrainian politic## ian . 
her mess## age was this : &apos; show me the room in this build## ing where we could hand in Ukraine &apos;## s access## ion application . &quot; 
today there is no s## uch room , but for th## ose of us who support the democratic re## birth of Ukraine , it is our business to heed this mess## age and to make s## ure that this room is found and ma## de read## y for use in the near futur## e . 
Mr President , today &apos;## s debate about the European summit at the week## end ha## s become a continu## ation of our discuss## ion about Tur## key , which we beg## an on Mon## day even## ing , and which we will bring to a conclusion im## mediate## ly after this debate , when we vot## e on the Eur## ling## s Report . 
it is a good thing that this House should devote a lot of time to the issue of Tur## key &apos;## s read## iness to join the European Union . 
that is what the public expect## s of this Parliament . 
how## ever , the people at home also expect us to base our debate and our decision## s on a serious ana## lysis of the fact## s , and it is in this regard that I have some doubt## s . 
what ha## s be## en s## aid here today about Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion ha## s li## ttle to do with the re## ality in that country . 
the Dutch Presidency ha## s express## ly stated in the introdu## ction that Tur## key ha## s fulfill## ed the political access## ion crite## ria , and thu## s is a democratic state under the rule of law , where basic right## s , and e## special## ly the right## s of minor## ities , are respect## ed . 
the President of the Commission ha## s obvi## ously read the most re## cent Commission Pro## gress Report more close## ly . 
he s## peak## s in## stead about the fact that Tur## key meet## s the political crite## ria . 
this ap## parent## ly mean## s , a## mong other thing## s , that torture is no long## er system## atic## ally us## ed in Turk## ish prison## s , and that women can hope to one day have the same right## s as men in Turk## ish soci## ety . 
it seem## s that a lot of my fellow @## -## @ Member## s in this House are bas## ing the## ir opinion## s on this principle of hope - particular## ly all th## ose who are to the left of centre and who , I suspect , will be in the major## ity . 
Mr Schu## lz , Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , and other## s , have told us that a Tur## key that is secular and respect## s the rule of law would strength## en Europe &apos;## s communit## y of value## s . 
that is tru## e . 
a secular Tur## key which respect## s the rule of law would in## de## ed strength## en Europe &apos;## s communit## y of value## s . 
the Tur## key of today , though , is s## till a long way from these value## s . 
if we do not admit this to our## selves , we are not on## ly be## ing dis## honest with the public , but are also endanger## ing the st## ability and securit## y that ha## s hither## to be## en achiev## ed in the European Union . 
let us not proceed further down the road of auto## matic accept## ance of access## ion , or at least not where and when the fact## s do not re## ally just## ify it . 
. Mr President , I am grat## e## ful for the remark## s ma## de by man## y and of which I have take## n good note in prepar## ation for the European Council that is due to be held on Thursday and Fri## day . 
let me start with the fundamental debate ra## ised by a number of Member## s of this House , that be## ing the debate about what the European Union is , what Europe is . 
I am ver## y much at one with a number of Member## s , of whom Mr Wat## son was the first and most out## spoken , who state that the European Union is not a religious communit## y . 
I am also in agree## ment with Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , who point## ed out that Europe is not a cultural communit## y either . 
as Mr Schu## lz and other## s stated , Europe , the European Union , is a communit## y of value## s . 
European integration is a political project ra## ther th## an a religious one . 
in that connect## ion , Mr## s U## ca ma## de the helpful remark that , with Tur## key in mind , that conclusion can also be a bridge to Islam and in## de## ed , we can use it to illust## rate that Europe is a political and not a religious project . 
convers## e## ly , Tur## key can use it to demonst## rate that a country that is Islamic for the most part can also be a democratic and function## ing constitutional state . 
some of you , including Mr Maat## en and Mr Lehne , have spoken in explic## it term## s and with appreci## ation about the s## eries of conference## s on the nature of Europe and the es## s## ence of the value## s we share . 
one of the import## ant less## ons that we can draw from the discuss## ion about European value## s and European ident## ity is that we must , in fact , be care## ful about focus## ing on European ident## ity . 
we all know , from the past cent## ury , what the advers## e effect## s can be of an ident## ity that ha## s be## en impose## d from above . 
we also realis## e that in term## s of share## d European value## s , man## y of th## ose are , in fact , universal value## s , and we want them to be exact## ly that . 
de## spite this , there are discern## able European trait## s with regard to the way in which we app## ly th## ose value## s , how we can invoke them and how we organise them . 
there are definite## ly specific European accent## s that are evident in th## ose value## s , one import## ant ex## ample be## ing tolerance . 
this bring## s me to the enlarge## ment debate , which attract## ed man## y speaker## s , start## ing with the debate about Tur## key . 
we held that debate yesterday and conclude## d that , be## cause of the concern## s about it , we will , in time , need to clear## ly demonst## rate the huge advantage## s of the possibil## ity of Tur## key join## ing . 
Mr Schu## lz mention## ed securit## y as one of the advantage## s . 
Mr Wat## son not## ed that Tur## key sufficient## ly meet## s the crite## ria , and that is also , in agree## ment with the Commission &apos;## s conclusion , the preside## ncy &apos;## s position follow## ing the ent## ry in## to force of the six law## s . 
Mr Eur## ling## s and other## s point## ed out o## nce again that it is import## ant to maintain pressure on Tur## key in relation to the development## s need## ed in that country in respect of human right## s , religious free## dom and other political crite## ria . 
that is precise## ly why the preside## ncy ha## s decide## d , bas## ed on the Commission propos## al## s , to come up with a new frame## work for futur## e negoti## ations about access## ion . 
that frame## work allow## s for more pressure to be br## ought to bear and offer## s more guarantee## s for smooth progress . 
this s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; emerge## ncy stop opt## ion , &quot; in other word## s an opt## ion of suspens## ion , offer## s guarantee## s in relation to the sensitiv## e political crite## ria . 
it is understand## able that a number of Member## s of this House should , o## nce again , have ra## ised the issue of Cyprus . 
Mr Barros## o include## d it in hi## s introdu## ction , and Mr Adam## ou and Mr Dim## itrak## opoulos allude## d to it too . 
I should like to reiterate the Dutch Presidency &apos;## s key position on this score in the prepar## ations of the Council that will be held at the end of this week . 
we do in## de## ed want Tur## key to recognis## e the fact that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and is one of the Twen## ty @## -## @ F## ive countries . 
we want to bring this about by get## ting Tur## key to sign the protocol to the associ## ation agree## ment . 
Mr van den Berg ha## s ask## ed specific## ally whet## her the preside## ncy can confirm that the intention is that no access## ion d## ate be set . 
I can confirm ver## y emphatic## ally that that is in## de## ed the preside## ncy &apos;## s intention . 
an## other question , relate## d to the political crite## ria , was whet## her the preside## ncy can confirm that Tur## key will not join un## less it is read## y . 
here too , I can definite## ly confirm that to be the case . 
final## ly in connect## ion with Tur## key , I should like to ra## ise the sensitiv## e issue which will be discuss## ed present## ly in Parliament , name## ly the s## o @## -## @ call## ed open @## -## @ end## ed## ness of the negoti## ations . 
o## nce again , Mr van den Berg ask## ed specific## ally what the preside## ncy &apos;## s intention is . 
let me make it clear o## nce more : the preside## ncy &apos;## s intention is that these should be access## ion negoti## ations with access## ion in mind . 
that is my first point . 
my second is that , follow## ing on from the Commission &apos;## s comment## s , it is an open @## -## @ end## ed process . 
there is no guarantee as to the out## come . the thir## d element is that European cohes## ion must in any e## vent remain sufficient## ly guarantee## d , but the Dutch Presidency &apos;## s understand## ing for Thursday &apos;## s and Fri## day &apos;## s conclusion## s is that there is in## de## ed no Plan B . 
since we will be discuss## ing Roman## ia and Bulgaria later on , I will now confine my## self to a few fundamental remark## s in respons## e to question## s in this respect . 
Mr Wat## son and Mr Be## c## s## ey , a## mong other## s , have insist## ed on a separat## e approach for Bulgaria on the one hand and Roman## ia on the other . 
in that connect## ion , it is use## ful to point out that , as you know , no distinct## ion can be drawn in the agree## ment , but one can , if necess## ary , be drawn with regard to the d## ate of access## ion , be## cause the opt## ion ha## s be## en introduce## d and agree## d , if there is cause for this , to decide to suspend access## ion of the country in question for one year at most . 
that is also the respons## e to the question## s by Mr Eur## ling## s , Mr## s O## omen @## -## @ Ruijten and Mr Kirk## hope , who are s## till deep## ly concern## ed about the situ## ation in Roman## ia and emphasis## e the import## ance of continu## ing to bring maxim## um pressure to bear on the development## s there . 
I share that view , and that is why we in the Presidency have propos## ed that the Council should conclude that we want additional provision## s in term## s of monitor## ing and specific benchmark## s for Roman## ia , coup## led with a potent## ial sanction , if necess## ary , of one year &apos;## s suspens## ion . 
a number of Member## s have ma## de reference to Croatia , and , as it is not a separat## e item on the age## nda , I think that , de## spite the up## roar in the Chamber , it would be use## ful to give you a precise respons## e to this . 
Mr Pinheiro and Mr Be## c## s## ey have indic## ated that Croatia ha## s ma## de much progress in mov## ing close## r to Europe , and that it is a European country . 
I should like to emphatic## ally endorse bo## th of these statement## s . 
much progress ha## s be## en ma## de and the country is located in the centre of Europe . 
in add## ition , Mr Wat## son , Mr van den Berg and Mr Swoboda we## re right to point out that full co## operation with the ICT## Y ( Inter## national Criminal Tri## bu## ne for the Form## er Yugoslav## ia ) is of vital import## ance . 
I would say to Mr Swoboda and to Mr Be## c## s## ey that it would , of course , be good if we could make that posit## ive step , also bear## ing in mind the ful## fil## ment of Croatia &apos;## s role as a model in the Balkan## s . 
I agree with Mr Swoboda that we must try to have a posit## ive decision . 
that is the preside## ncy &apos;## s commit## ment and that mean## s that in## de## ed , we can decide in favour of open## ing negoti## ations at the begin## ning of next year , provid## ed that these are specific## ally link## ed to full co## operation with the ICT## Y . 
an## other import## ant point that man## y of you have ra## ised is that of combat## ing terrorism , the major significance of which ha## s also be## en under## line## d by President Barros## o and Mr Pinheiro , a## mong other## s . 
in add## ition , Mr Wat## son , Mr## s Malm## s## tröm and Mr## s Buitenweg we## re right , in my view , to point out the import## ance of s## tri## king a balance between fight## ing terrorism and fundamental right## s . 
I agree with them , and I think that Mr Ma## art## en was right to point out that we , in the Ha## gue Pro## gramme , have demonst## rated the Council &apos;## s desir## e to pre## serve that balance . 
Mr Eur## ling## s specific## ally ask## ed about ways of ban## ning organisation## s . 
he will be aware that that is a respons## ibility , a compete## nce , of the Member State## s , but we will definite## ly ensu## re that inform## ation about it is exchange## d between them . 
Mr Eur## ling## s , and other## s , see the exchange of inform## ation as cruc## ial to the fight again## st terrorism . 
that is the corner## stone of this preside## ncy , and is also include## d in the Council &apos;## s age## nda for Thursday and Fri## day . 
over these past six month## s , we have ma## de concrete progress in making it easi## er to exchange criminal record## s , coll## ating intellig## ence and in relation to situ## ation centre## s and threat analyse## s that can be car## ried out in th## ose centre## s . 
as you know , we will be ask## ing the Commission to table a more detail## ed propos## al for the exchange of inform## ation , as provid## ed for in the Ha## gue Pro## gramme . 
at the re## quest of a number of Member## s , I am happy to inform you specific## ally of the European Council &apos;## s intention , next Thursday and Fri## day , to decide whet## her , in principle , to appoint a European human right## s ambassador . 
man## y in this House s## poke about the financial perspective . 
in hi## s introdu## ctory remark## s , Mr Barros## o mention## ed the import## ance of add## ed value where the multi @## -## @ annual budget and budget disciplin## e are concern## ed , and he had good reason to do s## o , but he also express## ed hi## s concern , which was sub## sequent## ly give## n great## er emphasis by other## s , about the 1 % approach and the import## ance of sufficient fund## ing for Europe &apos;## s priorit## ies . 
it is there## fore use## ful to indic## ate the Council &apos;## s position on this score . 
we subscrib## e to man## y of the priorit## ies mention## ed here , but it remain## s import## ant in every financial discuss## ion , in add## ition to the priorit## ies , to determine the posteriori## ties , and not on## ly count the priorit## ies . 
that is exact## ly what we in the Presidency have done with what we call our &apos; build## ing block## s &quot; approach , in which we have tri## ed to draft a summa## ry and compile posteriori## ties ra## ther th## an on## ly priorit## ies . 
I can re## assure a number of Member## s who are worri## ed about what is going to happen on Thursday and Fri## day . 
Mr## s Gross## etête fear## ed that we would be taking a decision about 1 % which would not be under## stood by the citizen## s . 
the Council ha## s not adopt## ed a position on the 1 % , let that be ver## y clear . 
bas## ed on the Commission propos## al## s , which are s## till the gui## d## ing principle - be## cause , after all , the new Parliament quit## e right## ly value## s them great## ly - the Council ha## s simpl## y out## line## d the position## s of the Member State## s , bo## th priorit## ies and posteriori## ties , and it is on th## ose that we will be bas## ing our decision## s . 
I am keen to concur with Mr Wat## son in hi## s concern## s about the financial account## ability and hi## s concern about the fact that , for the ten## th time now , the Court of Audit## ors ha## s not issu## ed a State## ment of A## s## sur## ance about expend## iture . 
d## uring our preside## ncy , we have take## n step## s to improve that situ## ation by mean## s of s## ing## le audit## s , and we will discuss this in more detail in the spring . 
as far as the EU &apos;## s external policy is concern## ed , I think we have experience## d a histo## ric moment , one that was mention## ed by man## y . 
Mr Schu## lz was the first one to s## peak about it , and was ver## y frank , as was Mr## s Nap## oletano . 
that moment had to do with Ukraine . 
I think that the stance that we - the European Parliament , the Commission and Council - have take## n ha## s demonst## rated our ability to s## peak with one voice where external policy is concern## ed . 
in my view , that is a ver## y import## ant step in the progress we manage## d to bring about in the democrat## isation process in Ukraine . 
it is also a ver## y import## ant step to## ward s## peak## ing with one voice in external policy . 
that is a first step and we intend to take more of them on the bas## is of the new Treat## y . 
I can be brief about the next subject , name## ly the Lisbon strate## gy , which was ra## ised by a number of Member## s , including Mr Maat## en , Mr Kirk## hope and Mr Title## y . 
you know that this subject is not on this Council &apos;## s age## nda , as it will be ra## ised in the spring . 
how## ever , we will per## sever## e , and it is tru## e that the implement## ation of the Lisbon strate## gy is one of the key component## s . 
as Mr Maat## en and Mr Kirk## hope stated , it is also tru## e that de## regulation and the reduction of the administ## rative burden is cruc## ial for our competitive## ness in the world . 
I turn , final## ly , to the issue of public involve## ment and the import## ance of trans## par## ency and open## ness . 
what I should like to say to Mr## s Buitenweg with regard to open## ness is that we have , d## uring our preside## ncy , tri## ed to creat## e more open## ness in the Council meet## ing## s where## ver possible . 
in add## ition , a un## ique meet## ing took place in Amsterdam involv## ing all European Affair## s minister## s . 
the whole of this meet## ing was public , as was an inform## al industrial meet## ing . 
I should like to end on an optim## istic note . 
Mr Maat## en congratul## ated the preside## ncy on promot## ing the public &apos;## s involve## ment by mean## s of good communic## ation . 
I am not certain whet## her it ha## s any## thing to do with that , but accord## ing to the la## test Euro## barometer survey , there is an increas## e in the public &apos;## s posit## ive involve## ment . 
the per## cent## age of citizen## s who say that EU member## ship is a good thing ha## s rise## n from 48 % to 56 % . 
that is not en## ough , but is n## ever## the## less a big step forward and I should like to end on this happy note . 
in any case , I would like to thank you for your attention . 
Mr President , on be## half of President Barros## o and the whole of the Commission , I wish to thank you for this debate , which ha## s provid## ed us with man## y valu## able and construct## ive propos## al## s and view## point## s . 
the debate ha## s also reflect## ed the EU &apos;## s ambitious and demand## ing age## nda over the next few year## s . 
I have on## ly one s## ing## le thing to add to what ha## s al## read## y be## en s## aid by President Barros## o and the Presidency of the Council . 
this ha## s to do with an aspect of the Commission &apos;## s propos## al concern## ing Tur## key . 
parallel to the negoti## ations on which the Commission wish## es to embark with Tur## key , a cultural dia## logue is also propos## ed . 
this will serve as a channel for the anxie## ty and prejudice## s that are to be found , as well as for the real differ## ence## s that exist between the EU and Tur## key , and will ensu## re that we can over## come all these by embark## ing upon a bilateral dia## logue in civil soci## ety too . 
that is some## thing I believ## e is ver## y import## ant if we are also to investig## ate and resolv## e a number of the argument## s put forward in this House . 
these often have to do with a fear of what is view## ed as un## known or fright## ening . 
re## member that s## uch fear is felt on bo## th side## s . 
I believ## e this to be an import## ant instrument in the dia## logue . 
the concern## s in question are of course of ten year## s &quot; dur## ation when it come## s to the issue of Tur## key . 
it is also import## ant to ask our## selves some fundamental question## s in the run @## -## @ up to this import## ant decision . 
what is it that can bring about the strong## est force## s in favour of a secular Tur## key character## ised by legal certain## ty ? 
what would be the risk## s and the effect## s of signal## ling a change to the EU &apos;## s political direct## ion when it come## s to embark## ing upon negoti## ations with Tur## key ? 
I hope , in## de## ed am convince## d , that the debate that ha## s be## en conduct## ed in this House today will be a sound bas## is for the discuss## ions that are to be conduct## ed by the Council and that will continu## e to be conduct## ed in the Commission too . 
the debate is closed . 
we s## hall now proceed to the vot## e . 
the next item is the vot## e . 
Mr Wat## son ha## s the floor for a point of order . 
which Rule of Procedure are you in## vo## king , Mr Wat## son ? 
Mr President , I rise be## cause in ten year## s of service in this House I can## not recall an in## stance similar to that regard## ing today &apos;## s vot## e on the Eur## ling## s report .## .. 
I would ask you to obey the Rule## s of Procedure and indic## ate which Rule you are in## vo## king . 
I apolog## ise , Mr President , I should like to make a point of order under Rule 16## 2 . 
as I was say## ing , in ten year## s &apos; service I can## not recall a similar in## stance to that with which we are fac## ed today . 
we consist## ent## ly demand of the Council and the Commission open## ness and trans## par## ency in political decision## s .## .. 
.## .. and it is an extra## ordinary practice for Member## s of this House to ask for a secret ballot on a political decision under Rule 16## 2 , which is design## ed for the appoint## ment of individual## s . 
how can we be account## able to our elector## s ? 
how can we defend our## selves again## st charge## s of shame and hypo## cris## y ? 
Mr President , I urge you to face down this ram## shackle coal## ition of coward## s and autocrat## s , .## .. 
.## .. to declare a secret vot## e in## admiss## ible on the ground## s that it is un## worthy of this House and to seek an ear## ly change to the Rule## s of Procedure to clar## ify this Rule . 
Mr President , I have rise## n to s## peak on the bas## is of Rule 16## 2 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of our Rule## s of Procedure . 
as Mr Wat## son ha## s just point## ed out , and to pick up on the remark## s ma## de by Mr Po## ette## ring , it is the European Union &apos;## s du## ty to take the histo## ric decision on whet## her or not to open negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
there are th## ose who are oppose## d to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , and I have great respect for these people . 
there are also th## ose who are in favour of s## uch an access## ion , and I have great respect for them too . 
y## et I know of no one whom I respect who lack## s the courage to say what the## y think about Tur## key . 
I would ask Mr Po## ette## ring to make a public statement on whet## her he is for or again## st the secret ballot which will take place in this House today . 
is he personal## ly for or again## st the secret ballot ? 
Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , you may ask the honour## able Member## s to calm down , but I must remind you that you are s## peak## ing on a point of order . 
s## o pleas## e restrict your## self to that . 
I would ask that th## ose Member## s who have sign## ed this re## solution with the far right to withdraw the## ir sign## ature## s , as the re## solution is bene## ath the## ir log## ic and the## ir intellig## ence . 
I call on all th## ose with any self @## -## @ respect to withdraw the## ir sign## ature## s and to vot## e .## .. 
Mr President , we are familiar with Rule 16## 2 , and we also see from the vot## ing list that 1## 47 Member## s are ap## parent## ly in## vo## king Rule 16## 2 to just## ify holding a secret ballot on vari## ous table## d amend## ments and in the final vot## e . 
I would there## fore like to make my group &apos;## s position on Rule 16## 2 clear : the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would prefer a vot## e by roll call , for we believ## e that Europe &apos;## s citizen## s have a right to know how Member## s of the European Parliament are vot## ing on this key issue . 
in our view , the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s in this House is in## cap## able of adh## er## ing to a coherent and un## ified line . 
most of the 1## 47 sign## ature## s come from this group , and I would like to thank the former Belgian Pr## ime Minister , Mr De## ha## ene , for inform## ing the Member## s of this group in un## equi## vocal term## s that while this solution may be accept## able from a legal perspective , political## ly it is complete## ly un## accept## able . 
it is be## coming clear that the point of order relate## s to the application of Rule 16## 2 on secret ballot## s , in accord## ance with the re## quest ma## de . 
Mr President , first## ly , this is one Rule that I di## d not draft . 
second## ly , let me under## line - be## fore you make your ruling - the significance of the word &apos; may &apos; . 
rule 16## 2 ( 2 ) of the Rule## s of Procedure say## s that vot## ing &apos; may &apos; also take place by secret ballot , if re## quest## ed by at least one @## -## @ fifth of the Member## s . 
it does not say &apos; s## hall &apos; . 
the pre## vi## ous paragraph say## s &apos; s## hall &apos; concern## ing vot## ing on nomi## nation## s of individual## s . 
there is a clear differ## ence between the two case## s of &apos; may &apos; and &apos; s## hall &apos; .## .. 
Mr Corbett , we must respect the Rule## s of Procedure . 
I realis## e that you are extreme## ly knowledge## able on the subject , but I have not ask## ed you for ad## vice . 
I take good note of your opinion and I will take it in## to account . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , pleas## e on## ly ra## ise genuine point## s of order . 
other## wise , this debate will go on fore## ver . 
Mr President , with## out wish## ing to offer un## want## ed ad## vice , I should like to make a suggest## ion , name## ly , that the re## quest ma## de by a number of Member## s be put to the House . 
Parliament would th## en be able to decide whet## her or not it is in favour of holding a secret ballot . 
you have ma## de a propos## al to organise our work . 
the Presidency take## s good note of that , but our work is regulate## d by the Rule## s of Procedure and the## y provid## e us with sufficient gui## dance on how to proceed . 
Mr President , I just want## ed to say that accord## ing to my reason - if not to the Rule## s of Procedure - I am again## st the secret ballot and ask colleague## s from my Group - or some of them at least - to withdraw the## ir sign## ature## s . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , this is not a debate on whet## her th## ose who have sign## ed have be## en right to do s## o or whet## her the## y should not sign . 
I am on## ly giving the floor for point## s of order and I would ask you to respect that . 
opinion## s on whet## her it is good or bad to sign or not to sign , on whet## her Member## s should vot## e one way or an## other , may be ver## y interest## ing , but the## y have no place at this point in the procedure . 
accord## ing## ly , if a point of order turn## s out not to be one , the President will cut off the speaker . 
- Mr President , I do not intend to take your job from you or to give you ad## vice . 
how## ever , even if a re## quest for a vot## e by roll call ha## s be## en ma## de , under Rule 16## 2 ( 3 ) of the Rule## s of Procedure the re## quest for a secret ballot s## hall take priorit## y over the re## quest for a vot## e by roll call . 
Mr President , all that I am ask## ing is for you to implement the provision## s of Rule 16## 2 ( 3 ) , under which one fifth of Member## s of Parliament may call for a secret ballot . 
I should like to remind Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , and you , Mr President , that the aim of this is to safeguard our ut## most priorit## y , name## ly free## dom of con## science and express## ion . 
the debate , Mr President .## .. 
Mr President , I invoke the same article as Mr Wurtz . 
the right to a secret ballot is a tradition## al minor## ity right which I defend , al## though I make no secret of the fact that I am vot## ing again## st Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion . 
it ha## s become perfect## ly clear that these are not point## s of order , but ra## ther ex## plan## ations of the att## itude## s of e## ach Member to## ward## s the issue we are deal## ing with and I there## fore see no need or reason to continu## e giving the floor for point## s of order . 
n## ever## the## less , we must organise our work and we must , of course , do s## o in accord## ance with the Rule## s of Procedure , which some## time## s lend them## selves to interpret## ations that must be clar## ified , as in this case . 
the Presidency ha## s receiv## ed three re## quest## s for secret ballot## s present## ed in accord## ance with Rule 16## 2 ( 2 ) of the Rule## s of Procedure , which say## s , and I quote - I will do s## o in S## pan## ish and natural## ly it will have to be translat## ed : &apos; vot## ing may also be by secret ballot if re## quest## ed by at least one @## -## @ fifth of the component Member## s of Parliament . 
s## uch re## quest## s must be ma## de be## fore vot## ing begin## s . &quot; 
with regard to the application of this provision , in this case , having heard th## ose Member## s who have spoken under the guise of point## s of order and natural## ly having s## ought the opinion and the ad## vice of the legal service## s of the House and the General Secretariat , which I am oblig## ed to do , I can tell you the follow## ing : first## ly , that the competent service## s have confirm## ed to me that these re## quest## s have be## en endorse## d by a sufficient number of Member## s and that the## y have in fact be## en present## ed on time . 
second## ly , we have the issue , that some of you have ra## ised , of the interpret## ation of whet## her or not we are oblig## ed to hold a secret ballot , since Rule 16## 2 ( 2 ) , which ha## s be## en mention## ed s## o often this morning , say## s that &apos; vot## ing may also be by secret ballot &quot; ra## ther th## an &apos; vot## ing will also be . &quot; 
there is , there## fore , room for interpret## ation of what the Rule## s of Procedure say . 
further## more , the Court of First In## stance of the European Comm## un## ities issu## ed a judgment in October 20## 01 in which it also interpret## ed the term &apos; may &quot; or &apos; can &quot; as an oblig## atory conditio## n in relation to a Rule of Procedure similar to the one we are deal## ing with now . 
in accord## ance with these precede## nts and regard## less - I would insist - of the opinion## s of any particular person on whet## her matter## s should be done one way or an## other , the Presidency believ## es that , since a re## quest ha## s be## en present## ed on time and correct## ly , we must proceed to a secret ballot .## .. 
.## .. al## though this issue , for futur## e occasion## s , must be consider## ed by Parliament &apos;## s committee respons## ible for issue## s re## l## ating to Rule## s of Procedure . 
we s## hall prob## ably have to clar## ify in the futur## e whet## her or not the Presidency &apos;## s interpret## ation is correct , but at this point in the procedure , the Presidency must take respons## ibility for the decision with## out having the opportun## ity to take the ad## vice of the competent committee## s , and it is my feel## ing , having heard all the Member## s and the legal service## s , that accord## ing to a correct interpret## ation of the Rule## s of Procedure we must proceed to the secret ballot re## quest## ed , and that is what we are going to do . 
with regard to how the vot## e will be take## n , I must inform the honour## able Member## s that I have decide## d that we s## hall use the electro## nic procedure in accord## ance with Rule 16## 1 ( 1 ) and there is , there## fore , no reason to design## ate a col## lege of tell## ers . 
it s## hall be secret , but electro## nic . 
having s## aid that , we s## hall begin the vot## es . 
Mr President , I should like to propos## e an or## al amend## ment to Amendment No 71 , as it mention## s certain fact## s with which not every## one is familiar . 
on be## half of my group , I should like to suggest re## plac## ing the phrase &apos; the re @## -## @ open## ing to pilgrim## s of the Armenian Nation## al Mau## s## ole## um in northern Anato## lia &quot; - in which the word &apos; ma## us## ole## um &quot; is an in## accurate translat## ion - with the phrase &apos; the re @## -## @ open## ing to pilgrim## s of the ruin## ed Armenian church## es of A## ni , near Kar## s in East## ern Anato## lia . &quot; 
non## e of our Armenian friend## s we## re aware of this place or of it## s open## ing to pilgrim## s . 
the same can be s## aid for the second or## al amend## ment I would like to propos## e . 
there is doubt as to whet## her Turk## ish histo## rian## s are in fact keen to carry out research in## to the gen## ocide , and I there## fore propos## e re## mov## ing the reference to &apos; Turk## ish histo## rian## s &quot; in the plural , and mer## e## ly including the name of the head of the## ir school , or &apos; H## al## il B## er## k## ta## y , &quot; the Turk## ish histo## rian who ha## s done a great deal to further our knowledge of the Armenian gen## ocide . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , man## y of you have s## aid that you we## re un## familiar with this name , and that the amend## ment was out of place , but you should now be aware that it is a reference to H## al## il B## er## k## ta## y . 
the rest is to remain un## change## d , as these we## re mer## e## ly clar## ification## s . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , vehicle theft is on the rise in Europe , as is a feel## ing of in## securit## y a## mong our citizen## s . 
Euro## pol tell## s us that of the 1 million @## -## @ p## lus car## s stole## n in 20## 02 , few## er th## an 39 % we## re recover## ed . 
in Parliament we have adopt## ed and re## commend## ed vari## ous measure## s . 
we di## d this as re## cent## ly as Mar## ch and I congratul## ate the Council for final## ly implement## ing some of them . 
better late th## an n## ever . the propos## al submit## ted to us by the N## ether## land## s is well intention## ed but in the wrong form . 
the text submit## ted to us should have fall## en under the s## cope of the first pillar and not the thir## d . 
the Commission up## held our argument## s in this regard . 
some people in this House felt that it should be reject## ed for this reason . 
we saw it different## ly in the Civil Lib## er## ties Committee . 
we have re## mov## ed from the text any## thing that should exclus## ive## ly fall under the Comm## un## ity pillar and include## d any## thing that could be cover## ed by the inter## governmental pillar . 
Mr President , we have prov## ed that Parliament ha## s acted in good faith and is sensitiv## e to the grow## ing problem of car theft and the criminal## ity that go## es with it . 
we should like to give one mess## age to the Council : it would be good if , in the futur## e , the Council and the Member State## s show## ed great## er respect for Parliament &apos;## s prerogative## s . 
one last word to thank all th## ose Member## s of this House who contribut## ed with propos## al## s and ad## vice , in particular the Member## s of the Trans## port Committee and Mr J## ard## im Fernan## de## s and Mr## s Wort## mann @## -## @ Ko## ol . 
Mr President , our or## al Amendment No 28 is intend## ed to provid## e better and more effective protection for the right## s we intend to protect and to do s## o in a realistic mann## er , not through utopia## n propos## al## s . 
for the sake of real## ism , bas## ed on experience , what we are ask## ing , Mr President , is that the express## ion &apos; in the appli## cant &apos;## s own language &quot; be replace## d with the express## ion &apos; a language comprehens## ible to the appli## cant . &quot; 
Mr President , in order not to be tire## some , I will simpl## y say that my argument## s are the same as th## ose I put forward in defence of or## al Amendment No 28 . 
- Mr President , it is with great pleas## ure that I give an ex## plan## ation of my vot## e on the report on Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union . 
I s## hall start by say## ing that I vot## ed again## st Tur## key join## ing the European Union , but I should like to explain how I arriv## ed at that decision . 
last week , on 9 Dec## ember , I found my## self in Re## ggio Cal## ab## ria , where I had be## en invit## ed by the Pension## ers &quot; Part## y official Carl## o Ro## s## itan## i to give a lecture at the Tom## mas## o Gul## li Te## ach## er T## rain## ing Col## lege . 
I ask## ed a class of about 1## 20 girl## s aged between 16 and 19 to vot## e for or again## st Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union . 
the ballot of these 1## 20 young## ster## s ga## ve the follow## ing result : 1## 00 girl## s out of 1## 20 vot## ed again## st access## ion while the other 20 abstain## ed . 
I have there## fore will## ing## ly gone a## long with th## ose young people &apos;## s vot## e . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I vot## ed again## st the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
this is a matter of principle for me . 
the European Union , found## ed in Rome in 19## 57 , ha## s al## ways define## d it## self in Christ## ian and democratic term## s , bas## ed on Greek philosoph## y , Roman law and Christ## ian faith . 
as a result of today &apos;## s pro## found## ly mis## guide## d decision by the European Parliament , we are abandon## ing this spirit of Rome . 
the former French President , Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing , is quit## e right : it would in## de## ed be the end of the EU as we know it . 
may God protect the West &apos;## s Christ## ian civil## isation . 
Mr President , I vot## ed in favour of the report on Tur## key and I believ## e we di## d good work today . 
we have give## n encourag## e## ment to th## ose in## side Tur## key and in## de## ed to th## ose out## side Tur## key who have campaign## ed and work## ed hard for a secular Turk## ish state , a Turk## ish state bas## ed on demo## cracy and a Turk## ish state that respect## s human right## s . 
we have also s## ent a strong mess## age to the 15 million Mus## lim## s who al## read## y live in## side the European Union that this is not an exclus## ive Christ## ian club . 
s## o all in all I am ver## y pleas## ed with the work we have car## ried out this morning . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to remind all Member## s of this House , bo## th th## ose who vot## ed for and th## ose who vot## ed again## st , that the vot## e was not on whet## her Tur## key should be accept## ed in## to the European Union or not . 
this may well be a good thing . 
what Parliament ha## s done is to vot## e in favour of open## ing negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
whet## her Tur## key join## s the European Union or not will depend on the course of these negoti## ations and on the## ir out## come . 
it is my impress## ion that there are s## till Member## s of the House who are not aware of this . 
- Mr President , I am oppose## d to Parliament &apos;## s decision to begin negoti## ations on Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , be## cause Tur## key is not Europe ! 
in add## ition , we are running the risk of one day see## ing a flag fly## ing over these institution## s - the Turk## ish flag - which is s## till stained with the blood of the Armenian people , who## s## e ho## l## ocaust is not recognis## ed by Tur## key . 
we have betray## ed the spirit of Lepanto , a thousand @## -## @ year tradition of a Europe that is and want## s to remain attach## ed to it## s Christ## ian root## s . 
Turk## ish soci## ety , more## over , is s## till close## ly ti## ed to the principle## s of Islamic fundamental## ism , and that is a grave danger of which Europe should be more aware . 
we are there## fore proud to have vot## ed again## st start## ing the procedure## s for Tur## key to join Europe , and we consider that th## ose European politic## ians who ir## respons## ibly support## ed that decision should be ashamed of them## selves , be## cause the decision go## es again## st the wish## es of the major## ity of the people . 
we call for a refer## endum to be held in all the countries of the European Union s## o that the people can have the## ir say , be## cause the people## s of Europe are again## st Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion . 
Mr President , in of 8 Dec## ember , Mr Erdogan , the Turk## ish Pr## ime Minister , stated that if the EU is not a Christ## ian club , th## en it should be possible for an Islamic country s## uch as Tur## key to join . 
what this mean## s is that Europe should abandon it## s individual## ity , or a large proportion of it any## way , while Tur## key is allow## ed to stay an Islamic club . 
a few days later , Mr Erdogan , in alert## ed the European leader## s to the fact that viol## ence from Islamic extremis## ts could escalate if Europe reject## s Tur## key as a candid## ate country . 
since Mr Erdogan is him## self from that back## ground , we can consider this as a down## right threat , as blackmail , pur## e and simpl## e . 
we in the European Parliament no long## er even have the self @## -## @ respect to act again## st that kind of blackmail . 
more## over , how will we in futur## e reject application## s from Moro## cco , for ex## ample , if we include a non @## -## @ European country s## uch as Tur## key ? 
the public is be## ing take## n for a ride ; we are told that Tur## key is be## ing assess## ed accord## ing to the C## open## hagen crite## ria , but that does not appear to be the case . 
it is not a problem that in Tur## key , torture is be## ing car## ried out on a mass## ive scale , that Tur## key ha## s it## s troop## s occupy## ing part of the ter## rit## ory of an exist## ing Member State and even re## fuse## s to recognis## e that state . 
I can on## ly conclude that we in this House have become too pusillanim## ous to carry on protect## ing our own interest## s as European## s . 
Mr President , let me focus on the posit## ive aspect## s first . 
we have intens## ified our confront## ation course on human right## s issue## s - which is direct## ed again## st the Turk## ish Govern## ment , not the Turk## ish people - by call## ing for right## s and free## dom## s for the Kurd## s and for the gen## ocide perpet## rated again## st the Armenian## s to be acknowledg## ed and proper## ly examin## ed . 
an## other posit## ive point is that we have not demand## ed Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion , but mer## e## ly the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations , which I vot## ed again## st . 
give## n that the Member## s who are in favour of access## ion negoti## ations include man## y who are ultimate## ly oppose## d to access## ion , we appear to be on the right track . 
we we## re in the minor## ity at first , but our course is now endorse## d by the large## st group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s , and we just need an## other 40 Member## s to adopt a clear position over the coming year## s . 
there will th## en be no major## ity in this House in favour of Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union when we final## ly take a bind## ing vot## e on this issue . 
that apart , it is a matter for the P## PE @## -## @ DE Head## s of Govern## ment , at the Bru## ssels summit in two days &apos; time , to stop the on## ward s## urge of the lem## ming## s , which inevit## ably end## s in disaster . 
. 
our Europe is an open Europe , found## ed on the European public culture deriv## ed from our common value## s and standard## s . 
this &apos; un## ity in divers## ity &quot; is bo## th Europe &apos;## s most import## ant character## istic and it## s great## est asset . 
the implic## ation of s## uch a political project is that there are limit## s . 
the Union &apos;## s further enlarge## ment should not stand in the way of it## s be## coming even deep## er . 
after all , Turk## ish member## ship threaten## s to turn the Union in## to a mer## e## ly economic co## operative which will no long## er be able to carry out import## ant supranational respons## ibil## ities in a co## ordinate## d mann## er . 
a Union de## void of any strength and spirit , paralyse## d by internal contradict## ions ; that is not the out## come for which man## y had work## ed and about which the## y had dream## ed . 
there is no doubt that Tur## key ha## s ma## de an import## ant journey over the past few year## s . 
these reform## s and in @## -## @ depth economic co## operation must definite## ly be continu## ed . 
in this respect , a special partner## ship between the Union and Tur## key seem## s to be the appropriate rout## e , in which , a## long## side far @## -## @ reach## ing economic co## operation , conditio## ns can also be agree## d in the area## s of the Kurd## s , women &apos;## s right## s and human right## s in general . 
since this latter element is not provid## ed for in the report , I s## hall be vot## ing again## st the report and the re## solution . 
. 
al## though the Commission &apos;## s report was well @## -## @ found## ed , it## s re## commend## ations of 6 October no long## er require## d Tur## key to recognis## e the Armenian gen## ocide of 19## 15 . 
this gen## ocide result## ed in the death of over one million people , which was equi## valent to near## ly two thir## d## s of the country &apos;## s large## st minor## ity . 
this crime , which was car## ried out with in## tent and which led to wide## spread and system## atic destruct## ion , was the first gen## ocide of the twen## tieth cent## ury , and y## et even today the Turk## ish State continu## es to oppose reference## s to it . 
the wor## st possible course of action now would be to remain sil## ent . 
the Commission &apos;## s silence could lead one to think that this trage## dy does not concern it in any way , and that it is a problem for Turk## s and Armenian## s al## one . 
this is some## thing I find disturb## ing , not for reason## s of religio## n , histo## ry or communit## y , but be## cause this is a political issue which ha## s direct bear## ing on demo## cracy and human right## s . 
this is an issue which go## es back to the ver## y found## ations of the European Union , laid after the Second World War when France and Germa## ny affirm## ed the## ir desir## e to bring peace to Europe . 
this mean## t that our continent &apos;## s most tragi## c hour## s we## re over## come , even though the full ex## tent of the ex## termination of Jew## s would not be fully acknowledg## ed until later . 
this is why the Armenian issue is cruc## ial for a Europe seek## ing to become an area of free## dom and anti @## -## @ total## itarian## ism where a modern and secular citizen## ship flourish## es . 
. 
I abstain## ed from vot## ing on the European Commission &apos;## s 20## 04 regular report and re## commend## ations on Tur## key &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion for the follow## ing reason## s . 
I believ## e that the European Union &apos;## s in## ability to formulate , approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the wel## coming of Tur## key in## to the Comm## un## ity . 
it appear## s to me to be question## able , if not ir## respons## ible , to pursu## e a policy of n## ever @## -## @ end## ing enlarge## ment at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and it## s social and tax harmon## isation are far from a re## ality . 
at present , the European Union is not in a position to make political propos## al## s of genuine integration to a country the s## ize of Tur## key . 
I would note that our position is not bas## ed on argument## s re## l## ating to geo## graphic## al , historical , religious or cultural aspect## s . 
it is not Tur## key &apos;## s ability to meet a certain number of conditio## ns which ha## s cause## d me to hold s## uch a view , but the European Union &apos;## s in## ability to provid## e the necess## ary frame## work to creat## e a common futur## e . 
. - On be## half of the CS## U Member## s of the European Parliament , I would like to clar## ify our position in relation to the possible open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key o## nce more . 
today &apos;## s vot## e ha## s show## n that the &apos; privilege## d partner## ship &apos; model is endorse## d by man## y of our fellow Member## s from all EU Member State## s and all political group## s . 
this refut## es the argument## s , in particular , of th## ose who claim that the CD## U and the CS## U are isolate## d on this issue in Europe . 
I hope that the European Council will also take this in## to account at it## s delibe## rations on Fri## day . 
we continu## e to take the view that the European Union &apos;## s record of success would be mass## ive## ly jeopard## ised by Turk## ish access## ion . 
any## one want## ing Europe to de## generate in## to a free @## -## @ trade area will achiev## e the## ir object## ive through Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion . 
if , on the other hand , we want a strong Europe with the capacity to act , the special relation## ship establish## ed by a privilege## d partner## ship is the appropriate mean## s by which to ful## fil this aim . 
the European Council , at it## s meet## ing on Fri## day , must be mind## ful of this respons## ibility . 
. 
I abstain## ed from vot## ing on the European Commission &apos;## s 20## 04 regular report and re## commend## ations regard## ing negoti## ations on Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union for the follow## ing reason## s . 
I believ## e that the European Union &apos;## s in## ability to formulate , approve and construct a coherent political project is a major obstacle to the wel## coming of Tur## key in## to the Comm## un## ity . 
it appear## s to me to be question## able , if not ir## respons## ible , to follow a policy of n## ever @## -## @ end## ing enlarge## ment at a time when the political dimension of the European Union and it## s social and tax harmon## isation are far from a re## ality . 
at present , the European Union is not in a position to make political propos## al## s of genuine integration to a country the s## ize of Tur## key . 
I would note that my position is not bas## ed on argument## s re## l## ating to geo## graphic## al , historical , religious or cultural aspect## s . 
it is not Tur## key &apos;## s ability to meet a certain number of conditio## ns which ha## s cause## d me to hold s## uch a view , but the European Union &apos;## s in## ability to provid## e the necess## ary frame## work to creat## e a common futur## e . 
. 
I will be vot## ing in favour of open## ing negoti## ations with Tur## key for member## ship of the European Union . 
Tur## key does not as y## et meet the crite## ria for member## ship . 
it## s record on human right## s with respect to it## s Kurd## ish and Assyrian minor## ities is deep## ly flaw## ed . 
it## s record with respect to trade union right## s is poor . 
it ha## s fail## ed proper## ly to come to term## s with the Armenian gen## ocide . 
y## et non## e of these should be seen as bar## rier## s to start## ing a process that will en## able the Commission and Parliament to press for the## ir correct## ion . 
a &apos; y## es &apos; vot## e today will support the campaign## s of all progress## ive force## s in Tur## key to shed the last remnant## s of Tur## key &apos;## s author## itarian past . 
if together we can achiev## e these change## s I will support Tur## key join## ing the Union , as my Europe is bas## ed on share## d value## s that are not limit## ed to one particular set of religious value## s and belief## s . 
if we do not achiev## e this , I will vot## e &apos; no &apos; , even if the economic conditio## ns have be## en met . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of open## ing the process of Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the EU . 
this does not entail making a final decision on this process , which will take year## s to negotiate . 
further## more , I vot## ed again## st partner## ship status , be## cause that would mean that the EU ha## s not honour## ed it## s promise## s . 
I vot## ed in favour , particular## ly in light of the test## imon## ies of numer## ous Turk## ish human right## s defend## ers , who have confirm## ed that there have be## en posit## ive development## s in Tur## key . 
th## ose development## s are not sufficient , of course ; there are s## till political prison## ers , there is s## till torture in prison## s and there remain## s much to do . 
s## topp## ing the process of open## ing negoti## ations at this time would have terr## ible con## sequenc## es for the human right## s situ## ation in Tur## key . 
I vot## ed in favour , al## though we have not had the opportun## ity for serious con## templ## ation as to where Europe should extend , and be## cause I do not accept the political and cultural border## s of the &apos; Christ## ian Club Europe , &quot; nor the prop## hec## ies of the &apos; clash of civil## isation## s . &quot; 
I vot## ed in favour , provid## ed that Tur## key recognis## es , with## out delay , the EU Member State of Cyprus , and withdraw## s , with## out delay , from the part of Cyprus that it occupies militari## ly . 
I vot## ed in favour of acknowledg## ing the gen## ocide of the Armenian people by Tur## key , as I believ## e that this is essential for re## conciliation with it## s neighbour## s and with it## s histo## ry . 
the Ju## ne List does not view Tur## key &apos;## s geo## graphic## al position or it## s Mus## lim religio## n as obstacle## s to it## s member## ship of the EU . 
we welcome the fact that Tur## key is draw## ing close## r to the EU . 
we must not , how## ever , close our eye## s to the fact that bo## th Tur## key and the EU must change be## fore full EU member## ship is possible . 
Tur## key must acknowledg## e the Armenian gen## ocide . 
it must give it## s minor## ities full human right## s . 
it must achiev## e a level of economic development s## uch that it## s member## ship does not re## lease tension## s that may threaten the internal market . 
the EU must also change . 
the common agri## cultural policy must be abolish## ed , and structural policy must be revise## d be## fore Tur## key , large and poor as it is , can be absorb## ed . 
to ensu## re grass @## -## @ root## s support , member## ship negoti## ations should , more## over , on## ly be embark## ed upon o## nce the issue ha## s be## en debate## d in the Member State## s &quot; elect## ion campaign## s up until 20## 08 . 
final## ly , the issue of the EU &apos;## s Constitution must be solv## ed be## fore the EU adopt## s a position on the issue of negoti## ations concern## ing Turk## ish member## ship . 
. 
I vot## ed again## st this report . 
our fellow citizen## s are concern## ed about these futur## e enlarge## ments , and above all about the continu## ing lack of respons## es to the cruc## ial question of where Europe &apos;## s border## s lie . 
Tur## key does not recognis## e the Republic of Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union which it ha## s occupied for 30 year## s , and it punish## es any## one who refer## s to the Armenian gen## ocide . 
nine## ty @## -## @ seven per cent of Tur## key &apos;## s ter## rit## ory is out## side Europe , and Tur## key there## fore ha## s no right to join the European Union . 
Tur## key &apos;## s integration in## to the EU would be tant## amount to reject## ing a political Europe straight## away , be## fore it ha## s even come in## to be## ing , and to perpetu## ating the im## age of a Europe subject to blackmail and pressure . 
would this be a sens## ible course of action ? 
th## ose in favour of Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion hide be## hind the C## open## hagen crite## ria under the pre## text that Tur## key could one day adhere to them , y## et this is a trick . 
it is not en## ough to insist on## ly on adhere## nce to these crite## ria as an in## dispens## able conditio## n to be met be## fore any new access## ion , be## cause this would mean that any country in the world which adhere## d to them could , in it## s turn , join the European Union . 
this is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privilege## d partner## ship put forward by France . 
. 
today this House ha## s final## ly reach## ed a decision on Tur## key &apos;## s member## ship of the European Union . 
this was a vot## e eager## ly await## ed by European citizen## s , who struggle to understand the## ir govern## ments &quot; att## itude## s on this issue . 
I vot## ed again## st the draft report by Mr Eur## ling## s , as it came to the conclusion that &apos; the European Council &#91; should &#93; open the negoti## ations with Tur## key with## out un## due delay , &quot; and that &apos; the object## ive of the negoti## ations is Turk## ish EU member## ship . &quot; 
the European project is a well @## -## @ define## d one , the aim of which is to share a number of compete## nce## s between neighbour## ing and similar countries in order to build a new political whole . 
integrating Tur## key in## to this whole would be problematic for a number of reason## s . 
first## ly , Tur## key is not part of the European continent in geo## graphic## al term## s , as over 90 % of it## s ter## rit## ory is in Asia , and 90 % of it## s border## s are with Asian countries . 
second## ly , through## out histo## ry Tur## key ha## s share## d non## e of our value## s , with s## uch value## s ens## uring that Europe today is bas## ed on a found## ation of common tradition## s kept al## ive by all of us . 
final## ly , I should like to advance a weight## y argument which direct## ly affect## s our institutional structure ; if Tur## key enter## s the European Union it will have the large## st population of any Member State , which will mean .## .. 
. 
the European Parliament## ary Lab## our Part## y strong## ly welcome## s the clear re## commend## ation in this re## solution , that EU leader## s should announce the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key with## out delay . 
we recognis## e the sensitiv## ities with regard to issue## s surround## ing Tur## key &apos;## s relation## s with Arm## en## ia , how## ever these will be deal## t with d## uring the negoti## ations process . 
the report does not in any way imp## ly that re## solution of these issue## s is a precondition to open## ing talk## s . 
we also register our op## position to any per## man## ent safeguard## s affect## ing free move## ment of workers . 
Tur## key should receiv## e equal , fair and proper treat## ment d## uring the negoti## ations . 
- A## s Chair## man of the European Parliament &apos;## s Deleg## ation on the countries of the South Cau## cas## us , I welcome the adopt## ion by a large major## ity of the Eur## ling## s report on open## ing access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key , and would reiterate how cruc## ial it is for the people## s of Europe and for the st## ability of an entire continent to open the door## s of the European Union to this country . 
I regret the fact that the European Union di## d not make the issue of lift## ing the block## ade and open## ing the border with Tur## key &apos;## s neighbour , Arm## en## ia , part of the discuss## ions on Tur## key &apos;## s possible access## ion from the out## set , and I regret that Tur## key ha## s not take## n this histo## ric opportun## ity to show good## will by open## ing it## s border with Arm## en## ia . 
y## et us## ing the border issue and the Armenian gen## ocide as reason## s to re## fuse to open up to Tur## key , as right @## -## @ wing French political part## ies in particular have done , is un## accept## able . 
the## y are wrong to brand## ish this argument s## o s## oon be## fore the Council make## s it## s decision on open## ing negoti## ations , and the## ir on## ly purpose in s## o do## ing is to hide the## ir real reason## s for reject## ing Tur## key &apos;## s integration . 
- More and more European nation## s , follow## ing the ex## ample of the French , Germa## ns , Greek## s and Austria## ns , are show## ing the## ir op## position to Tur## key , an Asian country which is part of the Mus## lim world , enter## ing Europe . 
the leader## s of the Europe of Bru## ssels , in particular Mr Chi## rac , are well aware of this . 
that is why the## y are maintain## ing that open## ing the access## ion negoti## ations would not auto## matic## ally lead to Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion . 
this assert## ion , repeat## ed in Mr Eur## ling## s &quot; report , is an un## truth : since the first enlarge## ment of 19## 72 , every negoti## ation process ha## s be## en follow## ed by the access## ion of the candid## ate country . 
it will be the same for Tur## key , e## special## ly as it## s Islam## ist leader## s have warn## ed us that the## y will not make any concession## s . 
if on 17 Dec## ember , again## st the will of the people , the European Council decide## s to open access## ion negoti## ations with the Turk## ish Govern## ment , the refer## endum on the European Constitution will be France &apos;## s last opportun## ity to avoid be## ing swallow## ed up in a union that is European in name al## one , and in which Tur## key , the most popu## lous country , will play a prominent part . 
- I am again## st any further enlarge## ment until the Union ha## s achiev## ed deep## er political integration and creat## ed a power## ful Europe and a social Europe . 
with e## ach enlarge## ment the prospect of a federal Europe fad## es . 
Tur## key &apos;## s ent## ry will further dilut## e the European project , and it is not desir## able for it to be integrate## d in## to the EU in it## s present form . 
the issue that will arise for every## one ha## s nothing to do with either religio## n or geo## graphy : the European Union ha## s to be a political project . 
this project is now under threat be## cause it is be## ing limit## ed to a free @## -## @ trade area with less and less regulation . 
we need to over## haul the architect## ure of Europe and have a federal core , th## en a Union of 27 countries and th## en a zone of enhance## d co## operation with neighbour## ing countries s## uch as Tur## key , and also other countries like the Mag## hreb countries , with which we enjoy close link## s . 
ap## prov## ing the open## ing of negoti## ations make## s this a more dis## tant prospect and continu## es a policy of on## going enlarge## ment . 
legitimate require## ments are ma## de of Tur## key , but it go## es with## out say## ing that if this country meet## s them it will be im## possible to re## fuse it ent## ry . 
be## fore any possible access## ion negoti## ations we need to define the futur## e shape of Europe . 
we should reject enlarge## ment and begin a different kind of co## operation with Tur## key . 
. 
as a Member of this House , I have belong## ed to the parliament## ary friend## ship group with Tur## key for as long as it ha## s exist## ed . 
no one , there## fore , can accus## e me of not be## ing well @## -## @ dispos## ed to## ward## s Tur## key . 
as thing## s stand , how## ever , I feel I am just## ified in ask## ing whet## her all the conditio## ns - e## special## ly as regard## s human right## s - have genuine## ly be## en fulfill## ed . 
I glad## ly acknowledg## e that on the issue of women &apos;## s right## s , for ex## ample , more reform## s have be## en introduce## d since Tur## key was grant## ed the prospect of access## ion th## an in the deca## de## s be## fore . 
non## e## the## less , the## y have large## ly take## n place on paper ; the re## ality s## till lag## s be## hind . 
I was re## cent## ly confront## ed with inform## ation alleg## ing that steril## isation## s of Kurd## ish women have be## en car## ried out in Tur## key . 
when we sign## ed an Associ## ation Agreement with Tur## key in 19## 63 , which offer## ed the prospect of member## ship , the European Union di## d not exist ; at that time , we we## re s## till the European Eco## nomic Comm## un## ity . 
since a custom## s union with Tur## key ha## s exist## ed since 19## 96 , what we have now is ver## y similar to an economic communit## y in which any remain## ing trade bar## rier## s can be dismantle## d swift## ly . 
from this perspective too , and be## cause there is no question that Tur## key must remain fully anchor## ed in European structure## s , the opt## ion of a tailor @## -## @ ma## de special status in## stead of the discrimin## atory member## ship deal propos## ed by the Commission would appear to be a more access## ible and honour## able path for Tur## key , a## side from the fact that there are just## ified doubt## s .## .. 
. - I vot## ed in favour of the report by Mr Ε## ur## ling## s on Tur## key &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion to the European Union , be## cause it is the product of compromis## e between the vari## ous political group## s in the European Parliament . 
how## ever , I am in no way bound by the phrase in paragraph 38 concern## ing use of the Anna## n plan as a bas## is for ef## fort## s to settle the Cyprus question , in that this plan was reject## ed by 76 % of Greek Cypriot## s and 67 % of all Cypriot## s . 
as Article 38 right## ly say## s , a solution can be found on the bas## is of the principle## s upon which the EU is found## ed . 
I also have reserv## ations about the exact content of paragraph 39 , which I consider to be in## compatible with the report by Mr## s Mechtild Roth## e , which the European Parliament vot## ed in favour of about a month ago ( see : Roth## e report , Amendment No 2 , Recital 4## a ( new ) ( 4## a ) page 6 / 15 ) . 
. 
since the Atatürk revolution in 19## 23 , Tur## key ha## s be## en a typical## ly European country , albeit of the old @## -## @ fashion## ed , author## itarian kind , which we no long## er want in Europe these days . 
the arm## y &apos;## s power is immens## e ; there are political prison## ers ; part## ies and news## paper## s are often ban## ned and an elector## al thresh## old of 10 % keep## s even most legal part## ies out## side of parliament . 
Kurd## s , Armenian## s and Assyrian## s are give## n the cho## ice between leav## ing the country or adapt## ing to the language , the culture and religio## n of the Turk## ish major## ity . 
Tur## key must change a great deal be## fore we can welcome it , not on## ly in it## s legisl## ation but also in dai## ly life . 
after more th## an 40 year## s , it is now propos## ed to open negoti## ations short## ly with a view to full member## ship of the EU . 
that is also what the million## s of European## s of Turk## ish origin want . 
a decision as to whet## her Tur## key may join will be ma## de not be## fore , but d## uring , the negoti## ations . 
there is the risk that the Turk## ish Govern## ment may consider that after three or f## ive year## s &quot; negoti## ations , Tur## key deserve## s EU member## ship , with## out the problem## s of demo## cracy , human right## s and ethnic minor## ities having be## en resolv## ed by th## en , with the potent## ial for conflict## s and an eventual rift . 
the C## open## hagen crite## ria must not be replace## d by Ankara crite## ria . 
. 
I have vot## ed for Tur## key &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion de## spite having serious reserv## ations . 
I would like to emphasis## e that my reason for vot## ing Tur## key &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion is be## cause it is a Mus## lim country and will serve as an import## ant bridge between Europe and the Middle East in particular . 
I have concern## s , how## ever , that Tur## key s## till ha## s a ver## y large number of human right## s abuse## s . 
I also have concern## s that a country with s## uch a mass## ive number of people liv## ing in p## over## ty will not be able to reach the level## s acquir## ed in the , and I fear that the emphasis ha## s be## en on the market access to Tur## key ra## ther th## an the need for Tur## key to conform to the social and environment## al standard## s in the EU . 
I am not interest## ed in see## ing the enlarge## ment of Europe simpl## y in order to see a large## r market . 
an equal emphasis must be plac## ed on social and environment## al consider## ations . 
. - The delegation ha## s vot## ed for the Eur## ling## s report on the open## ing of the access## ion procedure for Tur## key , a procedure that will take sever## al year## s . 
the open## ing of the procedure un## equi## vocal## ly herald## s a change in the political course steer## ed by the Turk## ish Govern## ment , not on## ly in respect of the Comm## un## ity and the C## open## hagen conditio## ns but e## special## ly concern## ing the re## solution of the Armenian and the Kurd## ish question## s . 
the believ## es that the Council decision of 17 Dec## ember should make it un## equi## vocal## ly clear that the open## ing of negoti## ations with Tur## key require## s the Turk## ish Govern## ment &apos;## s recogn## ition of the State of Cyprus , a full Member State of the European Union , and con## sequent## ly the re## solution of the Cypriot question , which mean## s the withdraw## al of the 35## .000 Turk## ish troop## s which , in occupy## ing Cyprus , are occupy## ing a ter## rit## ory of the European Union . 
the will watch to ensu## re that the guarantee## s and conditio## ns include## d in the report are com## plied with , be## cause a success## ful conclusion to Tur## key &apos;## s journey to## ward## s access## ion will not be possible un## less the## y are com## plied with . 
. - Tur## key &apos;## s possible access## ion to the European Union bring## s with it man## y benefit## s and a few risk## s . 
the benefit## s are more political th## an economic since , as well as be## ing a member of NA## TO , Tur## key ha## s sign## ed a custom## s union treat## y with the European Union that al## read## y permit## s free trade . 
it## s access## ion would not on## ly ful## fil the dream of million## s of citizen## s of fully belong## ing to the secular western world , but it would shift the centre of grav## ity of political and economic influence to## ward## s the Medi## terranean bas## in , confirm## ing Europe as a world power no long## er closed in with## in it## s geo## political bound## aries . 
on the other hand , the risk## s that should be take## n in## to consider## ation are , first , the reduce## d like## lihood of see## ing the birth of a Europe with it## s own common foreign policy , as well as the possible difficult## y of making two divers## e religious and cultural ident## ities coexist . 
can it describ## e it## self y## et as a democratic state that respect## s it## s ethnic minor## ities ? 
second## ly , it would have a negat## ive effect on the al## location of European fund## s to region## s current## ly consider## ed to be &apos; lagg## ing be## hind in the## ir development , &quot; s## uch as S## ic## ily , at least in the short term . 
last## ly , Tur## key should withdraw from that part of Cyprus under milit## ary occupation , and it go## es with## out say## ing that it must declare it## s will## ing## ness to square it## s account with histo## ry by acknowledg## ing the error## s it ha## s ma## de over the last hundred year## s .## .. 
- I abstain## ed from the final vot## e on the Eur## ling## s report . 
it would , first## ly , be reason## able not to consider any further enlarge## ment be## fore first de## cid## ing where Europe &apos;## s border## s lie . 
push## ing back the## ir limit## s in## definite## ly risk## s turn## ing Europe in## to nothing more th## an a vast free @## -## @ trade area . 
s## uch a renounc## e## ment is anathema to convince## d federalist## s . 
second## ly , experience show## s that o## nce negoti## ations have be## en open## ed , access## ion inevit## ably follow## s o## nce the candid## ate country meet## s the conditio## ns laid down , and in particular the C## open## hagen crite## ria . 
but al## though we might legitimate## ly hope that Tur## key will continu## e to build on the progress it ha## s ma## de , particular## ly on demo## cracy and human right## s , there is as y## et no guarantee that Europe is prepar## ed to provid## e the resource## s , not least the budget## ary resource## s , to go a## head with s## uch an enlarge## ment in a mutual## ly satisfactory way . 
my abstention is th## en a warn## ing to the European Summit of 17 Dec## ember : no more enlarge## ment with## out deep## er integration ! 
we have to stop present## ing the people## s of Europe with and instruct## ing them to rat## ify decision## s take## n in the## ir absence sever## al year## s ear## lier by the Head## s of State or Govern## ment . 
. 
this report update## s Tur## key &apos;## s development as regard## s it## s eventual access## ion to the EU , in common with the report by Mr Oostl## ander adopt## ed on 1 April . 
as I had the opportun## ity to write th## en , I feel that Tur## key was per## hap## s hasti## ly recognis## ed by the Council as a candid## ate for access## ion . 
in the same way , I believ## e that the Commission re## cent## ly repeat## ed the mistake when it deem## ed that the C## open## hagen crite## ria have al## read## y be## en satisfied , while there are s## till situ## ations s## uch as th## ose detail## ed in the motion for a re## solution that are blatant## ly at vari## ance with this position . 
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;## s position that this must be an open @## -## @ end## ed process , with## out a pre## determine## d out## come , albeit a process that does point to## ward## s access## ion . 
I also share hi## s desir## e to see that , regard## less of the out## come , Tur## key press## es a## head with and firm## ly establish## es the welcome reform## s that it ha## s be## en carry## ing out . 
in s## o do## ing it will confirm it## s cred## ent## ial## s as a fully democratic and respons## ible country and one that respect## s human right## s . 
- I support## ed open## ing access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key , and I di## d s## o for one reason above all : I want a better world for tomor## row , character## ised by st## ability and securit## y . 
no one can see in## to the futur## e , but I know one thing : s## har## ing this area of peace and demo## cracy on which our Union is found## ed is a un## ique opportun## ity that we can## not allow to slip away . 
y## es , we should stand firm in the name of historical truth , which is why I continu## e , as I have done in the past , to demand that the Turk## ish author## ities acknowledg## e the## ir part in the Armenian gen## ocide . 
one truth and one histo## ry : we owe it to that same histo## ry also to re## member that for 50 year## s Tur## key ha## s play## ed an essential role as a loyal ally at the gate## s of Europe . 
standing firm mean## s s## end## ing out a strong mess## age : the marriage will on## ly take place if further consider## able progress is ma## de on respect for minor## ities and gender equal## ity . 
I am pleas## ed that the European Parliament support## ed my amend## ment to Paragraph 26 on zero tolerance with regard to crime## s of honour . 
in conclusion , I would ask that the people have a say in the final decision : refer## endum or consult## ations .## .. 
. man## y advantage## s could be gain## ed from Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union , above all an extens## ion of the common market and a strength## ening of trans## atlantic link## s . 
y## et bo## th these go## al## s can be achiev## ed with## out Tur## key join## ing the European Union . 
the European Eco## nomic Area is an excel## lent ex## ample of a plat## form for good economic co## operation with the EU . 
it could also be use## ful to propos## e a reform of securit## y policy to Tur## key , as the country is one of Europe &apos;## s major strategic partner## s in the field of securit## y . 
a privilege## d partner## ship of this kind with Tur## key would provid## e us with the chance of avoid## ing a cris## is of agri## cultural policy and cohes## ion policy . 
if we wish to avoid migration @## -## @ relate## d conflict## s , we should not be instrument## al in a Mus## lim country be## coming the European Union &apos;## s large## st Member State in the near futur## e . 
it is estimate## d that Tur## key will have a population of a## round 90 million in 20## 20 . 
the development of close## r relation## s with Tur## key should also be kept more in proportion to Europe &apos;## s policy of open## ness to## ward## s Ukraine . 
these are all good reason## s why we can## not vot## e in favour of the Eur## ling## s report . 
we consider it to be im## prudent , as de## spite serious ground## s for op## position to Tur## key &apos;## s member## ship in the EU it continu## es to support s## uch a member## ship . 
the on## going discuss## ion of Tur## key &apos;## s chance## s of join## ing the European Union will fuel increas## ed resent## ment in Tur## key . 
. 
I support## ed the Eur## ling## s report and should like to congratul## ate the rapporteur on hi## s excel## lent work . 
I will say this in public since we we## re un## able to demonst## rate our position in an## other way on account of the un## fortunate secret ballot . 
my vot## e in favour of open## ing negoti## ations certain## ly does not mean that I can## not wait for them to start . 
my group right## ly believ## es that it is actual## ly too s## oon , and I share that view . 
at the same time , though , we would like to remain realistic , be## cause after all , the train was put in motion in 19## 99 and in 20## 02 . 
more## over , we expect that the European Council will give the negoti## ations the green light . 
what matter## s to us in the ballot is that the Union should retain it## s cred## ibility and that we s## end a clear mess## age about the conditio## ns under which these open @## -## @ end## ed negoti## ations are to proceed . 
the conditio## ns in the report are strict , but fair . 
we support them whole## hearted## ly , and that is why I have vot## ed in favour . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of the report be## fore us be## cause I feel that the initiative## s concern## ed , which are intend## ed to adopt a Council decision on vehicle crime with cross @## -## @ border implic## ations , address## es the concern## s that we ought to have as regard## s combat## ing crime . 
further## more , de## spite the fact that confer## ring direct access to SIS may appear to run counter to the rule that &apos; data may not be us## ed for administ## rative purpose## s , &quot; the truth is that the necess## ary safeguard## s are in place to ensu## re that this can## not happen in this case . 
. 
vehicle theft make## s up a significant proportion of crime and ha## s cross @## -## @ border implic## ations for the EU , and as s## uch is an issue re## qui## ring ur## gent action . 
one must also take in## to account the fact that this particular form of crime is more often th## an not on## ly one element of broad## er criminal activity , encompass## ing vari## ous type## s of crime spread a## cross an enormous geo## graphic## al area . 
it is there## fore cruc## ial that the move## ment and registr## ation process for vehicle## s from other Member State## s and , in## de## ed , thir## d countries is monitor## ed extreme## ly care## fully . 
the rapporteur was right to observ## e that the new feature of the Dutch propos## al is that of national contact point## s . 
I feel that it will be use## ful to monitor the effective## ness of the## ir activities and period## ical## ly to review the method## s and practice## s adopt## ed . 
the Commission &apos;## s Whi## te Pa## per on the subject , as propos## ed by the rapporteur , will accord this issue a broad## er s## cope . 
. 
it should be point## ed out , how## ever , that there is a long way to go on this issue , e## special## ly as regard## s implement## ing a common agri## cultural policy that respect## s the exist## ing cultural divers## ity , where## by poli## cies are put in place that promot## e small and medium @## -## @ s## ized farm## ing , in contrast with the current measure## s in place , which , if the## y achiev## e the## ir aim## s , will sacrifice and penal## ise farm## ers with few## er resource## s . 
the creation of MRL## s on pest## icide## s in food for .## .. 
. 
I welcome this report and the object## ive## s contain## ed with## in it . 
how## ever , we must re## member that having establish## ed regulation## s for maxim## um residue level## s of pest## icide## s in food and feed of plant and anim## al origin , the main priorit## y must be that it is proper## ly implement## ed and regulate## d . 
consum## ers deserve to be protect## ed and thorough implement## ation can safe @## -## @ guard the## ir right## s . 
. 
I whole## hearted## ly welcome this report , be## cause I consider that re## cast## ing and stream## lining Comm## un## ity legisl## ation in this area foster## s trade with## in the internal market and with thir## d countries , and does no harm from a Port## uguese perspective . 
. 
the propos## al be## fore us seek## s to re## cast Comm## un## ity legisl## ation on pest## icide## s by re## plac## ing the four direct## ive## s in force with one s## ing## le regulation . 
the propos## al also seek## s to safeguard certain key object## ive## s , s## uch as establish## ing a homogen## ous level of consum## er protection through## out the Comm## un## ity , by defi## ning the role of the European Food Safety Author## ity , and by increas## ing the trade in food## stuff## s with## in the EU . 
I believ## e that significant progress ha## s be## en ma## de between the first and second read## ing## s , name## ly the Council &apos;## s adopt## ion of bo## th the amend## ments table## d by Parliament and the introdu## ction of amend## ments to it## s initiative , which have certain## ly improve## d the Commission &apos;## s origin## al propos## al . 
I feel , how## ever , that there remain aspect## s that could be clar## ified , s## uch as the distinct## ion between residue## s - in the con## text of maxim## um residue limit## s ( MRL## s ) - and pest## icide## s . 
I agree with the rapporteur , how## ever , that when MRL## s are exceed## ed , th## ose respons## ible must be held to account and sub## group## s that may consum## e more of a certain type of product must be fully protect## ed . 
Mr President , I welcome the fact that we have ma## de our position clear to Russia . 
like Tur## key , Russia is a country which is on## ly part## ly European and will n## ever join the EU , but it is an extreme## ly import## ant partner . 
how## ever , precise## ly be## cause it is an import## ant partner , we must steadfast## ly oppose the system## atic d## ism## ant## ling of demo## cracy and the rule of law in Russia and the continu## ing gen## ocide again## st the Chechen people in a colonial war . 
I there## fore wish to s## end a clear mess## age to President Pu## tin from this House : we regard Russia as an import## ant partner , but the statement which he ha## s ma## de again## st Ukraine , it## s libera## tion move## ment and the libera## tion of C## ent## ral and East## ern Europe is an attack on free Europe . 
we are hop## ing for co## operation here , not for a continu## ation of this un## accept## able confront## ation course . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of this motion for a joint re## solution be## cause I feel that the question be## fore us - relation## s between the EU and Russia , which is an import## ant international play## er and the most import## ant neighbour of man## y of the countries cover## ed by our neighbour## hood policy - is cruc## ial## ly import## ant for the futur## e of the area that we share through## out the European continent , and as regard## s certain concern## s at world level . 
n## ever## the## less , I must point out that , in spite of the reserv## ations that I have express## ed , I welcome the concern at Russia &apos;## s inter## ference in countries that we## re pre## vi## ously part of it## s sphere of influence . 
. 
the strategic relev## ance of relation## s between the EU and the Russia## n Fede## ration is un## deni## able , and the on## going initiative## s to promot## e and institutional## ise th## ose relation## s are to be welcome## d . 
in## de## ed , common border## s and interest## s combin## e to creat## e an enlarge## d area of understand## ing , give## n the mutual interest in maintain## ing per## man## ent dia## logue on the field## s propos## ed for the four common space## s , the common economic space ; the common space of free## dom , securit## y and justice ; the common space of co## operation in the field of external securit## y ; the common space of research , educ## ation and culture . 
that is not to over## look the worry## ing sign## s in the area of human right## s and civil lib## er## ties that have come to light in Russia , as regard## s political process## es and procedure## s and the question of Chechnya . 
the same can also be s## aid of Mos## cow &apos;## s disastrous intervention## s , re## cent## ly in Ukraine and pre## vi## ously in Georgia and Belarus , which have done nothing to benefit the political process## es of th## ose countries . 
I note and appreci## ate the desir## e show## n by Russia to celeb## rate the 60## th annivers## ary of the Second World War , but I complete## ly reject the mann## er in which the victor## y for demo## cracy and free## dom is compar## ed with the criminal total## itarian subjug## ation to which all people## s to the east of the iron cur## tain we## re subject## ed . 
. 
the two Commission communic## ations on the common asy## lum policy are most welcome . 
the## y are intend## ed to ra## ise the standard of application of the current direct## ive## s in the EU , provid## ing for the possibil## ity of a review and to improve conditio## ns for the vast major## ity of refuge## es with## in the region the## y are flee## ing . 
I welcome these Commission propos## al## s intend## ed to improve the assess## ment process by adopt## ing a s## ing## le procedure , there## by simpl## ifying the process for bo## th the appli## cant and the administ## ration . 
improve## ments are to be introduce## d to train## ing , in @## -## @ country assess## ment and the relate## d inform## ation and judicial procedure## s . 
I also welcome the additional measure## s propos## ed , which offer the mean## s for manage## d , legal ent## ry in## to the EU , not least if the## y help to reduce traffick## ing in human be## ing## s , a## long with the intention to develop high @## -## @ qual## ity protection regime## s in receiv## ing countries . 
I can## not agree , how## ever , with some of the propos## al## s put forward by Mr## s Lamb## ert in her report and s## hall , there## fore , be vot## ing again## st . one of the main reason## s why I reject the report is that it plan## s to extend the s## cope of the Direct## ive on mini## mum standard## s for procedure## s 
. I support## ed , s## poke in favour and vot## ed in favour of J## ean Den## ise Lamb## ert &apos;## s report on asy## lum procedure and protection in region## s of origin ( 20## 04 / 21## 21 ( IN## I ) ) on A## s## y## lum . 
the overwhelm## ing major## ity of the report was posit## ive and in line with my own party policy . 
how## ever I have strong reserv## ations about point 19 when it states &apos; C## onsiders that a decisive common foreign and securit## y policy commit## ting the EU as a matter of priorit## y to the re## solution of long term## s conflict## s and conflict prevent## ion .## .. &quot; 
Sinn Féin believ## es that the EU through it## s member states must play a great## er role in conflict prevent## ion and re## solution and in promot## ing dia## logue and negoti## ation as an alter## native to milit## ary intervention . 
how## ever we are war## y of the move## s with## in the EU to## ward## s the development of a common foreign and securit## y policy as this would under## mine national sovereign## ty . 
the most appropriate vehicle for deal## ing with s## uch issue## s is through member state co## operation and under the au## spice## s of the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
the EU should play a more pro @## -## @ active role on conflict re## solution and prevent## ion with## in this con## text . 
. 
whi## lst we do not accept , and are in fact critical of , certain aspect## s of this EP initiative report , s## uch as it## s supranational out## look and it## s support for the common foreign and securit## y policy , we also appreci## ate it## s posit## ive aspect## s . 
we feel that , as part of the current poli## cies pursu## ed at EU level , this re## solution criticise## s ver## y mild## ly , and does not condemn clear## ly , the impact of the current EU asy## lum policy . 
it does , how## ever , a## mong other point## s , high## light this threat to &apos; the European human## itarian tradition &quot; and criticise## s what is term## ed the &apos; out## sourcing &quot; of the process of application by s## end## ing appli## cant## s for refuge## e status to a thir## d country , and condemn## s the length## y process## ing of asy## lum claim## s . 
the re## solution contain## s a number of point## s that we welcome , s## uch as it## s call for strict compliance with international standard## s , encompass## ing the principle that refuge## es may not be expel## led ( allow## ing the asy## lum seeker to enter the country in which the re## quest was ma## de ) ; the re## jection of any fund## ing for detention camp## s or any other centre restrict## ing asy## lum seeker## s &quot; personal free## dom ; and an end to the policy of repatri## ation and read## mission aim## ed at s## end## ing im## migrants back to the## ir countries of origin , as our group had propos## ed . 
hence our vot## e in favour . 
the report on asy## lum procedure and protection in region## s of origin is part of establish## ing the first s## tage of a common European asy## lum system , and the aim is to app## ly one and the same procedure to international protection in all the Member State## s . 
the Ju## ne List does not , how## ever , wish to contribut## e to any Fort## re## s## s Europe . an EU Member State must be able to conduct a gener## ous refuge## e policy if it wish## es to do s## o . 
we can## not there## fore support the report . 
- This report is a further step to## ward## s the adopt## ion of a s## ing## le asy## lum procedure . 
curi## ously , it does not app## ly s## ole## ly to political refuge## es , who should n## ever## the## less be the on## ly one## s entitle## d to app## ly for asy## lum under the Gene## va Convent## ion . 
it also appli## es to all of th## ose who might benefit from &apos; subsid## iary protection , &quot; that is th## ose who can## not return home be## cause of the general situ## ation in the## ir country of origin . 
the futur## e European asy## lum application procedure will there## fore cover all th## ose who wish to migrate . 
it is tru## e that in the border## less Europe of Bru## ssels there is a political tradition of system## atic## ally foster## ing im## migration . 
more## over , Paragraph 25 of the report states that we need , &apos; a common asy## lum procedure with## in the EU bas## ed upon high standard## s of deliver## y . &quot; 
this report on the right## s of migrants make## s no mention of illegal im## migrants , how## ever . 
further## more , the return policy is strict## ly define## d : the refusal to grant asy## lum ha## s to be du## ly reason## ed in writing in an &apos; authentic## ated document &quot; in the appli## cant &apos;## s own language , and it is not possible to use charter flight## s . 
in add## ition , the report rule## s out the possibil## ity of setting up detention centre## s in transit countries . 
. 
I wish to congratul## ate Mr## s Lamb## ert on her import## ant and time## ly report on asy## lum procedure and protection in region## s of origin . 
I endorse the report , in particular where it propos## es , in add## ition to the current European common asy## lum policy , the creation of measure## s bo## th to develop order## ly and better organise## d ent## ry in## to the EU of person## s in need of international protection and to step up protection capacity in the region## s of origin . 
the aim is there## fore to protect , at an ear## ly s## tage , political asy## lum seeker## s and refuge## es who , give## n the length## y process## ing of asy## lum claim## s , e## special## ly in cris## is situ## ations , may resort to illegal mean## s of travel , which may under## mine the## ir personal securit## y . 
statistic## s show that in 20## 03 some 70 % of the world &apos;## s refuge## es remain## ed in the## ir region of origin . 
it is there## fore essential to offer great## er protection of better qual## ity in th## ose region## s , but to be clear that this is in add## ition to the EU &apos;## s current respons## ibil## ities to offer protection under international agree## ments . 
. 
I welcome this report as it stress## es the need for a high qual## ity asy## lum procedure that act## s acquiesc## ent and compatible with the Gene## va Convent## ions in add## ition to other exist## ing international legal instrument## s . 
I am in agree## ment with this report where## by the speed and administ## rative efficiency are import## ant in assess## ing any system but the## y can## not be the on## ly crite## ria when people &apos;## s futur## es are at risk . 
I commend the report for recogn## izing that al## though the intention to develop high qual## ity protection regime## s in con## junction with receiv## ing countries is to be welcome## d but should not become a mean## s to enhance border control with the in## tent of prevent## ing people mov## ing on or a way of abdic## ating our own protection respons## ibil## ities . 
. 
I support## ed , s## poke in favour and vot## ed in favour of J## ean Den## ise Lamb## ert &apos;## s report on asy## lum procedure and protection in region## s of origin ( 20## 04 / 21## 21 ( IN## I ) ) on A## s## y## lum . 
the overwhelm## ing major## ity of the report was posit## ive and in line with my own party policy . 
how## ever I have strong reserv## ations about point 19 when it states &apos; C## onsiders that a decisive common foreign and securit## y policy commit## ting the EU as a matter of priorit## y to the re## solution of long term## s conflict## s and conflict prevent## ion ..## ..## ..... &apos; 
Sinn Féin believ## es that the EU through it## s member states must play a great## er role in conflict prevent## ion and re## solution and in promot## ing dia## logue and negoti## ation as an alter## native to milit## ary intervention . 
how## ever we are war## y of the move## s with## in the EU to## ward## s the development of a common foreign and securit## y policy as this would under## mine national sovereign## ty .

the EU should play a more pro @## -## @ active role on conflict re## solution and prevent## ion with## in this con## text . 
. 
my opinion of this report is bas## ed on the follow## ing main factor## s : 
on the one hand , I am in favour of some of the essential issue## s ra## ised , in particular where the report propos## es to establish universal standard## s for app## ly## ing exist## ing direct## ive## s , and advoc## ate## s im## prov## ing conditio## ns for the vast major## ity of refuge## es in the countries of origin . 
on the other hand , I disagree on a key point : the application of asy## lum procedure## s to other situ## ations of subsid## iary protection . 
in the end , I vot## ed again## st the report in light of the vot## e on certain amend## ments that I consider## ed fundamental . 
. 
the approach to issue## s re## l## ating to the grant## ing of asy## lum ha## s swung between two extreme perspective## s , n## either of which ha## s , in practice , prov## ed an effective mean## s of resolv## ing the problem . 
the truth is that n## either the con## cept of Fort## re## s## s Europe nor that of San## c## tu## ary Europe ha## s much to do with re## ality . 
the## y are bo## th caricature## s , distort## ions of a complex issue that is intrinsic## ally link## ed to people &apos;## s right## s and expect## ations and to the need to safeguard collect## ive securit## y and public order . 
at a time when the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice is be## ing consolidate## d , I feel that it is appropriate to address this issue and the role of countries of origin and of transit in the problem be## fore us . 
whi## lst I understand the gener## osity under## pinning the rapporteur &apos;## s propos## al , I can## not vot## e in favour of it , be## cause , as regard## s grant## ing refuge## e status , the propos## al does not on## ly deal with the case## s of individual## s - it widen## s the s## cope to subsid## iary protection , and this ra## ises doubt## s as to the appropriate## ness and proportion## ality of the propos## al . 
. - The ΕU want## s to re## move by all possible mean## s the victim## s of the intervention policy which it is follow## ing together with the US## A in a s## eries of countries . 
anti @## -## @ asy## lum legisl## ation , the in## human## e record number## s of asy## lum re## quest## s re## fuse## d and media## e## val liv## ing conditio## ns in im## migration centre## s we## re not en## ough . 
now it also aspi## re## s to keep any## one seek## ing asy## lum , seek## ing international protection , out## side the ΕU .

this report contain## s propos## al## s and word## ing## s that reflect a liberal att## itude to## ward## s drug## s . 
we are thu## s vot## ing again## st the propos## al . 
we are oppose## d to drug## s be## ing class## ified as &apos; soft &quot; or &apos; hard &quot; and to the fact that drug## s describ## ed as &apos; soft &quot; are not regard## ed as addict## ive . 
the &apos; alter## native policy &quot; re## commend## ed in the report involve## s a more liberal policy to## ward## s drug## s , emphasis## ing harm reduction measure## s again## st drug use , ra## ther th## an prevent## ive work . 
we are oppose## d to a common EU drug## s policy . s## uch a policy would involve countries with a restrict## ive drug## s policy , s## uch as Swede## n , be## ing force## d to conduct a more leni## ent and liberal drug## s policy . 
it is up to e## ach national Parliament in the EU to make decision## s concern## ing the## ir national drug## s poli## cies . 
- Drug con## sumpt## ion is on the increas## e through## out Europe . 
a## round 7## .000 people di## e of overdo## s## es every year in the European Union , and three time## s as man## y di## e as an in## direct result of drug abuse ( su## icide , viol## ence , AIDS , road accident## s , and s## o on ) . 
it appear## s that Bru## ssels wish## es to tackle this scourge . 
great , except that what it is propos## ing in the fight again## st drug## s is not to prevent young people from taking drug## s or to give drug addict## s the mean## s to come clean , but to make drug addict## ion more hygien## ic . 
for ex## ample , it ha## s table## d propos## al## s for recover## y room## s , room## s for inject## ing hero## in under super## vision and need## le exchange programme## s . 
we can## not accept s## uch a policy . 
prevent## ion is of course essential in the fight again## st drug## s , but s## o is repress## ion . 
we should increas## e the penal## ties for drug dealer## s and introduce court order## s for medical follow @## -## @ up## s for us## ers . 
final## ly , we should not draw a distinct## ion between soft drug## s and hard drug## s , as n## either are harm## less . 
more## over , this over @## -## @ simpl## istic class## ification ha## s led to a consider## able increas## e in can## na## bi## s con## sumpt## ion . 
we must not forget that there is scientific evidence link## ing the use of these drug## s and mental health , with the occur## rence of schizophrenia be## ing between 30 % and 50 % high## er in can## na## bi## s us## ers . 
. 
I take the view that negoti## ations with Tur## key should start as s## oon as Tur## key com## plies with the political C## open## hagen crite## ria , for ex## ample in relation to the protection of human and women &apos;## s right## s , the combat## ing of corrupt## ion , the punish## ment of torture and the outlaw## ing of child labour . 
Tur## key ha## s ma## de impress## ive progress in these area## s , but it is ap## parent from the report## s by non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s that it ha## s not y## et achiev## ed these object## ive## s . 
the negoti## ations will be commence## d with a view to acquir## ing Member State status , but if the conclusion seem## s appropriate that member## ship is not feasible , other form## s of co## operation are possible . 
. this is a commend## able attempt to draw attention to the EU &apos;## s increas## ing Drug problem and find solution## s us## ing a scientific and practical approach . 
step## s to combat the drug## s trade would threaten one of the most import## ant source## s of in## come for organise## d crime and terrorist organisation## s . 
for ex## ample , accord## ing to the Euro## pol report on organise## d crime , drug## s production and traffick## ing continu## e to be the main activity pursu## ed by criminal group## s in the EU . 
no other field of organise## d crime is quit## e s## o profit## able . 
I welcome the view that a Comm## un## ity project should be launch## ed for the purpose of introdu## c## ing alter## native form## s of detention , s## o that drug## s repress## ion cease## s to focus exclus## ive## ly on imprison## ment . 
the anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy should be regard## ed as a form of social intervention concentr## ating on the reason## s for social un## rest with a view to prevent## ing drug## s use by re## fin## ing a strate## gy of repress## ion which is current## ly target## ed s## ole## ly at drug us## ers . 
. 
the European Parliament## ary Lab## our Part## y vot## ed for the Cata## nia report on the EU drug## s strate## gy be## cause we believ## e it provid## es a comprehens## ive approach to tack## ling the harm done by particular drug## s to individual## s and to the spiral of crime , viol## ence and traffick## ing cause## d by the trade in particular sub## stance## s . 
it address## es harm reduction , addict## ion and crime . 
on Amendment 2 concern## ing the issue of the distribut## ion of particular sub## stance## s under control## led circum## stance## s , the EP## LP vot## ed again## st bo## th part## s be## cause we do not believ## e this amend## ment enhance## s the report or is in line with the UK Govern## ment &apos;## s drug## s strate## gy , which the EP## LP fully support## s . 
. 
the issue be## fore us is the EU &apos;## s anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy that the Council decide## d to establish in Ju## ne 20## 04 and that is set to be adopt## ed at the next European Council . 
this report go## es again## st the gra## in of the EU &apos;## s fundamental con## cept## s , as it cho## ose## s to take the view that the strate## gy current## ly be## ing implement## ed is not bear## ing fruit , that in some case## s it ha## s violate## d citizen## s &quot; right## s and , accord## ing## ly , that a different path must be follow## ed ; it even suggest## s that some drug## s should be de## criminal## ised . 
further## more - and this make## s sense with## in the log## ic of the report - it take## s the view that the subsid## i## arity principle is not ver## y import## ant in this area . 
this is not my understand## ing of what the anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy ought to be . I there## fore vot## ed again## st . 
. 
the fact that this report was pass## ed s## o narrow## ly in the committee concern## ed show## s that the rapporteur devi## ated from the European Strategy again## st drug## s , by propos## ing a solution that , to my mind , does not solv## e the problem , but ra## ther exacerb## ate## s it . 
it is nothing new in this House to see Member## s try to put liberal## isation forward as a solution , to see the not## ion of damage limit## ation as the be @## -## @ all @## -## @ and @## -## @ end @## -## @ all and to s## peak the language of surrender when it come## s to drug traffick## ing . 
this practice al## read## y ha## s a not## able histo## ry , with the common th## read be## ing that it is up to the Member State## s to enforce it - at complete vari## ance with the subsid## i## arity principle , which must continu## e to app## ly to this issue - de## spite the need to co## ordinate the fight again## st drug## s . 
the s## lack## ness and de## criminal## isation that have be## en propos## ed are well known ways of re## mov## ing respons## ibility from the public author## ities and are a false ally of th## ose who## s## e drive and judgment have be## en sub## du## ed by the effect## s of drug## s , and there## fore constitut## e a deep## ly flaw## ed mess## age to give to the young## est member## s of soci## ety . 
it is ironic that the rapporteur cite## s fundamental right## s and claim## s to fight again## st an &apos; ideo## logical approach &quot; to this subject , in order to just## ify a high## ly ideo## logical position that , strict## ly s## peak## ing , run## s counter to basic fundamental right## s . 
- On 16 and 17 Dec## ember , the Council will decide on the new European Union Anti @## -## @ Drug## s Strategy for 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 12 . 
a political agree## ment ha## s al## read## y be## en reach## ed in the Council , with no trans## par## ency or democratic scrutin## y by Parliament . 
in## de## ed the Council ha## s be## en ver## y reluctant to meet our repeat## ed demand## s for inform## ation about the progress of negoti## ations , even though we we## re discuss## ing the same issue in the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s . 
today I vot## ed in favour of Mr Cata## nia &apos;## s report , be## cause the European Parliament ha## s to show the Council what it## s vision of the new anti @## -## @ drug## s strate## gy is for the year## s to come . 
we note that the European strate## gy ha## s achiev## ed li## ttle to d## ate , and at the same time , drug use ha## s increas## ed in Europe . 
we there## fore want to step up co## ordination and co## operation at European level s## o that Europe can bring add## ed value to the fight again## st the scourge of drug## s while respect## ing the principle of subsid## i## arity . 
we must final## ly make the protection and health of drug us## ers a priorit## y . 
we must there## fore step up prevent## ion , provid## e better care and enhance health policy s## o as to avoid human trage## dies and reduce exclus## ion . 
. - The European Parliament re## commend## ation ha## s not take## n account of the re## cent annual report of the European Mon## ito## ring Centre for Drug## s and Drug Addi## tion , which demolish## es the s## o @## -## @ call## ed Dutch experiment and the argument that can## na## bi## s is alleg## ed## ly harm## less . 
in the name of a non @## -## @ exist## ent real## ism , the re## commend## ation distort## s the nature of the problem from a social to a medical problem , some## thing which result## s in sub## mission and defeat## ism . 
the rapporteur endeavour## s to achiev## e the general application of the Dutch experiment through the back door , adopt## ing the danger## ous approach of divid## ing drug## s in## to soft and hard . 
he use## s the word &apos; consum## ers &apos; in## stead of victim## s / us## ers and propos## es the creation of official drug administ## ration centre## s . 
as a con## sequenc## e of this danger## ous approach , all the propos## al## s which detract from the prim## ary concern - prevent## ion - focus on damage limit## ation ( substitution programme## s ) and look for solution## s in the mechan## ism## s and resource## s of the ΕU . 
the connect## ion between drug traffick## ing and the fund## ing of s## o @## -## @ call## ed terrorism give## s argument## s to imperial## ist propag## anda and is be## coming an alibi be## fore the people . 
we do not demonst## rate any tolerance of the drug culture . 
the reason## s for drug addict## ion can## not be divid## ed in## to &apos; hard &apos; and &apos; soft &apos; . 
prevent## ive and therapeutic measure## s and measure## s to re## integrate us## ers are need## ed , together with a move## ment which will fight to over## turn the social cause## s and the barbar## ic policy of capital## ism which lead## s to drug## s .

Madam President , I would like to make a personal statement pursu## ant to the provision## s of Rule 14## 5 . 
in view of the fact that a Member of the European Parliament ha## s be## en gross## ly insult## ed , I have submit## ted a re## quest to the President of the European Parliament to conduct an enquir## y in## to inform## ation , which ha## s be## en de## liberate## ly circul## ated in my country , Latvia , concern## ing my activities here at the European Parliament . 
an employ## ee at the Green Group secretariat ha## s spread this false inform## ation . 
he ha## s voice## d the opinion in mass media public## ations that my activities arouse## d s## uch in## dign## ation a## mong## st Member## s of the European Parliament that , in protest again## st me and my personal view## s , the## y left the Chamber . 
this person describ## ed my account## s of my activities at the European Parliament as lies . 
Madam President , non## e of this inform## ation is tru## e . 
I there## fore re## quest the leader## ship of the European Parliament to investig## ate this incident and to rein## state the truth about my European Parliament activities . 
a Member of the European Parliament &apos;## s job and du## ty is to work in the common interest## s of European demo## cracy , truth and development . 
every employ## ee ha## s these same du## ties regard## less of the## ir political convict## ions . 
spread## ing lies or allow## ing them to be spread not on## ly fail## s to promot## e the principle of legal## ity , human right## s and justice , but also discredit## s the European Parliament and it## s Member## s . 
this can## not be permit## ted . 
I re## quest an investig## ation of these incident## s .

- The next item is the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 65 / 20## 04 ) by Mr Van Or## den on Bulgaria &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion ( COM ( 20## 04 ) 06## 57 - C## 6 @## -## @ 01## 50 / 20## 04 - 20## 04 / 21## 83 ( IN## I ) ) . 
. Madam President , it is al## most nine year## s to the day since Bulgaria formal## ly appli## ed for member## ship of the European Union . 
since th## en the country ha## s under## gone tremend## ous political and economic change## s : it be## came a member of NA## TO ear## lier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
I see no significant obstacle## s to this and I trust that the European Council , when it meet## s at the end of this week , will not on## ly endorse this view but also set a d## ate ear## ly in the new year for sign## ature of the Access## ion Treat## y . 
Bulgaria must be judge## d on it## s own merit## s and it## s progress should not necess## arily be link## ed to that of any other candid## ate country . 
that is why a separat## e Access## ion Treat## y for Bulgaria may be necess## ary . 
let us look at some of the change## s that have take## n place in Bulgaria . 
on the one hand we can recognis## e that the access## ion crite## ria and dead## line## s set by the European Commission have provid## ed an external catalys## t for change . 
how## ever , on the other hand , internal dynamic## s have great## ly alter## ed the political and social landscape in Bulgaria as it cast off it## s old man## tle follow## ing the collapse of commun## ism in 19## 90 . 
these change## s are taking place not just be## cause the European Union is insist## ing on them , but be## cause the## y are good for Bulgaria and the## y are what the Bulgaria## ns them## selves want . 
Bulgaria is now a fully function## ing market econom## y and ha## s be## en recognis## ed as s## uch since 20## 02 . 
macro## economic st## ability ha## s be## en maintain## ed , including adequate price st## ability and sustain## able public finance## s and external account## s . 
to take just a coup## le of key economic indic## ators , Bulgaria &apos;## s G## DP grew by 6 per cent in the first quarter of 20## 04 , up from 4.3 per cent in 20## 03 , and one of the high## est rates a## mong EU candid## ate## s and new Member State## s . 
the un## employ## ment rate ha## s consist## ent## ly fall## en since 20## 02 : at 12 per cent it is s## till too high , but it is fall## ing . 
foreign direct invest## ment is at record level## s this year . 
enormous progress ha## s also be## en ma## de on privat## isation : 80 per cent of the econom## y is now in the privat## e sector . 
I strong## ly support the on## going reform of Bulgaria &apos;## s public administ## ration , with the adopt## ion of amend## ments to the Civil Service law . 
improve## ments have also be## en ma## de in the judicial system : there have be## en posit## ive development## s with regard to the recruit## ment and appoint## ment of judge## s . 
how## ever , more need## s to be done , in particular in relation to pre @## -## @ trial procedure## s and the position of the Prosecutor General . 
how## ever , it is not now just plain s## ailing . 
there are s## till area## s of concern that I have be## en high## light## ing since 19## 99 . 
organise## d crime and corrupt## ion are an obstacle to reform in Bulgaria , having knock @## -## @ on effect## s in all sector## s of the econom## y and soci## ety . 
I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resource## s to be target## ed to bring about major improve## ments in the wel## fare of child## ren and in child## care institution## s . 
I have call## ed for a well @## -## @ resource## d , s## ing## le govern## ment age## ncy , with the power to ensu## re that child wel## fare reform happen## s . 
the same strategic approach must be adopt## ed for the integration of the Roma communit## y in## to Bulgaria## n soci## ety . 
Bulgaria , assist## ed by the European Commission , must make an even more determine## d ef## fort to expedite the integration of Roma in## to mainstream soci## ety , particular## ly through educational and employ## ment opportun## ities , improve## d liv## ing conditio## ns and access to health## care and fami## ly plan## ning . 
there is also an## other side to this problem : the Roma them## selves must adapt . 
this point may be un## popular in some circl## es but it is the on## ly way that real change will be br## ought about on the ground for the Roma . 
over the past four year## s over EUR 1## 60 million of Comm## un## ity fund## s have be## en direct## ed at Roma issue## s . 
how## ever , change must happen from the in## side as well as on the part of govern## ment . 
the European Union &apos;## s enlarge## ment to the east and south @## -## @ east mark## s a moment## ous change in Europe . 
we have final## ly put an end to the hostil## ities and the division## s of the Col## d War . 
histo## ry is be## ing written as we s## peak - in Ukraine , for in## stance - and this morning Parliament ga## ve it## s green light to the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
great change## s are taking place on our continent . 
we are in a time of transit## ion and we must all work hard to ensu## re that the tide of change shift## s in the right direct## ion . 
with## in Europe this mean## s re## focus## ing the nature and object## ive## s of the European Union . 
this mean## s the EU do## ing less but do## ing it better . 
I wish to thank colleague## s a## cross Parliament for the## ir support and assist## ance in my work as rapporteur . 
there will be an opportun## ity for a more comprehens## ive report on Bulgaria &apos;## s access## ion ear## ly in the new year . 
my report this time is de## liberate## ly concise . 
some amend## ments we## re include## d d## uring the committee s## tage , but I do not feel that I can support any of the amend## ments now propos## ed . 
final## ly , I wish to take this opportun## ity to high## light the p## light of Bulgaria## n nurse## s incarce## rated in Lib## ya and now under threat of the death penal## ty . 
I urge all Member## s to sign Writ## ten De## clar## ation No 61 call## ing for the## ir ear## ly re## lease . 
Bulgaria know## s the challenge## s that lie a## head . 
on 17 Dec## ember I trust the European Council will formal## ly conclude Bulgaria &apos;## s negoti## ations and set the d## ate for sign## ature of the Access## ion Treat## y in spring 20## 05 . 
this will be a great achiev## e## ment , but reform and change must continu## e bo## th in Bulgaria and in the EU it## self . 
. Madam President , it is a great pleas## ure to be able to inform you formal## ly that on 13 Dec## ember 20## 04 the General Affair## s Council closed the negoti## ations with Bulgaria . 
we will now start the last , ver## y import## ant phase be## fore enter## ing the EU . 
the remain## ing two year## s should be us## ed to prepar## e thorough## ly for member## ship . 
the EU c## ongratulates Bulgaria on this posit## ive result , which ha## s take## n much ef## fort and energ## y . 
it is a new step to## ward## s a tru## ly reunite## d Europe , bas## ed on mutual## ly accept## ed principle## s of demo## cracy and the rule of law . 
the negoti## ations with Bulgaria closed at the technical level in Ju## ne 20## 04 . 
this reflect## s the progress that the Bulgaria## n Govern## ment ha## s ma## de in re## cent year## s , which result## ed in strong con## fidence on the part of all th## ose involve## d and the ability to assume all member## ship oblig## ations by Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
s## till , as the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s also states clear## ly in it## s motion for an EP re## solution on Bulgaria &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion , we should close## ly monitor the progress which s## till ha## s to be ma## de by Bulgaria . 
the commit## ments ma## de in the Just## ice and Home Affair## s chap## ter might need an amend## ment of the Constitution , which is a long and difficult process . 
other import## ant area## s , as the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s states , are the qual## ity of border manage## ment , the fight again## st corrupt## ion , and the prevent## ion of abuse of power## s by State author## ities again## st person## s enter## ing or transit## ing Bulgaria . 
the new penal code s## till ha## s to be approve## d . 
administ## rative capacity in a number of area## s , including the age## ncies involve## d with the use of pre @## -## @ access## ion fund## s , should improve . 
bo## th in Bulgaria and in Roman## ia , improve## ments in the standard of liv## ing should be a priorit## y . 
the economic grow## th that Bulgaria and Roman## ia have seen in re## cent year## s ha## s had a posit## ive effect on pur## cha## s## ing power , but the effect## s at grass @## -## @ root## s level , e## special## ly for the elder## ly , have remain## ed limit## ed . 
there are at least two more year## s to go be## fore access## ion . 
an histo## ric step will be ma## de on 17 Dec## ember when the negoti## ations regard## ing the fifth enlarge## ment have come to an end . 
monitor## ing of the last part of the fifth enlarge## ment will continu## e until 20## 07 , in order to welcome the two new , long @## -## @ await## ed member## s th## en read## y to join the European Union . 
as Mr## s Kuneva s## aid in October , s## he would like to publish the Mon## ito## ring Report on a big wall in Sofia in order to keep the process going . 
I think Bulgaria ha## s ma## de good progress , which give## s us con## fidence for the numer## ous task## s s## till remain## ing . 
the Council look## s forward to the final## isation of the Access## ion Treat## y with a view to it## s sign## ature in spring 20## 05 , after the Treat## y ha## s be## en submit## ted to the European Parliament . 
. 
Madam President , we have come a long way since Bulgaria appli## ed for EU member## ship in 19## 95 and open## ed it## s negoti## ations in 20## 00 . 
yesterday the EU final## ised the access## ion negoti## ations with Bulgaria in the access## ion conference , with a view to access## ion on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 and with the sign## ature of the access## ion Treat## y in sight in the spring of next year . 
I would like to thank the European Parliament for it## s const## ant and balance## d support for Bulgaria &apos;## s ambit## ion to accede to the European Union and I would also like to congratul## ate the rapporteur , Mr Van Or## den , for the sound and even @## -## @ hand## ed report he ha## s produce## d . 
in the past few year## s Bulgaria ha## s ma## de stead## y progress in all area## s in it## s prepar## ation for access## ion and for meet## ing the C## open## hagen crite## ria . 
import## ant and necess## ary decision## s have be## en take## n in this respect . 
four unit## s of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant are be## ing closed on agree## d d## ate## s for final de## commission## ing , show## ing Bulgaria &apos;## s de## termination to respect commit## ments . 
substanti## al support from the Union is be## ing provid## ed as assist## ance to these ef## fort## s . 
over## all , Bulgaria ha## s consolidate## d and deepen## ed the st## ability of it## s institution## s . 
continu## ation on it## s current reform path should en## able the country to cope with competitive pressure## s and market force## s with## in the European Union . 
we will , how## ever , need to keep a close watch on some area## s . 
our intention now is to intens## ify our monitor## ing of the commit## ments that have be## en ma## de and of continu## ing prepar## ations in general , in order to ensu## re that progress continu## es after the closure of negoti## ations and that Bulgaria will be effective## ly read## y for member## ship in 20## 07 . 
in this regard , solid ef## fort## s remain necess## ary concern## ing the reform of the judic## iary , the fight again## st organise## d crime and the fight again## st corrupt## ion . 
Bulgaria ha## s ma## de progress in gradual## ly build## ing up it## s administ## rative capacity but further ef## fort## s remain necess## ary in this regard in a number of area## s . 
as from N## ov## ember 20## 05 the Commission will issue year## ly comprehens## ive monitor## ing report## s for the Council and Parliament follow## ing the same method## ology as was appli## ed to the new Member State## s that join## ed the Union in May 20## 04 . 
these report## s will focus particular## ly on public administ## ration , the judic## iary and the fight again## st corrupt## ion , as well as the track record in economic reform## s . 
it is also necess## ary to take account of a long## er period between comp## let## ion of the negoti## ations and the effective d## ate of access## ion th## an in pre## vi## ous wave## s of access## ion . 
a specific safeguard was agree## d , which allow## s the Commission to re## commend to the Council to decide by un## anim## ity , at any time , to postpone the d## ate of access## ion by one year to Janu## ary 20## 08 if there is clear evidence that Bulgaria is manifest## ly un## prepar## ed . 
let me conclude by say## ing that I share the conclusion## s of the report of your rapporteur , Mr Van Or## den , which are , by and large , in line with the 20## 04 regular report . 
the Commission will continu## e to keep the European Parliament inform## ed of Bulgaria &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion . 
Bulgaria is on track for access## ion on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
with the access## ion of Bulgaria and Roman## ia , the fifth round of EU enlarge## ment will be conclude## d . 
thu## s the B## lack Sea will become a new coast## line for an enlarge## d and un## ified Europe . 
. 
Madam President , as draft## s## man of the opinion of the Committee on Budget## s , I would like to begin by point## ing out that the financial pre @## -## @ access## ion aid grant## ed to Bulgaria d## uring 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 04 ha## s amount## ed to approximate## ly EUR 1## 78 million per year from the PH## AR## E Pro## gramme , SAP## A## RD and the ISP## A instrument . 
the Committee on Budget## s also support## s an additional s## um from the PH## AR## E Pro## gramme of EUR 200 million for 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 06 for the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station . 
it is also pleas## ed that in Spring 20## 04 a new fund## ing frame## work was establish## ed for Bulgaria and that the Commission ha## s adopt## ed a consist## ent approach by restrict## ing the aid package to a period of three year## s from the access## ion of Bulgaria in 20## 07 s## o that we can adapt it to any futur## e reform## s of poli## cies which may be necess## ary as a result of the new financial perspective## s . 
the Committee on Budget## s stress## es o## nce again that financial aid will depend on the new financial perspective## s , but also on the adapt## ation of the annual Budget , in accord## ance with th## ose financial perspective## s . 
. Madam President , un## like Tur## key , Bulgaria is quit## e clear## ly a European country which ha## s ma## de tremend## ous progress . 
I was in Bulgaria in 19## 90 , when the country first attempt## ed to hold free elect## ions . 
there was s## till some elect## ion @## -## @ rigg## ing , but the demo## cracy move## ment was impress## ive . 
in man## y ways , it was reminis## cent of the current situ## ation in Ukraine . 
Bulgaria ha## s succeed## ed , step by step , in over## coming these cris## is situ## ations , and must now be take## n serious## ly as a ver## y prom## ising candid## ate for access## ion to the European Union . 
it ha## s a rich culture and exert## s a major stabilis## ing influence over the entire Balkan peninsula . 
al## though there is s## till a great deal to do - e## special## ly on the rule of law , justice and administ## ration , where further reform## s are require## d - Bulgaria is by far the most advance## d of all the candid## ate countries , un## less , that is , we forget a country which we should n## ever forget , name## ly Croatia . 
I would like to take this opportun## ity to appeal also to the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council to accept Croatia at the forth## coming summit with## out any prevaric## ation or special conditio## ns , and to make mass## ive ef## fort## s to ensu## re that the negoti## ations with Croatia are open## ed with## out delay . 
bo## th these countries should become member## s of the European Union be## fore the deca## de is out , and Mr Van Or## den &apos;## s excel## lent report make## s a major contribut## ion to this process . 
one of Bulgaria &apos;## s particular achiev## e## ments is the cross @## -## @ party co## operation establish## ed between Pr## ime Minister S## axe @## -## @ Co## burg @## -## @ Got## ha and the Bulgaria## n President , which is a pre## requisite en## ab## ling Bulgaria to bring it## s progress to## ward## s EU member## ship to a success## ful conclusion in the coming year## s . 
Bulgaria enjoy## s democratic st## ability at domestic level and is remain## ing resolute de## spite the cris## es affect## ing a number of area## s , including the econom## y . 
I would like to say how grat## ified I am by this development , and that Bulgaria is well on track . 
I could s## um up my speech in a s## ing## le word : &apos; y## es &quot; to Bulgaria . 
. I would like to congratul## ate Mr van Or## den on hi## s out## standing report , which I believ## e is the fruit of much hard work , and I would like to thank the Commission &apos;## s excel## lent work done with regard to candid## ate countries . 
technical## ly , Bulgaria ha## s complete## d all the access## ion negoti## ation chap## ter## s and is clear## ly head## ed to## ward## s be## coming a full member of the European Union in Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
accord## ing to the report , Bulgaria continu## es to ful## fil the C## open## hagen crite## ria and the measure## s take## n to success## fully implement them have be## en effective . 
how## ever , this report also emphasis## es that there are s## till defi## ci## encies that will inevit## ably have to be deal## t with . 
we believ## e that Bulgaria is on track for access## ion and will continu## e to make ef## fort## s to complete success## fully the reform## s it commit## ted it## self to in the near futur## e . 
these main## ly include judicial reform and further increas## ed ef## fort## s to counter organise## d crime and corrupt## ion . 
the report welcome## s posit## ive change## s implement## ed in the field of minor## ity right## s , as a result of which the s## o @## -## @ call## ed legisl## ation on anti @## -## @ discrimin## ation was adopt## ed on Janu## ary 1 , 20## 04 . 
the report also emphasis## es the import## ance of the legisl## ature &apos;## s practical extens## ion , as discrimin## ation again## st Roman## y people remain## s wide## spread there . 
the report acknowledg## es Bulgaria meet## ing the economic crite## ria and note## s that it is a function## ing market econom## y and at the time of access## ion will be able to cope with competitive pressure and market force## s with## in the Union . 
the European Parliament and the Socialist Group will continu## e the monitor## ing system while ens## uring that operation## s are run efficient## ly and oblig## ations are fulfill## ed . 
bas## ed on Bulgaria &apos;## s reform ef## fort## s and progress , the Socialist Group hope## s that Bulgaria will sign and rat## ify the access## ion treat## y as s## oon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 20## 07 . 
. 
Madam President , Commission## er , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , lad## ies and gentle## men , my group also view## s Bulgaria &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion as a success story , albeit with a few necess## ary caveat## s on point## s of detail . 
we there## fore believ## e that this House can vot## e in favour of Bulgaria access## ion to the European Union in 20## 07 with a clear con## science . 
we support Mr Van Or## den &apos;## s report and s## peak## ing personal## ly , I would like to thank him and Mr## s Do## bo## ly## i from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the good co## operation . 
as Mr Van Or## den him## self ha## s s## aid , he ha## s de## liberate## ly kept the report brief . 
I there## fore suggest that we discuss all the other table## d amend## ments , some of which are ver## y detail## ed , next year when we deal with the long## er report which will th## en be due . 
Bulgaria is well on track to join the European Union in 20## 07 . 
I would there## fore like to take this opportun## ity to high## light a fundamental problem , name## ly that of genuine compliance with the principle of merit . 
the Commission and the Council have bo## th stated that e## ach candid## ate &apos;## s access## ion should be bas## ed on individual merit . 
how## ever , this is in## compatible with a situ## ation in which a candid## ate country which ful## fil## s the crite## ria is held back by the s## lower progress ma## de by other countries . 
the countries making swift## er progress thu## s accede too late while the candid## ate## s making s## lower progress join too ear## ly . 
to put it simpl## y , the good perform## ers are be## ing penal## ised while the lagg## ard## s are be## ing reward## ed . 
this situ## ation must change . 
the cred## ibility of the Union as a whole is damage## d if it## s practice## s conflict with the principle of merit . 
Commission## er Ver## heugen amp## ly demonst## rated this with the &apos; big bang &apos; enlarge## ment in May this year , which damage## d the Union . 
a better opt## ion would have be## en for well @## -## @ perform## ing candid## ate## s , s## uch as Estonia and Slovenia , to have be## en able to join much ear## lier . 
for this reason al## one , name## ly to pre## serve the European Union &apos;## s cred## ibility and not be## cause there is any doubt about the European prospect of either of the two candid## ate## s , my group ha## s al## ways be## en in favour of separat## e access## ion treat## ies for Bulgaria and Roman## ia . 
Mr Wat## son re## affirm## ed this position this morning in this Chamber . 
I there## fore urge the Commission and the Council , but also my fellow Member## s in this House , to ensu## re , d## uring present and futur## e enlarge## ment round## s , that the principle of merit is not just proclaim## ed with pomp and ceremony , on## ly to be ignor## ed in favour of package deal## s , but is actual## ly implement## ed in practice . 
in this con## text , a grat## ifying sign is the Council &apos;## s decision to adopt different## iated approach## es to Bulgaria and Roman## ia in the chap## ter## s on competit## ion and justice . 
simpl## ifying the mechan## ism to invoke the safeguard clause in the case of Roman## ia will enhance the cred## ibility of the access## ion process and thu## s the cred## ibility of the European Union it## self . 
on a more general note , I believ## e that we should be conduct## ing this debate not in Strasbourg , but in Bru## ssels . 
. Madam President , Bulgaria will become a Member State with man## y un## resolv## ed issue## s . 
old environment## al problem## s , result## ing from min## ing and nuclear waste , are s## till left un## resolv## ed . 
much damage is be## ing done by construct## ion work for new road## s through protect## ed s## ce## nic area## s and by the expansion of the large## st air## port . 
these days , poor main## ten## ance , decay and p## over## ty are notice## able through## out Bulgaria . 
the Roma people are s## till lagg## ing be## hind and dis## advantage## d . 
EU fund## ing for the benefit of project## s for this group of people is divid## ed and spent in a content## ious mann## er . 
in the mind## s of man## y Bulgaria## ns , the near## by Greek and Roman coast## s belong , in fact , to Bulgaria , just as do the great## er part of the Republic of Macedonia and a few area## s on the border with Serb## ia . 
the fact that the Bulgaria## n elector## ate s## till ha## s not ma## de any stead## y cho## ice## s is ap## parent from the rapid change## s with## in the two main rival## ling political part## ies , and , above all , from the fact that a newcomer to the most re## cent general elect## ions achiev## ed al## most the major## ity of the vot## es . 
short## ly after the surprising elect## ion as Pr## ime Minister of the country &apos;## s former K## ing , the candid## ate of the Communist## s &quot; success## ors was elect## ed President . 
this inst## ability ha## s , how## ever , produce## d one posit## ive development in the form of great## er involve## ment in political decision @## -## @ making of the Turk## ish minor## ity , which was discrimin## ated again## st in the past . 
un## like in Roman## ia , the problem## s in Bulgaria are no big## ger th## an th## ose in a number of the present EU Member State## s . 
that is why it is right to allow Bulgaria full EU member## ship from 20## 07 . 
there is a strong historical and linguist## ic bond between Bulgaria and the Slav## onic @## -## @ s## peak## ing part of Macedonia . 
in 18## 78 , last @## -## @ minute Western European intervention prevent## ed the two from unit## ing . 
it would be use## ful if the negoti## ations about Macedonia &apos;## s access## ion - for which the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s ha## s appoint## ed me as rapporteur - we## re to run parallel with Croatia , which also ha## s it## s root## s in former Yugoslav## ia , s## o that we can welcome the Bulgaria## ns and Macedonia## ns to the European Union simultaneous## ly . 
- Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I hope Mr Po## s## s## elt will praise me as well short## ly . 
I am not over## ly keen on the black @## -## @ and @## -## @ white film present## ed by the European Commission entitle## d &apos; Roman## ia the bad and Bulgaria the good . &quot; 
black @## -## @ and @## -## @ white film## s are not popular either in politic## s or in real life . 
not every## thing is as bad in Roman## ia and as good in Bulgaria as would appear from the picture paint## ed by the European Commission &apos;## s amateur art## ists . 
it is tru## e that Bulgaria ha## s ma## de progress and that it should join the European Union on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
at the same time , how## ever , Bulgaria ha## s not done man## y of the thing## s it should have done . 
I should like to refer to a number of specific point## s . 
first## ly , what use is there in Bulgaria## n legisl## ation comp## ly## ing with EU legisl## ation , if implement## ation of this legisl## ation continu## es to lag be## hind ? 
second## ly , trade in human be## ing## s , in particular in women and child## ren , is s## till a serious problem . 
as a thir## d point , the adopt## ion system and it## s lack of trans## par## ency , as well as the situ## ation in Bulgaria## n orphan## age## s and special school## s , continu## e to be a cause for concern . 
four## th## ly , there are also concern## s with regard to the situ## ation of adult## s in psychia## tric hospital## s , and this is include## d in Parliament &apos;## s motion for a re## solution . 
as a fifth point , the continu## ing lack of reform of the judicial system , which lag## s a long way be## hind European standard## s , is an Achil## les &quot; heel for Sofia . 
the six## th point I should like to refer to is the wide## spread corrupt## ion , which is a thorn in Bulgaria &apos;## s side as it enter## s the EU , give## n that it affect## s vari## ous area## s and level## s of govern## ment and is ap## parent at every turn . 
d## uring the past few week## s I have visit## ed Bulgaria twi## ce , and my remark## s are by no mean## s mer## e## ly quote## s from report## s , but reflect what is plain for every## one to see . 
the seven## th point is organise## d crime . 
the Bulgaria## n Govern## ment is acting like the cho## ir in a Chi## nes## e opera , where the cho## ir s## ing## s &apos; let &apos;## s run away , let &apos;## s run away &quot; for three act## s , but stay## s in the same place the whole time . 
the Bulgaria## n Govern## ment const## ant## ly repeat## s that it is taking measure## s to fight the mafia , but it would appear that it is main## ly conduct## ing a war of word## s . 
the mafia continu## es to be a serious problem . 
at the same time , how## ever , the EU also some## time## s take## s measure## s that the Bulgaria## n public find## s in## comprehens## ible . 
for ex## ample , it re## cent## ly demand## ed that a power plant in Ko## z## lo## du## j be shut down , even though enormous amount## s of Bulgaria## n tax## payer## s &quot; money had be## en spent on modern## ising it in re## cent year## s . 
in conclusion , Madam President , lad## ies and gentle## men , de## spite these reserv## ations we should welcome the fact that our European fami## ly is to be join## ed by a nation with a histo## ry d## ating back over 13## 00 year## s . 
Bulgaria &apos;## s histo## ry is long## er th## an man## y of the present EU Member State## s . 
I should like to bid Bulgaria welcome to some## where it should have be## en for man## y year## s . 
I am s## ure Bulgaria will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of home## land## s . 
- Madam President , I should like by way of introdu## ction to make the member## s of the European Parliament priv## y to the host## age @## -## @ taking in A## th## ens today , to the hijack## ing of a bus with innoc## ent citizen## s on the## ir way to work . 
I mention this in order to high## light the need to formulate an efficient policy at European level on urban securit## y . 
now to the subject in hand . 
Bulgaria ma## de note## worthy progress in convert## ing to a plural## istic demo## cracy and function## al market econom## y in keeping with European instruct## ions at bo## th political and economic level . 
the integration of Bulgaria in## to the European Union in 20## 07 , in con## junction with it## s re## cent admiss## ion to ΝΑΤΟ , is a particular## ly posit## ive development bo## th for Bulgaria it## self and for south @## -## @ eastern Europe as a whole . 
I trust that the case of Bulgaria will also set an ex## ample for the countries of the Western Balkan## s as the## y move to## ward## s Europe . 
non## e## the## less , it should be point## ed out that there need## s to be a const## ant and conscious ef## fort on the part of the Bulgaria## n author## ities to adapt pend## ing full integration . 
further ef## fort## s should focus on stamp## ing out corrupt## ion and efficient## ly combat## ing organise## d crime . 
I should like at this point to call on the European Commission , with## in the frame## work of the Comm## un## ity policy on border region## s with candid## ate countries , to draft a new stu## dy on the repercussion## s which the integration of Bulgaria and Roman## ia will have on the border region## s of the Member State## s . 
I would remind you in this con## text that the European Commission it## self , in the person of the competent Commission## er , Mr Ver## heugen , found that region## s s## uch as north @## -## @ eastern Greece , which border on two countries , face by far the most difficult situ## ation at European level . 
the poli## cies and action## s of the European Union to promot## e trans @## -## @ national , trans @## -## @ regional and cross @## -## @ border co## operation and to combat the repercussion## s of enlarge## ment on development and employ## ment in border region## s should be continu## ed and reinforce## d . 
similar## ly , special care must be take## n when distribut## ing resource## s and prepar## ing programme## s for territorial co## operation in the new 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 program## ming period . 
Madam President , it is the case that Bulgaria &apos;## s capacity to comp## ly with the Comm## un## ity ha## s increas## ed consider## ably and is continu## ing to do s## o . 
n## ever## the## less , the Committee on Indus## try , Re## search and Energy wish## es to stress that in the sector## s of research and development , energ## y , industrial policy and tele## communic## ations policy an additional ef## fort is require## d if we want the in## corpo## ration of Bulgaria to be an histo## ric success , since the access## ion d## ate is now get## ting ver## y close . 
further## more , in order correct## ly to assess the progress ma## de and there## by propos## e the change## s s## till to be ma## de , we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission , but also of the assess## ments of the different international bodies and other in## dependent research centre## s , who## s## e opinion may be of great assist## ance in ana## ly## s## ing and evalu## ating Bulgaria &apos;## s capacity in these area## s , with a view to it## s in## corpo## ration in## to the European Union . 
in any e## vent , our current view## s with regard to e## ach of the sector## s which are the respons## ibility of our committee are as follow## s : with regard to energ## y policy , Bulgaria - as ha## s al## read## y be## en s## aid - current## ly depend## s on nuclear energ## y to cover it## s internal need## s , but the re## ality is that it## s nuclear power station## s are technical## ly obsolete and the d## ism## ant## ling of some of them ha## s be## en ver## y expensive . 
as ha## s also be## en point## ed out , it is now propos## ed to modernise unit## s 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy power station , and additional fund## s will be require## d for this , since the European Union &apos;## s contribut## ions are clear## ly in## sufficient . 
fund## s from international don## ors are require## d , though we are not see## ing the govern## ment priorit## ise this issue as it should do . 
in the tele## communic## ations sector , the in## depend## ence of the regulator## y author## ity should be guarantee## d , and it should have the power to resolv## e commercial disput## es and guarantee the principle of universal## ity , in accord## ance with Comm## un## ity legisl## ation . 
it is also necess## ary to re## formulate industrial and business policy and improve the administ## rative capacity to facilit## ate the work of small and medium @## -## @ s## ized business## es , which are the tru## e creat## ors of job## s and an extra## ordinary source of techno## logical innov## ation . 
with regard to the research sector , de## spite Bulgaria &apos;## s particip## ation in the Six## th Framework Pro## gramme , it## s pre## s## ence ha## s be## en ver## y limit## ed . 
Madam President , this is essential## ly the content of the amend## ment our committee is present## ing to the report we are deba## ting . 
- Madam President , Minister , Commission## er , congratul## ations to the rapporteur and congratul## ations to Bulgaria as well . 
it ha## s closed all the chap## ter## s and is an ex## ample and an inspir## ation to all it## s neighbour## s . 
I repeat , to all it## s neighbour## s . 
it would be an even better ex## ample if it took just one more step in it## s relation## ship with it## s minor## ities and di## d the same for the other minor## ities liv## ing in Bulgaria as it ha## s al## read## y done for the Turk## ish minor## ity . &apos; the Balkan## s , that an## cient mountain range , &quot; as the Bulgaria## n national ant## hem go## es , and the word &apos; Balkan## s &quot; as a political problem does not app## ly in the case of Bulgaria . 
Bulgaria al## read## y belong## s to Western Europe and it is the Western Balkan## s that we will have to deal with in the futur## e . 
this is why I feel that it is import## ant that when we are talk## ing about Bulgaria , we should also pay some attention to Macedonia , which ha## s al## read## y submit## ted it## s application for member## ship of the European Union and that the European Union it## self should also take an## other step forward . 
the US## A ha## s recognis## ed Macedonia by the name that it cho## s## e for it## self . 
we s## till continu## e to use the name F## Y## ROM and it is high time we took an## other step forward be## cause this would also be a great step to## ward## s the European## isation of this area . 
in an hour and a half &apos;## s time , Commission## er , you will be meet## ing a delegation from Serb## ia and Monte## negro . 
this is the delegation &apos;## s first visit to the European Parliament and I believ## e that the ex## ample of Bulgaria should be us## ed as an inspir## ation for all it## s neighbour## s to do more for the futur## e prospect## s and st## ability of this part of the world . 
there## fore it seem## s to me that we could all learn more from Bulgaria and that Bulgaria &apos;## s principal neighbour could learn a lot . 
I am talk## ing about Tur## key , a country we have support## ed today in say## ing &apos; y## es &quot; to the start of negoti## ations . 
Bulgaria is the last country on the road to Tur## key and I believ## e that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to perform in this respect , should support all of these countries s## o that the## y can particip## ate fully bo## th economic## ally and political## ly and bring about a further enlarge## ment of the European Union . 
-## Madam President , bo## th the re## solution## s and opinion## s of the Commission and the Council giving the go @## -## @ a## head for the integration of Bulgaria and Roman## ia in futur## e year## s clear## ly set out the object## ive## s of European capital , which are al## read## y be## ing realis## ed , to annex these countries , plunder the## ir wealth and the## ir econom## y , exploit the## ir workers to an un## believ## able degree and convert them to NA## TO satellite## s , s## o that the## y can serve it## s aggress## ive policy . 
the re## solution## s record , to a degree , certain aspect## s of the wretch## ed and in## human## e liv## ing conditio## ns of the work## ing class## es in these countries and the poor grass @## -## @ root## s class## es , but these are the result of the resto## ration of capital## ism , which is ero## d## ing all the social right## s achiev## ed and , on the other hand , is concentr## ating wealth in the hand## s of a new pluto## cracy and foreign monopol## ies . 
there are in fact two Bulgaria## s and two Roman## ia## s : on the one hand , the countries of lux## ury for the new pluto## crats in Bulgaria and Roman## ia and the foreign## ers who are literal## ly plunder## ing these countries and , on the other , the countries of two proud nation## s literal## ly be## ing drag## ged in## to mis## ery and humili## ation . 
the con## sequenc## es of the integration process and of the humili## ating term## s accept## ed by the govern## ments of these countries are al## read## y visible . 
you s## poke to us of success## es . 
s## o listen to the success## es : in Bulgaria , the mini## mum wage is EUR 61 and in Roman## ia it is EUR 69 , compar## ed with EUR 1.1## 73 in France and EUR 6## 05 in Greece . 
the rapid increas## e in import## s , in con## junction with plummet## ing export## s , ha## s result## ed in increas## ed de## ficit## s . 
pur## cha## s## ing power in Roman## ia is 60 % of what it was in 19## 89 . 
indus## try ha## s be## en destroy## ed and agri## cultural production is oper## ating be## low par . 
the object## ive of the new direct## ion propos## ed in the re## solution## s and the new measure## s is to creat## e better conditio## ns , an institutional frame## work and infra## structure## s for the most un## account## able action by capital , the complete sell## ing off of public proper## ty and land and the abolition of any social right## s achiev## ed . 
the workers in these countries , together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe , must fight again## st the policy of the European Union and , more import## ant## ly , again## st the new tension## s expect## ed in the area as a result of the serious rival## ry which is begin## ning to manifest it## self . 
Madam President , this debate is , actual## ly , a token of congratul## ation to Bulgaria , al## though it go## es with## out say## ing that it s## till ha## s man## y problem## s , and much remain## s to be deal## t with . 
a great deal , of course , s## till need## s to be done in the field of human right## s and human traffick## ing , but the## y are do## ing the## ir level best , which was not evident be## fore . 
it is for that reason that I believ## e that Bulgaria should be able to join the European Union in 20## 07 . 
the## y belong a## mong us . 
I would also like to see more attention give## n to a debate about Bulgaria &apos;## s access## ion th## an to one about Tur## key &apos;## s . 
after all , Bulgaria is a tru## ly European country , stradd## ling the old and new Europe , and deserve## s all our attention . 
I can foresee some problem## s with regard to it## s access## ion . 
while there are , of course , problem## s in Bulgaria it## self , the big## gest may well be in the European Union . 
the fact is that fund## ing for it## s access## ion is not y## et complete## ly in place . 
after 20## 07 , we will be talk## ing about the financial perspective up to 20## 13 , and I am surprise## d at the discuss## ion that is be## ing held in the Council and else## where , in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1 % of the gross domestic product . 
if you look at all the forecast## s that have be## en ma## de , fund## ing for Bulgaria &apos;## s access## ion is no## where to be found . 
I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission , which was right in say## ing that it need## s more money th## an 1 % . 
if , how## ever , we look at the propos## al## s for agri## culture , for ex## ample , we notice that th## ose do not include a budget for agri## culture in Bulgaria , while the development of the country## side in Bulgaria will play a key role in the development of that country it## self . 
any## one who love## s the country## side , love## s the country it## self and actual## ly does some## thing for the futur## e of that country . 
I am there## fore interest## ed to hear how the Council intend## s to fund this access## ion and how we can ensu## re in a correct and proper mann## er that Bulgaria become## s a tru## ly European country in 20## 07 . 
I should like to finish off with an## other point . 
in the respons## es by the Con## federal Group of the Unit## ed Left / Nord## ic Green Left - which does , after all , com## prise quit## e a few former Communist## s - I was s## truck by the fact that people have some difficult## y with the major political change## s in Bulgaria . 
to th## ose people , I have this to say . 
the Bulgaria## ns have a better grasp of politic## s th## an your group , and do you know why ? 
the## y judge politic## ians by the## ir action## s , which may lead to major shift## s . 
I am pleas## ed to see that the Bulgaria## ns , in term## s of democratic think## ing , are further advance## d th## an man## y Member## s from the G## UE / NGL Group . 
- Madam President , I should like , now that access## ion negoti## ations have be## en conclude## d with Bulgaria , for us to start by high## light## ing and wel## coming the huge ef## fort## s ma## de by the Bulgaria## n people and the political force## s in the country to push a## head with change## s and reform## s and in## corporate the . 
the access## ion of Bulgaria and Roman## ia will close the circl## e of enlarge## ment open## ed with the ten new countries . 
it is a development of strategic import## ance which un## ites the Balkan## s and Europe and will contribut## e to peace , st## ability , co## operation and development in the area as a whole . 
how## ever , I should like to under## line a number of cruc## ial point## s bo## th to the Commission and to the Presidency . 
d## uring the next s## tage , Bulgaria will need to step up it## s ef## fort## s to app## ly the in four sector## s which are of particular import## ance to the European Union and to Greece : 
the first is the sector of environment## al protection , nuclear safety , nuclear waste manage## ment and the qual## ity of river water . 
react## ors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 20## 06 , in accord## ance with the commit## ment give## n by the Bulgaria## n author## ities , and modern## isation of nuclear install## ations with Comm## un## ity financ## ing from the PH## AR## E programme and from the European Bank for Re## construct## ion and Develop## ment must continu## e normal## ly . 
in the sector of labour relation## s and labour law , additional reform## s are need## ed for Bulgaria to approach European standard## s and over## turn social exclus## ion practice## s which affect Comm## un## ity - and e## special## ly Greek - under## taking## s in border region## s , where there is a serious problem with re## location## s . 
further## more , de## ficit## s are record## ed in the three sector## s of combat## ing organise## d crime , traffick## ing in human be## ing## s and control## ling external border## s and combat## ing illegal im## migration . 
final## ly , I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedure## s and great## er trans## par## ency in the sector of public procure## ment and public work## s are need## ed , as is the safeguard## ing of equal treat## ment of all Comm## un## ity under## taking## s , including Greek under## taking## s . 
the European Commission must use the mechan## ism## s provid## ed for , with annual evalu## ation report## s and safeguard## ing clause## s , to monitor close## ly the efficient application of the and safeguard Comm## un## ity interest## s , even after the access## ion of Bulgaria on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
. Madam President , I appreci## ate the posit## ive remark## s from Member## s of Parliament with regard to the access## ion of Bulgaria . 
Mr Po## s## s## elt , Mr Maat , Mr## s Do## bo## ly## i and other## s we## re clear on that issue . 
Member## s s## aid that there are s## till a lot of concern## s . 
that is tru## e . 
that is precise## ly the reason why we have the frame## work , the procedure , with extra monitor## ing and an extra benchmark and , if necess## ary , an extra sanction , an extra safeguard for an extra year be## fore the moment of access## ion . 
with regard to the financial issue ra## ised by Mr Maat and other## s , I do not think we need to be concern## ed . 
the financial con## sequenc## es of access## ion are al## read## y cover## ed in the s## o @## -## @ call## ed financial package for the year## s 20## 07 @## -## @ 09 . 
that is ir## respect## ive of the new financial perspective . 
an import## ant issue that was ra## ised again today is the import## ance of having an individual approach to different countries . 
you know the formal position - one treat## y for Roman## ia and Bulgaria . 
it is import## ant , and necess## ary , to different## iate . 
that is precise## ly what we want to do in the word## ing of the conclusion## s next Thursday or Fri## day in the Council , concentr## ating on the different chap## ter## s . 
if necess## ary we can different## iate at the moment of actual access## ion , be## cause there is the possibil## ity of post## pon## ing access## ion for a maxim## um of one year . 
I thank the rapporteur , Mr Van Or## den , for hi## s adequate and balance## d report . 
I re## ally welcome it## s conclusion## s . 
. Madam President , I promise to s## peak slow## ly and un## hurried## ly . 
I wish to say thank you for the pertinent debate and th## ose point## s of view express## ed which , in the main , support the Commission &apos;## s re## commend## ations . 
I will respond to just a coup## le of the most central issue## s . 
I will s## peak first about the coup## ling of Roman## ia and Bulgaria . 
it is tru## e that a joint Access## ion Treat## y is be## ing draft## ed for these countries . on the other hand , as Mr Nicolaï ver## y clear## ly explain## ed , e## ach is be## ing treat## ed accord## ing to a different## iated approach , e## special## ly now the process is in it## s last stag## es and the monitor## ing system and safeguard clause are ways of ens## uring that e## ach country is assess## ed accord## ing to the ex## tent to which the## y are able to implement the reform## s and commit## ments that need to be fulfill## ed be## fore these countries can accede to the Union . 
I would also like to emphasis## e that Bulgaria is not y## et read## y for member## ship either : much work is be## ing ask## ed of it , but , at the same time , Bulgaria ha## s all the potent## ial to ful## fil it## s commit## ments to en## able it to accede to the Union on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
I will s## peak next about corrupt## ion , which ha## s attract## ed much attention in speech## es . 
that is quit## e right and I agree with th## ose view## s express## ed . 
Bulgaria ha## s re## cent## ly drawn up a determine## d strate## gy to act again## st corrupt## ion . 
it is particular## ly concern## ed with im## prov## ing border control## s , develop## ing the work of the traffic police and the institution## s in general , and counter## ing corrupt## ion in Bulgaria &apos;## s administ## ration . 
this is in fact the main focus of Sub @## -## @ Pro## gramme 4 under the PH## AR## E programme and it will also become much more obvi## ously the main focus over the coming two year## s , in 20## 05 and 20## 06 . 
t## hirdly and final## ly , I wish to talk about the status of minor## ities , and e## special## ly that of the Roma . 
in Bulgaria , new legisl## ation again## st discrimin## ation ha## s re## cent## ly be## en pass## ed and ha## s enter## ed in## to force there . 
it took effect in Janu## ary of this year and it is present## ly be## ing implement## ed in con## junction with an anti @## -## @ discrimin## atory action programme to improve the status of minor## ities . 
we are ver## y close## ly monitor## ing this new legisl## ation and the implement## ation of the action programme to support it . 
I am also pleas## ed that other European organisation## s , s## uch as the Council of Europe , in the build## ing next to our## s , is giving attention to this issue and work## ing to strength## en the status of the Roma . 
we would all certain## ly have be## en present at the open## ing ceremony of the Council of Europe &apos;## s Roma For## um at 12 n## oon today , but at the same time we we## re deba## ting , and you we## re vot## ing on , the ver## y import## ant report on Tur## key , s## o , un## fortunate## ly , we could not get there . 
I wish to thank the European Parliament for it## s support and counsel , and I congratul## ate the rapporteur , Mr Van Or## den , and Bulgaria , which hope## fully will become an ex## ample to the entire Balkan region . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place tomor## row at 11.## 30 a.m . 
the next item is the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 61 / 20## 04 ) by Mr Mos## co## vici , on be## half of the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s , on Roman## ia &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion &#91; 20## 04 / 21## 84 ( IN## I ) &#93; . 
I should like to invit## e Mr Mos## co## vici to take the floor , and to inform him that he may s## peak for f## ive minute## s . 
- Mr President , the political con## text in which I am tabling this report ha## s become clear## er in re## cent week## s . 
last week the Commission was able to close access## ion negoti## ations with Roman## ia on the last two chap## ter## s , name## ly justice and home affair## s , and competit## ion . 
more## over , legisl## ative elect## ions and th## en p## resident## ial elect## ions have also be## en held in re## cent week## s , put## ting a different political party in power under conditio## ns that have be## en recognis## ed by all of the part## ies . 
this inform## ation obvi## ously does not change the philosoph## y and general thrust of the report . 
I want## ed to draft and submit a balance## d report to the House , that is to say a report that was bo## th rigor## ous and clear , be## cause Roman## ia &apos;## s situ## ation pose## s man## y problem## s . y## et I also want## ed it to be a friend## ly report , be## cause we all want Roman## ia and Bulgaria to join and be## cause this country ha## s work## ed hard to prepar## e for access## ion . 
on this bas## is , we are propos## ing that we bo## th take note of Roman## ia &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion and also remain aware of it## s limit## s and short## coming## s , and the ex## tent of the work that remain## s to be done . 
these two aspect## s , the limit## s and the progress , are actual## ly set out for e## ach of the area## s in question . 
the## y are present## ed first with regard to the political crite## ria , and it is there with## out any doubt that the main difficult## ies lie . 
there are limit## s to the progress ma## de ; for ex## ample , the reform of the civil service does not go far en## ough , the use of emerge## ncy ordinance## s is not desir## able and quit## e excess## ive , and as for legisl## ative procedure## s , every## one know## s that the## y are not perfect . 
but over and above this limit## ed progress , a number of problem## s , serious problem## s , remain as far as free## dom## s are concern## ed . 
I am think## ing first## ly of the free## dom of inform## ation and express## ion , which is deni## ed to a great man## y journal## ists . 
I am think## ing of the judicial system , which de## spite initial improve## ments is un## question## ably in need of further attention . 
I am think## ing , of course , of corrupt## ion , which is s## till end## emic in Roman## ia , even at high level## s . 
on all of these problem## s - free## dom of express## ion , corrupt## ion , the judicial and police system## s - I believ## e that the European Parliament ha## s a du## ty to be absolut## e## ly un## compromis## ing . 
at the same time , we can## not ignor## e the fact that progress ha## s un## doubt## ed## ly be## en ma## de . 
the Commission ha## s recognis## ed that Roman## ia satisf## ies the C## open## hagen political crite## ria ; the country ha## s embark## ed on public administ## ration reform , and constitutional reform is also under## way . 
the judicial system , as I have s## aid , is start## ing to improve and we are also see## ing progress on child protection - re## quest## ed by our own Parliament , incident## ally - even though it is possible to go further . 
over## all th## en , I believ## e that Roman## ia ha## s listen## ed to the re## commend## ations ma## de by the Commission and Parliament , in particular th## ose that we## re ma## de at the instig## ation of the pre## vi## ous rapporteur , Mr## s N## icholson . 
we find the same problem with the economic crite## ria : there are limit## s to the progress ma## de , macro## economic st## ability is not y## et guarantee## d and p## over## ty remain## s at quit## e excess## ive level## s . 
at the same time , we have seen progress in the fight again## st social exclus## ion , in the fight again## st p## over## ty and in the adopt## ion of legisl## ation on social protection . 
the thir## d and final area is every## thing to do with the . 
as I s## aid at the out## set , negoti## ations on this are complete . more## over , I do not believ## e that it would be wise to reopen them , al## though I have read that the new## ly @## -## @ elect## ed p## resident intend## s to do s## o . 
for my part , I think that the treat## y should first be ratifi## ed and sign## ed be## fore it is re## negotiate## d . 
we need , how## ever , to implement the legisl## ation that ha## s be## en adopt## ed , in particular that re## l## ating to the free move## ment of good## s and capital , financial control , the environment , industrial production , regional policy and issue## s of justice and home affair## s . 
this assess## ment , which I hope is balance## d , is the bas## is for the conclusion## s that I am re## commend## ing , and the## y are as follow## s : as thing## s stand there is nothing to prevent a joint access## ion treat## y - I repeat , a joint treat## y - be## ing sign## ed for Roman## ia and Bulgaria at the begin## ning of 20## 05 for access## ion in 20## 07 . 
clear## ly this is a political decision , but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close watch on development## s through all of the follow @## -## @ up action## s and other report## s that we can table here . 
a final word on the amend## ments table## d : we di## d a good job , in my opinion , in the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s , which en## able## d the report to be adopt## ed by a ver## y large major## ity . 
the remain## ing amend## ments to the report fall in## to two categor## ies . 
there are th## ose that improve the sub## stance of the report , in particular on social protection , human right## s , the dis## able## d , the protection of child## ren and young people , and re## commend## ations on industrial policy , and I am obvi## ously in favour of these . 
th## en there are other amend## ments that call in## to question the exist## ence of a joint access## ion treat## y or which change the nature and balance of the report , which clear## ly I do not support . 
this morning we ma## de the histo## ric decision to open negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
I believ## e that con## clud## ing them with Roman## ia and Bulgaria , and with Roman## ia in particular , is , in contrast , a logical decision , and people would not understand if we di## d not do bo## th of these thing## s together . 
. Mr President , it is a great pleas## ure for me to be able to inform you here formal## ly that on 14 Dec## ember 20## 04 the General Affair## s Council also closed the negoti## ations with Roman## ia . 
as I s## aid when refer## ring to Bulgaria , it is a new step to## ward## s a re## ally reunite## d Europe bas## ed on mutual## ly accept## ed principle## s of demo## cracy and the rule of law . 
I will elaborate brief## ly on the process of closing the last cha## lleng## ing chap## ter## s with Roman## ia and focus on the monitor## ing system develop## ed to ensu## re a proper start for Roman## ia with## in the European Union . 
the two remain## ing chap## ter## s , which have be## en regard## ed as the most difficult one## s - competit## ion policy , and justice and home affair## s - we## re technical## ly closed by the General Affair## s Council on 14 Dec## ember 20## 04 . 
I believ## e we have be## en able to find appropriate solution## s for all the issue## s ra## ised in th## ose final week## s through close and construct## ive co## operation between the Commission and the Council . 
how## ever , closing these two chap## ter## s mean## s that the real work continu## es for the Roman## ians . 
over the next two year## s Roman## ia will have to make real and sustain## ed ef## fort## s in order to be tru## ly read## y for member## ship . 
good intention## s are not en## ough : these must be match## ed by progress on the ground , in particular in the implement## ation of commit## ments . 
the EU will of course continu## e to support the prepar## ations at all level## s : the Commission will enhance the monitor## ing of progress commit## ments under## take## n in all area## s of the . 
we learn## ed from represent## ative## s of bo## th govern## ments that monitor## ing system## s help## ed them ver## y much in continu## ing , and even intens## ifying , the reform## s need## ed . 
on competit## ion policy , this chap## ter is at the core of the internal market and European economic integration . 
the proper enforce## ment of EU competit## ion rule## s is a precondition for creat## ing a reli## able business environment and require## s appropriate administ## rative capacity . 
this is a long @## -## @ term process . 
it is for th## ose reason## s that competit## ion disciplin## e is also a key aspect of the Europe agree## ment . 
other key aspect## s are legisl## ative align## ment and the institutional and administ## rative structure## s in Roman## ia . 
what need## s to be done to bring all legisl## ation , including second## ary legisl## ation , in## to line with the require## ments in the area## s of anti## trust and State aid , in particular in relation to fiscal aid ? 
the Roman## ian Com## petition Council should be give## n the power## s , resource## s and the well @## -## @ train## ed staff it need## s to ful## fil it## s role . 
this Council should prohibit any measure## s which would be in contradict## ion with the State aid and the Europe agree## ment . 
let me turn to the steel sector , which is a sensitiv## e sector a## cross the EU . 
Roman## ia ha## s ask## ed for a prolong## ation of the s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; grace period &apos; under the Europe agree## ment for re## structuring the steel indus## try . 
again , we on## ly agree## d to this now it is clear that Roman## ia will abide by all the commit## ments and all the conditio## ns set out in the EU &apos;## s position . 
these commit## ments include draw## ing up a national re## structuring programme as well as an individual business plan , capacity reduction and d## ism## ant## ling of the install## ations . 
the European Union expect## s Roman## ia to respect all it## s commit## ments and take all the necess## ary measure## s with## in the dead## line## s laid down in the EU &apos;## s position . 
in this con## text , I should recall the safeguard## s we have at our dispos## al . 
in October 20## 05 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assess## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s progress in the area of competit## ion policy . 
any serious short## coming## s observ## ed in this report regard## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s oblig## ations under the Europe agree## ment and / or the ful## fil## ment of the commit## ments can form the bas## is for a re## commend## ation by the Commission to invoke safeguard## s , in particular the one post## pon## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion by one year . 
here the Council can decide by a qualified major## ity . 
on this understand## ing , I have come to the conclusion that this chap## ter does not require further negoti## ations . 
let me say that it is now in Roman## ia &apos;## s hand## s to ensu## re that it meet## s all it## s commit## ments in this chap## ter , allow## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s smooth integration in## to the European Union . 
turn## ing to justice and home affair## s , this is a chap## ter which is bo## th extens## ive and complex . 
it is at the heart of our object## ive of maintain## ing and develop## ing the European Union as an area of free## dom , securit## y and justice . 
it ha## s a direct bear## ing on the live## s of every EU citizen , and is there## fore a key part of the which must be respect## ed . 
negoti## ations on this chap## ter have be## en long and detail## ed . 
Roman## ia ha## s ma## de a consider## able number of firm commit## ments on all area## s of the justice and home affair## s . 
there are sever## al area## s to which particular attention should be paid , s## uch as implement## ation of the Sch## en## gen action plan ; ens## uring a high level of control and sur## veil## lance at the external border## s of the Union ; implement## ing the reform of the judic## iary ; step## ping up the fight again## st corrupt## ion to ensu## re that corrupt## ion case## s are deal## t with in a swift and trans## parent mann## er ; making consider## able progress in fill## ing the large number of vac## ancies in the police force## s ; as well as develop## ing and implement## ing a coherent multi## annual anti @## -## @ crime strate## gy . 
these issue## s have also be## en address## ed in Mr Mos## co## vici &apos;## s report on Roman## ia . 
the Union will close## ly monitor Roman## ia &apos;## s implement## ation of all it## s commit## ments relate## d to justice and home affair## s , right up to the moment of access## ion in order to meet EU standard## s . 
this include## s adh## er## ing to the planned legisl## ative schedul## e and taking further measure## s to develop the institutional and administ## rative capacity of all Roman## ian law enforce## ment author## ities and of the judic## iary . 
we believ## e that this should be possible if the necess## ary political ef## fort , as well as the require## d financial and human resource## s , are deploy## ed to this end . 
if , how## ever , any serious short## coming## s are observ## ed in the ful## fil## ment by Roman## ia of it## s commit## ments and in particular any of the specific commit## ments list## ed in the EU position , this can form the bas## is for in## vo## king the safeguard clause post## pon## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion by one year . 
here again , the Council can decide by qualified major## ity . 
the European Union will continu## e to monitor close## ly Roman## ia &apos;## s prepar## ations and achiev## e## ments , including the effective implement## ation of the commit## ments under## take## n in all area## s of the and in particular the area## s of justice and home affair## s , competit## ion and the environment . 
to this end , the Commission will continu## e to submit annual report## s on Roman## ia &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion , together with re## commend## ations if appropriate . 
I welcome the statement in the report by Mr Mos## co## vici that the European Parliament will monitor the development## s in Roman## ia as well and encourag## e the new Roman## ian Govern## ment to ful## fil all the commit## ments ma## de d## uring the negoti## ations . 
it is quit## e clear that the report adopt## ed by the European Parliament in Mar## ch 20## 04 ha## s fulfill## ed it## s purpose as a wake @## -## @ up call to the Roman## ian Govern## ment . 
that is how the Roman## ian Govern## ment ha## s perceiv## ed it ; and it ha## s convince## d it to intens## ify the access## ion strate## gy and poli## cies . 
I was de## light## ed to learn that Parliament , in it## s la## test report about Roman## ia , could subscrib## e to the re## commend## ations of the regular report of the Commission . 
since th## en - and I para## phrase the word## ing of the Commission - we all have ma## de every ef## fort to meet the European Council object## ive## s to bring the negoti## ations with Bulgaria and Roman## ia to a success## ful conclusion in 20## 04 , on the bas## is of it## s own merit## s , with a view to sign## ing the Access## ion Treat## y as ear## ly as possible in 20## 05 , and we all expect Bulgaria and Roman## ia to ful## fil the economic and crite## ria and to be read## y for member## ship on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like first of all to thank Mr Mos## co## vici for tabling a report that is bo## th balance## d and in @## -## @ depth . 
the Commission ha## s al## ways warm## ly welcome## d the European Parliament &apos;## s construct## ive engage## ment in the process of Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union . 
I should also like to thank the Council for it## s productive co## operation . 
Mr President , your report of Mar## ch 20## 04 was a real &apos; wake @## -## @ up call &apos; for Roman## ia . 
be## ing tough and ver## y demand## ing , it final## ly help## ed to bring about further progress in the access## ion negoti## ations . 
it led , with the Commission &apos;## s im## petus , to a s## eries of reform## s , which we## re list## ed in Roman## ia &apos;## s famous &apos; To Do List &apos; , under which the Roman## ian author## ities put great## er emphasis on im## prov## ing political and economic govern## ance . 
as Mr Nicolaï s## aid , the Union will now final## ise the access## ion negoti## ations with Roman## ia on Fri## day . 
how## ever , I under## line that con## clud## ing the negoti## ations does not mean the end of the work . 
on the contr## ary , the two @## -## @ year period to 20## 07 must be us## ed by Roman## ia to become a full @## -## @ fledg## ed Member State : plen## ty of hard work , commit## ment and e## special## ly deliver## y is need## ed . 
we will carry out an enhance## d monitor## ing of compliance with the commit## ments enter## ed in## to and of on## going prepar## ations in general . 
for Roman## ia and Bulgaria , we have agree## d a new safeguard clause cover## ing the period between closure of the negoti## ations and actual access## ion . 
this clause provid## es for the postpone## ment of access## ion by one year if there is clear evidence that Roman## ia will be manifest## ly un## prepar## ed to meet the require## ments of member## ship . 
the Member State## s could th## en activate the suspens## ion clause by un## anim## ity , on the bas## is of the Commission &apos;## s re## commend## ation . 
let me also point out that in the chap## ter concern## ing competit## ion and state aid## s , the Commission was not able to propos## e a provision## al closure of negoti## ations . 
how## ever , the Council , due to ear## lier political commit## ments , cho## s## e to close the negoti## ations by the end of 20## 04 . 
more## over , in regard to justice and home affair## s , the Council ask## ed for more re## assuring enforce## ment mechan## ism## s . 
there## fore , in close co## operation with the N## ether## land## s preside## ncy , the Commission work## ed out a propos## al for a reinforce## d monitor## ing mechan## ism link## ed to safeguard clause## s in these two area## s : justice and home affair## s , and competit## ion and state aid## s . 
in these area## s , the suspens## ion clause can be activate## d by a qualified major## ity of the Member State## s , which give## s it strong## er cred## ibility th## an if it we## re on## ly activate## d by un## anim## ity . 
I would like to emphasis## e here that I fully endorse the provision## s of this clause . 
should the monitor## ing by the Commission show that Roman## ia is not proper## ly prepar## ed for member## ship , we should not hesit## ate to re## commend that the Council invoke this suspens## ion clause . 
to be absolut## e## ly clear : the aim of this clause is not to penal## ise Roman## ia , but to protect Roman## ia and the EU Member State## s from any negat## ive effect## s that Roman## ia &apos;## s possible manifest un## prepar## ed## ness for member## ship might entail . 
be## fore closing , let me brief## ly touch upon the political situ## ation in Roman## ia . 
I know that Parliament is concern## ed about alleg## ed irregular## ities in the parliament## ary and p## resident## ial elect## ions that re## cent## ly took place in Roman## ia . 
I am also aware of the assess## ments ma## de by sever## al Roman## ian N## GO## s . 
how## ever , I would like to recall that the OS## CE elect## ion assess## ment team stated that over## all the administ## ration of the Roman## ian elect## ions &apos; seem## ed professional and efficient## ly organise## d &apos; . 
I also note that the OS## CE ha## s assess## ed the over## all conduct of the elect## ion as satisfactory in the second round . 
more## over , bo## th p## resident## ial candid## ate## s accept## ed the final result## s of the p## resident## ial elect## ions . 
I trust - and this is import## ant for the European Union as well as for Roman## ia - that the new p## resident @## -## @ elect and the forth## coming govern## ment in formation will be determine## d to continu## e with the reform## s that are need## ed for Roman## ia to accede to the European Union . 
that is ver## y much in the interest of Roman## ia and Roman## ians . 
let me conclude by say## ing that I endorse the conclusion## s of the report by your rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici , which are , in general , in line with the 20## 04 Regul## ar Report . 
the Commission will continu## e to keep Parliament inform## ed of Roman## ia &apos;## s progress to## ward## s access## ion . 
. 
Mr President , the Committee on Budget## s would like to point out that the financial pre @## -## @ access## ion aid grant## ed to Roman## ia in 20## 04 ha## s amount## ed to EUR 82## 5 million , which come## s from the national PH## AR## E programme and the SAP## A## RD and ISP## A instrument## s . 
I would also like to point out that the total volume of this aid is approximate## ly equi## valent to 1.4 % of the country &apos;## s G## DP . 
as in the case of Bulgaria , the Committee on Budget## s is pleas## ed about the establish## ment in spring 20## 04 of the new fund## ing frame## work for the access## ion of Roman## ia . 
it is also pleas## ed that , as for Bulgaria , the Commission ha## s propos## ed restrict## ing this package of aid to a period of three year## s in order that it may be adapt## ed to the futur## e political need## s stemm## ing from the new financial perspective## s that are going to be approve## d . 
all of the financial aid will depend on these new financial perspective## s , but from 20## 09 . 
un## like what happen## ed in the case of the report on Bulgaria , in this case the Committee on Budget## s wish## es to stress the need to make sustain## ed ef## fort## s to enhance Roman## ia &apos;## s administ## rative capacity with regard to the essential field## s of custom## s , V## AT and statistic## s on gross domestic product . 
this mean## s having appropriate capacity to collect and control V## AT and custom## s du## ties , and to calculate gross domestic product cred## ibly , precise## ly and exhaust## ive## ly , in accord## ance with the S## EC 95 rule## s . 
. 
Mr President , I would first## ly like to congratul## ate the rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici , on the excel## lent work he ha## s done on this report on Roman## ia . 
I would also like to thank him for hi## s open att## itude and hi## s spirit of compromis## e . 
Mr President , in the last two year## s , Roman## ia ha## s ma## de ver## y significant progress on it## s journey to## ward## s integration with the European Union . 
I natural## ly welcome this progress . 
a decisive step ha## s be## en the conclusion of the negoti## ations at the access## ion conference held yesterday . 
the closure of these negoti## ations is expect## ed to be confirm## ed at the European Council this week , but it is clear that the work is not over . 
in fact , Roman## ia ha## s import## ant work to do be## fore the access## ion schedul## ed for 20## 07 can take place . 
I am not on## ly talk## ing about the procedure## s necess## ary for full rat## ification of the Treat## y ; it must also intens## ify it## s ef## fort## s in a s## eries of essential area## s . 
to this end , it must carry out the reform## s in the field of public administ## ration , it must improve judicial administ## ration and ensu## re that it is in## dependent - a field in which it adopt## ed an import## ant legisl## ative package a few month## s ago ; it must enhance the fight again## st corrupt## ion , a serious problem which continu## es to affect the country . 
and ef## fort## s are also need## ed in the field of pre## serv## ing the environment . 
in short , the report which will be present## ed to plen## ary tomor## row spec## ifies in detail man## y area## s in which the Roman## ian author## ities must continu## e to make ef## fort## s . 
Mr President , my position and the report essential## ly consist## s of the follow## ing : on the one hand , an open and posit## ive view of Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union with## in the schedul## ed time## scale . 
on the other hand , a demand## ing position in relation to the ef## fort## s Roman## ia must make , which will require de## termination and per## sever## ance . 
I believ## e that this is the clear twin mess## age that the Roman## ian author## ities now in office follow## ing the elect## ions of re## cent days must receiv## e . 
through this report , the European Parliament is say## ing y## es to the integration of Roman## ia , but it will be monitor## ing that country &apos;## s compliance with all of it## s commit## ments . 
this Parliament must follow the ef## fort## s the Roman## ian author## ities must make ver## y close## ly . 
we are also count## ing on the inform## ation that the Commission must s## end out regular## ly to us in this regard , as the Commission## er ha## s point## ed out . 
final## ly , on this journey Roman## ia s## till ha## s to make to## ward## s access## ion , it can count on our vigil## ance , but , of course , it can also count on our assist## ance and our im## petus . 
. 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I too should like first of all to congratul## ate the rapporteur on a ver## y good and well balance## d report . 
the report mention## s bo## th the posit## ive and the negat## ive aspect## s , the strong point## s and the weak point## s , which Roman## ia will have to address . 
on the posit## ive side , the report clear## ly states that Roman## ia meet## s the C## open## hagen political crite## ria , that it ha## s strength## ened the st## ability of it## s institution## s that guarantee State demo## cracy and human right## s , and that the situ## ation ha## s improve## d in the field of protection of human and ethnic right## s , with regard to bo## th the Hung## arian minor## ity and the Roma minor## ity . 
on the posit## ive side , Roman## ia also ful## fil## s the crite## r## ion of a function## ing market econom## y and , more## over , ha## s implement## ed and is continu## ing to implement a programme of structural reform## s . 
if we look at the economic result## s , the economic statistic## s for Roman## ia , we can see that the country ha## s one of the strong## est grow## th rates in the whole of East## ern Europe . 
natural## ly , Roman## ia s## till ha## s to make consider## able ef## fort## s and make significant progress , how## ever , be## fore it can be accept## ed in## to the European Union . 
bo## th Mr Nicolaï and Mr Re## hn have refer## red to certain aspect## s in detail . 
I should like to mention a few of them : the area## s of justice and internal affair## s , like every## where in East## ern Europe , the fight again## st corrupt## ion and again## st organise## d crime , and also border control## s . 
problem## s also remain in the field## s of economic competit## ion , of state support and , of course , of protect## ing the natural environment . 
in spite of every## thing , how## ever , I believ## e that Roman## ia is well on the way . 
it is up to Roman## ia and Roman## ia al## one as to whet## her it will manage to eliminate all the weak point## s in the coming month## s . 
if it does succeed , I am of the opinion that the treat## y should be sign## ed in 20## 05 s## o that Roman## ia , a## long with Bulgaria , can be accept## ed in## to the European Union in 20## 07 . 
. Mr President , it ha## s be## en a pleas## ure to work with Mr Mos## co## vici on this fine report . 
in## de## ed I enjoy## ed and valu## ed hi## s work in hi## s ear## lier capacity as a minister . it is just as much of a pleas## ure to work with him as a rapporteur . 
I thank Mr Mos## co## vici for this fine work . 
I believ## e that President Iliescu - as he retire## s from hi## s second and final term of office - and hi## s govern## ment , as well as Pr## ime Minister Nastase , have conclude## d the## ir work on a high note . 
the## y should be proud of the## ir success## ful achiev## e## ment of the enlarge## ment process for Roman## ia . 
it is e## asy today to damn Roman## ia with faint praise , to say that s## he ha## s done well but ha## s a huge amount more to do . 
that may in## de## ed be tru## e , but let us recall the low position from which s## he ha## s come and ha## s advance## d s## o rapid## ly . 
non## e of us would have dream## ed f## ive year## s ago , when the Hel## s## ink## i Council declare## d Roman## ia to be one of the &apos; re## g## at## ta principle &apos; countries , that s## he could have complete## d the chap## ter## s s## o rapid## ly and in## de## ed s## o well . 
all the chap## ter## s are closed . 
of course , implement## ation must be high on the age## nda of the new govern## ment and it will have to have ver## y competent people to implement this matter . 
the## y have to app## ly the proper## ly and respect the dead## line## s . 
a great deal of capacity @## -## @ build## ing ha## s to happen . 
administ## rative capacity is vital in app## ly## ing the as well as on## going train## ing of staff . 
how## ever , let us re## member what an enormous amount ha## s be## en achiev## ed . 
one of the ways in which we could help is by try## ing to stop the brain drain . 
Roman## ia need## s it## s young people ver## y bad## ly . 
we should do all we can to strength## en the position of high## er educ## ation in Roman## ia , to help the country offer job## s , train## ing and work## shop## s to young people . 
it would be ver## y e## asy , as Roman## ia come## s ever close## r to the Union , for us to be a magnet for her young people to leave the country . 
that would be a ver## y great p## ity . 
it is th## ose young people who will assist Roman## ia in implement## ing the correct## ly and im## prov## ing the absorpt## ion capacity for the fund## ing that the Commission is put## ting in . 
I congratul## ate the Commission too for the ver## y dedicate## d work which colleague## s and I have seen car## ried out over the last few year## s . 
I have put forward one amend## ment , at which I would ask Mr Mos## co## vici and other colleague## s to look care## fully . 
the## y have acknowledg## ed that I have be## en concentr## ating in particular on the issue of child## ren . 
while I under## stood and respect## ed Mr Mos## co## vici &apos;## s support for Pr## ime Minister Raffarin &apos;## s re## quest for an international commission to re @## -## @ examin## e certain sensitiv## e case## s on human## itarian ground## s where there have be## en problem## s with inter @## -## @ country adopt## ion , non## e## the## less , I wonder if colleague## s might consider accept## ing my amend## ment to paragraph 17 . 
Mr Mos## co## vici &apos;## s report re## quest## s an international commission . 
that is one out## side the European Union . 
my own amend## ment ask## s the Commission to take up this matter with the Roman## ian Govern## ment - which is right and proper - and also to report back to the govern## ment of Roman## ia and - since I know that colleague## s are concern## ed about this - to the European Parliament as well . 
per## hap## s Mr Mos## co## vici and I could discuss this . 
I am s## ure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treat## y . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , let it be clear that this is not a debate between th## ose in favour of Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion to the European Union and th## ose who oppose it . 
my group does not have any fundamental object## ions to Roman## ia &apos;## s member## ship either , not even on 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
this is a debate , how## ever , between th## ose who think that , except for a few loose end## s , Roman## ia is read## y , and th## ose , my## self include## d , who think that it is not , and see that as a reason why we can## not give the go @## -## @ a## head right now . 
I am , in all honest## y , surprise## d at the position of some group## s . 
the ver## y same Member## s of this House who right## ly attach## ed great import## ance to human right## s d## uring the vot## e and discuss## ions about Tur## key , a country that is on the ver## y thresh## old of negoti## ations , are , in the case of Roman## ia , a country that is comp## let## ing them , prepar## ed to over## look just about any## thing where the same C## open## hagen crite## ria are concern## ed . 
there are y## et other Member## s in this House who## s## e view of re## ality ha## s , quit## e honest## ly , be## en some## what cloud## ed by the fact that member## s of the## ir part## ies are prob## ably involve## d in re## prehens## ible affair## s , or be## cause the## y hope that , after the re## cent elect## ions in Roman## ia , every## thing will be ver## y different over## night . 
hope for improve## ment is fine , but we should not be naive . 
the problem## s in Roman## ia are immens## e , s## o much s## o that there is no doubt in my mind that we can## not give them the green light . 
I will give you two ex## ample## s . 
over the past few year## s , there ha## s be## en no improve## ment in the situ## ation of journal## ists and the media in Roman## ia ; in## de## ed , it ha## s change## d for the wor## s## e . 
the number of attack## s on critical journal## ists ha## s increas## ed and the critic## ism level## led at them was often connect## ed to case## s of corrupt## ion . 
all N## GO## s , all the organisation## s that we al## ways praise s## o high## ly - Trans## par## ency Inter## national , the Open Soci## ety Institut## e , the OECD - all have one mess## age : corrupt## ion is s## till rife in Roman## ia and should not be under## estimate## d . 
of course , every## one here will state that corrupt## ion is to be combat## ed , but how serious## ly can we take a party which ha## s a major## ity in the Roman## ian parliament and a member of which - also a former minister - had to step down a few year## s ago on account of corrupt## ion , and is now vice @## -## @ chair## man of that same party and a candid## ate for the s## en## ate ? 
in my view , this , together with Amnesty Inter## national &apos;## s report## s about the tru## ly abomin## able treat## ment of psychia## tric patient## s , can on## ly lead to one conclusion , name## ly that Roman## ia should wait for a li## ttle long## er . 
that is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separat## e report next spring , for ex## ample , on the aspect## s which every## one , including the rapporteur , worry about , name## ly free## dom of the press , corrupt## ion , in## depend## ence of the judic## iary ? 
the Commission does compile a report on possible problem## s concern## ing competit## ion , but re## fuse## s to devote a fresh report to human right## s problem## s . 
why should state support be a s## tumbl## ing block and human right## s not ? 
to th## ose who say - and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the preside## ncy - that we s## till have the suspens## ion clause at our dispos## al , which en## able## s us to delay Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion by one year , I should like to state clear## ly that this suspens## ion clause can on## ly be invoke## d if there is a un## anim## ous vot## e in favour of it . 
in other word## s , if one country in the Council re## fuse## s to co## operate , th## en it will not happen . 
what about qualified major## ity ? 
regret## tably , that can on## ly be appli## ed to a number of specific area## s , and free## dom of the press is not one of them . 
in my view , Parliament should not relinquish it## s power by giving the go @## -## @ a## head now and , logical## ly , do## ing the same thing in Mar## ch . 
Parliament must take it## self serious## ly . 
I would like to quote from a major Dutch news## paper : &apos; with friend## liness that lack## s honest## y , Europe may become big , but it is grow## th with## out sub## stance , great## ness with## out inner strength . &quot; 
the strength of the European Union is to be found in principle## s that app## ly universal## ly , including to political al## lies . 
. Mr President , Roman## ia ha## s a long tradition of author## itarian and un## democratic govern## ment , Left @## -## @ wing and Right @## -## @ wing alternate## ly . 
this tradition go## es hand in hand with an in## toler## ant att## itude to## ward## s it## s ethnic minor## ities - Hung## arian## s , Roma and Germa## ns . 
a great deal of attention is al## ways paid to major dam project## s , enormous factor## ies and monument## al build## ing## s , but not to va## grant child## ren menac## ed by glue sniff## ing or prost## itut## ion , or to serious environment## al poll## ution . 
in Ro## s## ia Mont## ana , there is s## till the risk of a gold extract## ion project going a## head , which will use chemical sub## stance## s cap## able of serious## ly poll## ut## ing the s## oil and river water in the long term . 
in the c## ities , the monument## al facade## s hide decay , neglect and p## over## ty . 
free## dom of the press and in## depend## ence of the judic## iary do not meet European standard## s . 
in neighbour## ing Moldavia , which came under Russia## n rule in 19## 40 , there was initial support for re## un## ification , but , as Roman## ia ha## s li## ttle to offer at the moment , that support ha## s now ebb## ed away . 
at present , man## y Roman## ians look up to America and the dollar above all , and , to a less## er ex## tent , to Tur## key , which is regard## ed as a major economic partner and an ex## ample of a self @## -## @ assure## d country . 
at international level , Roman## ia is current## ly , like Tur## key , a close ally of the Unit## ed State## s , s## o much s## o that it is hinder## ing co## operation with the Inter## national Criminal Court in The Ha## gue . 
complain## ts about elect## ion fraud we## re lodg## ed again re## cent## ly . 
I do not expect the care## less interpret## ation of parliament## ary demo## cracy to dis## appear follow## ing last week## end &apos;## s elect## ion of a p## resident from the other side of the political spec## trum , who is also like## ly to determine the com## position of a new govern## ment . 
this new govern## ment will prob## ably take the view that the pre## vi## ous govern## ment was too meek in it## s negoti## ations with the European Union and that it had allow## ed it## self to be humili## ated . 
in it## s pre## vi## ous com## position , this parliament was extreme## ly critical about the possibil## ity of Roman## ia fulfill## ing in the short term the current EU crite## ria in term## s of demo## cracy , human right## s and the environment . 
that is why it seem## ed certain that Roman## ia would be join## ing later th## an Bulgaria , together with Croatia at the ver## y ear## liest . 
I am surprise## d at the re## cent U @## -## @ turn with## in the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s and the re## jection of a number of critical amend## ments . 
the fear that Roman## ia might be humili## ated and the EU &apos;## s ambit## ion for speed## y territorial expansion now appear more imperative th## an solv## ing problem## s . 
the Con## federal Group of the European Unit## ed Left / Nord## ic Green Left would like to welcome Roman## ia to the European Union as quick## ly as possible , provid## ed that , as is the case with Tur## key , solution## s have be## en found to the problem## s in the area## s of demo## cracy , human right## s and the environment , and this is s## till a huge obstacle at the moment . 
. Mr President , as a former ship &apos;## s cap## tain , the new## ly @## -## @ elect## ed President of Roman## ia , T## ra## ian Bas## es## c## u , know## s a thing or two about chop## py water## s , which give## s him a consider## able edge , for the ship of state of hi## s native country , where he will be taking the helm , is current## ly fac## ing rough sea## s . 
more## over , Bas## es## c## u will be the first to admit this frank## ly . in an interview with the of 26 N## ov## ember , Bas## es## c## u , who is at present the may## or of Buch## a## rest , ga## ve this ex## plan## ation of why he is striv## ing to turn hi## s country round political## ly : &apos; the problem is corrupt## ion which , in this country , ha## s be## en elev## ated to a form of govern## ment . &quot; 
the report by Mr Mos## co## vici is just as clear about Buch## a## rest &apos;## s fail## ing## s as it make## s it## s way to Bru## ssels , and we sincere## ly appreci## ate the way in which he ha## s done this , quit## e right## ly trac## ing Roman## ia &apos;## s short## coming## s in term## s of all the access## ion crite## ria , including the political conditio## ns . 
in the discuss## ion of pre## vi## ous report## s of this House about Roman## ia as a candid## ate country , I ask## ed for attention to be paid to viol## ations of the free## dom of the press . 
un## fortunate## ly , this report mention## s these viol## ations again in Paragraph 8 . 
it is as plain as day that there is physic## al aggress## ion again## st investig## ative journal## ists , and that the govern## ment exert## s pressure on financial## ly weak media . 
in hi## s re## cent book &apos; Threat## ened journal## ists , beaten journal## ists , &quot; the author and journal## ist Mal## in Bo## t confirm## ed this depress## ing im## age . 
the book is an out## right indict## ment of the prevail## ing press restrain## t in Roman## ia . 
Mr Bas## es## c## u and hi## s political sympath## isers there## fore have the## ir work cut out . 
incident## ally , in our region## s , in Western Europe , we should take note of what Mal## in Bo## t ha## s to say about the dub## ious role of Western publish## ers who have b## ought up man## y Roman## ian paper## s , and who , in hi## s word## s , &apos; do not come to Roman## ia to defend demo## cracy , but simpl## y to make money . &quot; 
I hope that a new Roman## ian Govern## ment take## s the European access## ion crite## ria entire## ly serious## ly from the word go . 
in the final ana## lysis , it is not fair to blame them for the commit## ments that have not be## en com## plied with by the Nastase govern## ment . 
this list is long and weight## y . 
more## over , time go## es on ; it is fortunate , with the desir## ed access## ion d## ate of 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 in mind , that the in## coming President Bas## es## c## u realis## es this all too well . 
that is why he deserve## s all our attention and support in this un## doubt## ed## ly difficult period . 
this House expect## s the Commission to strict## ly enforce the securit## y mechan## ism agree## d upon with Buch## a## rest . 
to finish off , I should like to draw Buch## a## rest &apos;## s attention to one paragraph in the Mos## co## vici report : &apos; call## s on it to speed up the restitution of proper## ty and adopt legisl## ation on the restitution of church## es . &quot; 
at the same time , I would ask the Council and Commission to close## ly monitor the implement## ation of this long drawn @## -## @ out issue . 
the Dutch Presidency ha## s al## read## y ma## de a pledge to that effect to it## s own parliament . 
in a fine review in a Germa## n qual## ity news## paper yesterday , I read a raz## or @## -## @ s## harp satir## e on the political degener## ation of Roman## ia under post @## -## @ Communist rule . 
the author apt## ly paro## died the title of Pr## ime Minister Nastase &apos;## s campaign document entitle## d : &apos; from Karl Marx to Co## ca @## -## @ Col## a , &quot; claim## ing that a document entitle## d &apos; From Karl Marx to Al Cap## one &quot; would be just as truthful . 
we ver## y much hope that Roman## ia , under President Bas## es## c## u , will break this persist## ent political spell . 
the surprising out## come of the second round of the p## resident## ial elect## ions appear## s to be an encourag## ing sign of this . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the New Italia## n Socialist Part## y wish## es the in## coming President Bas## es## c## u all the best in hi## s work . 
the count## less young Roman## ians who have support## ed him over re## cent month## s and are jubil## ant## ly fill## ing the square## s and street## s of Buch## a## rest and the rest of the country are , regard## less of the## ir political affil## i## ations , pinning on him the## ir hope## s for change and for a different , new and better futur## e . 
Mr Bas## es## c## u ha## s a difficult and y## et ra## ther ex## citing task a## head of him : to steer hi## s country on the new course## s of modern## isation , anti @## -## @ corrupt## ion measure## s and full compliance with human and civil right## s , as well as the per## man## ent adopt## ion of democratic structure## s . 
we hope - or ra## ther , we are s## ure - that the end of that journey can on## ly be the total integration of Roman## ia in## to the political and socio## economic bloc of the European Union . 
while we note with satisf## action the go## al## s that have be## en achiev## ed , our task over the remain## ing two year## s will be to ensu## re that concrete , real and significant improve## ments are ma## de in the man## y area## s that s## till fall short of European standard## s . 
I refer in particular to the qualitative leap that is ur## gent## ly need## ed in the field of human right## s , e## special## ly with regard to the re## quest## s of the Roma minor## ity , which often suffer## s discrimin## ation with the acquiesc## ence of govern## ment author## ities . 
the Roma make up 2.5 million citizen## s who live on the edge## s of soci## ety in total## ly un## accept## able conditio## ns . 
I also refer to the re## quest## s and aspi## rations of the Hung## arian minor## ity , which consist## s of 1.5 million people ; the treat## ment of the dis## able## d ; the shame## ful conditio## n of the health infra## structure , e## special## ly th## ose facilit## ies hou## s## ing patient## s with mental problem## s ; the viol## ent method## s and actual physic## al abuse practise## d by the force## s of law and order ; a judicial system that fail## s to meet the crite## ria of efficiency and in## depend## ence ; as well as media that are s## till not entire## ly free . 
on visit## ing the country , I was s## truck and disturb## ed by the man## y - too man## y - child## ren wander## ing the street## s al## one . 
we must demand a concrete commit## ment from the govern## ment on this issue . 
it is a legal and moral oblig## ation , not an opt## ion . 
every## thing possible ha## s to be done , th## en , to ensu## re that every child in Roman## ia , as in Europe and the rest of the world , ha## s the right to a peace## ful , happy child## hood and the right to s## mile with hope for the futur## e . 
Mr President , I have be## en a Roman## ia @## -## @ watch## er for f## ive year## s now , ever since I took up the case of a London con## stituent of mine , Prince Carol M## ir## ce## a . 
he demonst## rated clear## ly to me that the Roman## ian Govern## ment , through it## s Prosecutor General , had repeat## ed## ly inter## ven## ed on one side - alleg## ed## ly under instruct## ions from President Iliescu - of the civil case again## st Carol &apos;## s half brother , ex @## -## @ K## ing Michael of Roman## ia . 
I was there## fore particular## ly de## light## ed at see## ing the in## depend## ence of the Roman## ian justice system . 
not on## ly ha## s Roman## ia now abolish## ed the Soviet @## -## @ er## a right for the state to inter## vene in civil case## s , but re## cent## ly , when the pre## vi## ous govern## ment tri## ed to circumvent the royal palace &apos;## s proper## ty claim disput## e by a bill of compens## ation in the Parliament , the Sen## ate threw it out , citing the fact that it was be## fore the Sup## reme Court . 
s## o , thing## s are im## prov## ing in term## s of the in## depend## ence of Roman## ia &apos;## s justice system . 
clear## ly , Mr Bas## es## c## u &apos;## s victor## y in the p## resident## ial elect## ions show## s that Roman## ia is also mov## ing rapid## ly forward in reform term## s . 
the surprise result definite## ly scotch## ed all the alleg## ations that the elect## ion would be stole## n by cheat## ing by the author## ities . 
Roman## ia is far from perfect and the fight again## st corrupt## ion and organise## d crime will be priorit## y number one for the new govern## ment . 
more work need## s to be done on minor## ity right## s , including the large Roma population and the Hung## arian population . 
also let me make a ple## a again## st a rigid im## position of the mora## torium again## st foreign child adopt## ions , as man## y fami## lies from countries as divers## e as I## ta## ly and Israel have develop## ed bond## s with child## ren in orphan## age## s . 
it would be cruel and in## human## e to terminate the process arbitrari## ly at this late s## tage . 
I welcome the Roman## ian Govern## ment &apos;## s decision to establish an international committee to resolv## e this delicate issue . 
as V## ice @## -## @ President of the Ukraine Deleg## ation , I believ## e that out## standing disput## es s## uch as the issue of territorial claim## s by Roman## ia over tin## y S## na## ke Island in the B## lack Sea , which is current## ly under Ukrainian control , need to be resolv## ed be## fore 20## 07 . 
here , the owner## ship of the exclus## ive economic interest zone is essential , as oil is believ## ed to be present . 
good relation## s with Ukraine , which is now establish## ing it## self as a fully @## -## @ fledg## ed European demo## cracy , are import## ant for the futur## e . 
an## other issue is the border area of the Dan## u## be Del## ta , where there are concern## s that a Ukrainian @## -## @ built navig## able channel is up## setting the surround## ing wet## land## s and hence also the un## ique local habitat for rare bird spec## ies . 
more dis## tant is the whole issue of co## oper## ating with and stabilis## ing Moldova and the Transnistria question that go## es with it . 
interest## ing## ly , if Mr Y## us## c## henko come## s to power in Ki## ev on 26 Dec## ember , the days for the Tiras## pol regime of Transnistria are number## ed , hence the Russia## ns &apos; desir## e to den## y Mr Y## us## c## henko victor## y . 
ha## s any## body investig## ated whet## her the Tiras## pol regime may also have had a role to play in the poison## ing of Mr Y## us## c## henko ? 
I believ## e Roman## ia will be read## y to join the European Union by 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 with Bulgaria . 
I welcome bo## th as EU Member State## s , al## though I do not see the two as chrono## logical## ly coup## led auto## matic## ally . 
last## ly , of course , there are the safeguard clause## s which allow d## ate slip## page if Roman## ia fall## s short of it## s require## ments under the ; but n## ever## the## less I fully support the Mos## co## vici report and look forward to Roman## ia join## ing us in the 25 Member State## s by 20## 07 . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to congratul## ate Mr Mos## co## vici on hi## s ver## y object## ive and well @## -## @ balance## d report . 
I fully agree with Mr Re## hn and Mr Nicolaï , who I feel have express## ed ver## y object## ive opinion## s . 
Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion is benefic## ial to Hung## ary for two reason## s ; on the one hand , good neighbour## liness , and on the other , the issue of the minor## ity Hung## arian communit## y , with more th## an half a million Hung## arian## s liv## ing in Roman## ia . 
that is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Roman## ia to accede in two year## s &quot; time . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to thank the Nastase Govern## ment , which ha## s done a great deal to bring about the histo## ric re## conciliation between Roman## ia and Hung## ary . 
today we have a strategic partner## ship . 
it is tru## e that in all honest## y much remain## s to be done , but consider## able progress ha## s be## en ma## de over the last ten year## s . 
I should like to stress three key issue## s that need to be resolv## ed . 
the first is genuine de## central## isation , and a real d## evolve## ment of power to the region## s . 
the next is the protection of the environment , as clean river## s are a cross @## -## @ border issue . 
final## ly , there is the question of the minor## ities , the Roma and the Hung## arian## s . 
I do not wish to make the implement## ation of different form## s of auto## nomy a pre## requisite to Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion , but it would be helpful to open negoti## ations with the new govern## ment , name## ly tri## partite negoti## ations between the Roman## ian Govern## ment , the Hung## arian parliament## ary party and the Hung## arian Govern## ment , as was done in the case of South Tyrol and the Å## land Island## s in Fin## land . 
the European Union offer## s helpful precede## nts here . 
it would there## fore be desir## able to start the negoti## ations , and I fully support Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion with## out delay . 
it is per## hap## s Roman## ia that ha## s the wor## st leg## acy of all the former communist countries . 
Ceaucescu and hi## s associate## s destroy## ed the country , ruin## ed it## s econom## y , fragment## ed it## s soci## ety and intimid## ated it## s citizen## s . 
the last fifteen year## s are far from be## ing a success story as the postpone## ment of reform## s waste## d sever## al valu## able year## s . 
I there## fore hope that the new## ly @## -## @ elect## ed leader## s , President and Govern## ment of Roman## ia will set about fac## ing the challenge## s be## fore them with re## double## d ef## fort . 
there are two task## s that I e## special## ly would like to mention . 
the first one , where there are consider## able defi## ci## encies , is the social integration of the Roman## ian Roman## y minor## ity com## prising of over two million people , who are in a ver## y difficult situ## ation . 
the second one is giving a high## er priorit## y to environment## al issue## s , since the state of the environment in Roman## ia is far be## hind that of the other candid## ate countries . 
regulation## s not on## ly have to be adopt## ed , but the## y have to be implement## ed as well . 
let me remind you of the ver## y danger## ous min## ing project of Ro## s## ia Mont## ana , threaten## ing us with sever## e environment## al disaster . 
the road that lead## s to the comp## let## ion of negoti## ations is long and rug## ged , and I congratul## ate Roman## ia &apos;## s leader## ship on the## ir success . 
from now on it should focus on adopt## ing the . 
I hope Roman## ia will ful## fil the oblig## ations and will become a member state in 20## 07 . 
this is in our interest and in Roman## ia &apos;## s interest . 
I there## fore think that Mr Bas## es## c## u &apos;## s demand that two chap## ter## s should be reopen## ed for negoti## ations is high## ly risk## y . 
it jeopard## ises Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion in 20## 07 , and delay is not in the interest of either Roman## ia , or the European Union . 
Roman## ia ha## s ma## de great sacrifice## s in order to be able to work to## ward## s be## coming a member of the Union . 
I firm## ly believ## e that it is in our best interest that Roman## ia join## s as s## oon as 20## 07 , and Roman## ia must realis## e that sever## al oblig## ations simpl## y must be fulfill## ed on the way . 
this is why I find this topic s## o cruc## ial and ask the Commission## er and the Commission to continu## ously monitor Roman## ia &apos;## s progress in this matter , as it is not on## ly in our best interest but also in the interest of Roman## ian citizen## s . 
Mr President , in the environment## al sphere , Roman## ia at present lag## s ver## y far be## hind in term## s of what is require## d by EU legisl## ation . 
in spite of the fact that it ha## s be## en give## n ver## y long transit## ional period## s where import## ant environment## al regulation## s are concern## ed , it ha## s not implement## ed different legisl## ation . 
where , in a number of area## s , s## uch legisl## ation ha## s in actual fact be## en enact## ed , it ha## s be## en s## o on paper but not in practice . 
last year , we s## ent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety to the Department of the Environment in Buch## a## rest . 
the delegation examin## ed quit## e a few of the more controversial project## s , and our view was confirm## ed : the pace of reform in the environment## al sphere need## s ur## gent## ly to be step## ped up . 
there is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular eye on over the next few year## s . 
it concern## s Ro## s## ia Mont## ana , a propos## al to construct Europe &apos;## s large## st gold mine in Roman## ia . 
it is a project that will have huge environment## al repercussion## s . 
a## mong other thing## s , large quant## ities of cyanide will be us## ed in this sensitiv## e area . 
the issue is that of whet## her Roman## ia will comp## ly with current EU legisl## ation , for ex## ample the provision## s govern## ing environment## al impact assess## ments and the water direct## ive . 
the issue is also that of whet## her Roman## ia will success## fully comp## ly with the forth## coming new direct## ive on waste from mine## s and it## s environment## al repercussion## s . 
I should like to call upon the Commission to examin## e the Ro## s## ia Mont## ana project particular## ly care## fully to see if there re## ally is success## ful compliance with the EU &apos;## s environment## al require## ments , which I consider to be mini## mum standard## s and one## s with which compliance is also be## ing demand## ed by the local population in the area . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I join in with the man## y posit## ive comment## s ma## de to the rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici , regard## ing the balance of hi## s report . 
while not ignor## ing any of the critical area## s in the process of Roman## ia &apos;## s prepar## ation to join the European Union , the report show## s a clear appreci## ation of the not## able ef## fort## s ma## de and the result## s - albeit s## till partial - achiev## ed by Roman## ia in that process . 
this morning , with great aplomb , this Parliament ga## ve the green light to the procedure for Tur## key &apos;## s prepar## ation to join the European Union . 
I am in favour of Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion for exact## ly the same reason## s that have led me to express my strong hostil## ity to Tur## key &apos;## s ent## ry . 
Roman## ia is Europe ; Roman## ia ha## s a civil and political soci## ety bas## ed on value## s which , de## spite the## ir un## deni## able high## s and low## s , have to be regard## ed as perfect## ly compar## able to the value## s on which the European Union is bas## ed . 
certain area## s in which basic measure## s are s## till need## ed certain## ly deserve encourag## e## ment and support . 
the## y include the multi## annual anti @## -## @ crime strate## gy , the state aid issue ( a subject particular## ly close to the heart## s of us liberal## ists ) , the sensitiv## e question of the return of proper## ty and church## es , as well as the modern## isation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a soci## ety s## uch as Europe &apos;## s , which is character## ised by system## s that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state . 
I have just listen## ed to the speech by a spokes## man for a political party that vot## ed for the access## ion of Tur## key , who repeat## ed the harsh remark## s ma## de by N## GO## s about respect for human right## s in Roman## ia . 
I should like to have heard the same observ## ations ma## de about Tur## key as well : in that case the## y would have be## en decide## d## ly more just## ified . 
it is , how## ever , absolut## e## ly necess## ary to call the Roman## ian author## ities &quot; attention to the ur## gent question of illegal im## migration . 
one Member ha## s refer## red to the child## ren , who understand## ably had an emotional effect on him d## uring a visit to Roman## ia . 
I do not need to go to Roman## ia , be## cause you just need to drive a## round the street## s of Tur## in , Mi## lan , Genoa and Rome to see Roman## ian child## ren exploit## ed by criminal organisation## s . 
we have to put a stop to illegal im## migration , and Roman## ia ha## s to defend it## s external border## s and active## ly collabo## rate in stamp## ing out this activity , which does no credit to the civil## isation of Eugen Ion## es## c## u , M## ir## ce## a E## lia## de and the man## y other great writer## s and think## ers of a civil## isation that we feel is close to us and which we share . 
Roman## ia &apos;## s citizen## s have a place in the European Union , there is no question about it . 
one of the reason## s why we mutual## ly need e## ach other is be## cause through access## ion , the under## ly## ing principle## s of the Union , de## central## isation and local self @## -## @ govern## ment may help improve prospect## s for the futur## e of the Hung## arian minor## ity there , including one and a half million people . 
the question is about fulfill## ing commit## ments : will Roman## ia be able to adopt the that all Member State## s are oblig## ed to ful## fil ? 
the Union seem## s to be more leni## ent to## ward## s Roman## ia th## an it was to## ward## s th## ose countries that join## ed in May . 
Mr Mos## co## vici &apos;## s report critical## ly examin## es how Roman## ia ha## s met the crite## ria s## o far . 
I would like to compliment him on hi## s s## kill at compromis## e , as he include## d sever## al of my propos## ed amend## ments in## to hi## s report , making hi## s argument## s firm## er . 
the report examin## es area## s of sever## e de## ficit : the in## depend## ence of judicial proceed## ing## s , the discrimin## atory legisl## ation on elect## ion right## s and the return of ecclesiastic## al good## s . 
let me take this even a step further and point out some of Roman## ia &apos;## s defi## ci## encies in fulfill## ing the C## open## hagen crite## ria , high## light## ed by the elect## ion @## -## @ relate## d abuse on N## ov## ember 28 . 
as a Hung## arian delegate , I feel oblig## ated to list the tempo## rary exempt## ions in the field of environment## al protection that Roman## ia ask## ed for . 
Hung## arian## s are ap## prehens## ive about these exempt## ions , as the## y would have a direct effect on the qual## ity of water in Hung## ary and thu## s have re## quest## ed that the Hung## arian Govern## ment reopen## ed chap## ter## s of environment## al protection , which have just re## cent## ly be## en closed . 
it is exact## ly be## cause of the un## certain## ties of s## uch commit## ments that I would like to emphasis## e how import## ant it is to monitor strict## ly the period between sign## ing the access## ion treat## y and the actual time of access## ion . 
if necess## ary , the process## es of the two candid## ate countries should be separat## ed and the## y should receiv## e individual perform## ance @## -## @ bas## ed evalu## ation . 
regular progress check## s are ver## y import## ant , and Parliament must also take part in this process , s## o that by the time Roman## ia join## s the Union , we can feel re## assure## d and confident as to the## ir prepar## ed## ness . 
I belong to th## ose who most sincere## ly hope that our doubt## s will be scatter## ed by Roman## ia &apos;## s posit## ive perform## ance in the near futur## e . 
Mr President , in my view , last Sunday &apos;## s p## resident## ial elect## ions have in## de## ed demonst## rated that demo## cracy in Roman## ia is ver## y vibr## ant and is also work## ing well . 
this ha## s not al## ways be## en the case , and s## o we have every reason to be grat## ified . 
let us hope that the dynamic force## s which have now be## en re## lease## d will genuine## ly be channel## led in## to driv## ing forward the reform## s and that the political process in Buch## a## rest will not be obstruct## ed . 
all we can do is hope . 
I was a member of the Deleg## ation to the EU @## -## @ Roman## ia Jo## int Parliament## ary Committee from 19## 99 to 20## 04 . 
if we compar## e 19## 99 and today , the country ha## s obvi## ously ma## de substanti## al progress . 
not## with## standing all the critic## ism in specific area## s , it must be s## aid that the pre## vi## ous govern## ment under Anastas## e achiev## ed a great deal for Roman## ia . 
major progress ha## s genuine## ly be## en ma## de in man## y area## s . 
how## ever , we can## not ignor## e the fact that the Roman## ians s## till have a lot to do . 
not en## ough ha## s be## en done to achiev## e the standard## s that app## ly through## out the European Union . 
I can on## ly repeat what man## y of my fellow Member## s have s## aid : an in## dependent judic## iary - which mean## s a judic## iary which is in## dependent of the executive and individual political force## s - is in fact a pre## requisite for Roman## ia &apos;## s co## operation with## in the EU . 
there is s## till some ground to be ma## de up here . 
I also hope that corrupt## ion can be combat## ed more effective## ly . 
corrupt## ion is robber## y at the expense of Roman## ia &apos;## s citizen## s , and the new President ha## s pledge## d major anti @## -## @ corrupt## ion measure## s which will hope## fully target not on## ly the &apos; small f## ry &apos; but also the big fish . 
corrupt## ion must be tackle## d ir## respect## ive of position or status , for it is theft from the Roman## ian people . 
in my view , it would be quit## e wrong for Roman## ia or the EU to creat## e new obstacle## s at this point in time . 
the negoti## ations should be conclude## d , and I would like to thank Mr Mos## co## vici , the rapporteur , for present## ing s## uch an excel## lent report . 
20## 07 must be the d## ate when we welcome Roman## ia in## to the European fami## ly , and thu## s integrate it in## to European standard## s as well . 
Mr President , let me be clear . 
I am ver## y much in favour of Roman## ia ac## ceding , but all in good time and prefer## ably in accord## ance with the agree## ments ma## de . 
in order to complete the negoti## ations , it simpl## y need## s to ful## fil the prescribe## d conditio## ns and crite## ria , s## o it is quit## e beyond me why the Commission should , with a straight face , claim that Roman## ia meet## s the C## open## hagen political crite## ria , while at the same time it report## s extens## ive## ly on the influence the executive power exert## s over the out## come of court case## s and confirm## s that corrupt## ion is s## till rife and discrimin## ation - including that again## st the Roma - is s## till ver## y much on the age## nda . 
it appear## s that this House &apos;## s rapporteur , too , does not have any problem with stating in the first paragraph of hi## s report that Roman## ia meet## s the political crite## ria , while going on , later on in the report - and right## ly s## o - to express hi## s concern about a few cruc## ial point## s . 
the rapporteur go## es on to draw the conclusion - which I regard as im## prob## able - that a satisfactory conclusion of the negoti## ations be## fore the end of 20## 04 is bo## th desir## able and feasible . 
my common sense lead## s me to a complete## ly different conclusion , name## ly that Roman## ia ha## s not gone that far y## et and , con## sequent## ly , negoti## ations can## not be conclude## d satisfactorily be## fore the end of 20## 04 . 
we have table## d Amendment No 7 for that purpose . 
our Amendment## s No## s 6 and 25 are also import## ant ; Amendment No 6 under## line## s that the progress of all candid## ate countries is dependent on the assess## ment of the## ir own merit## s and that it is for this reason that the use of individual access## ion agree## ments as a bas## is for the access## ion of Roman## ia and Bulgaria is re## commend## ed . 
amend## ment No 25 does the necess## ary job of bring## ing paragraph 1 of the report back in## to line with re## ality . 
I sincere## ly hope that we can count on your support s## o that we can get through to the European Council be## fore it is too late , be## cause it ha## s just be## en confirm## ed again that the Council ha## s now complete## d the formal negoti## ations with Roman## ia . 
it follow## s that this debate and tomor## row &apos;## s vot## e are stag## ed perform## ance## s , but , be## fore the access## ion agree## ment is sign## ed in the spring of 20## 05 , Parliament must give it## s express approval , and I do not see that as be## ing by any mean## s a . 
I would see it as a good thing if this House we## re to s## peak out clear## ly about the pre## mature and artificial closure of the negoti## ations with Roman## ia , if it we## re to be able to put a stop to the consider## able arbitrari## ness in the enlarge## ment process and if it we## re to keep to the agree## ments ma## de . 
the work## ing method that we now see in the process with Roman## ia will , s## oon## er or later , result in the ero## s## ion of our communit## y bas## ed on the rule of law and in the weaken## ing of the Union . 
Mr President , the Ju## ne List will welcome Roman## ia and Bulgaria as Member## s of the European Union , just as we s## hall welcome Tur## key , the countries of the Western Balkan## s and , in time , Ukraine and , hope## fully , Belarus . 
at the same time , we wish to warn of the problem## s that will be fac## ed by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member State## s in the ver## y short term - poor and economic## ally un## develop## ed countries with limit## ed experience of demo## cracy and the rule of law and with large problem## s involv## ing corrupt## ion . 
the EU is construct## ed for economic## ally develop## ed countries with s## table demo## cracies and on## ly moderate problem## s with corrupt## ion . 
the enlarge## ment involv## ing ten countries that ha## s just be## en car## ried out and of which the Ju## ne List was a sincere support## er is , al## read## y for it## s part , cau## s## ing problem## s . 
accept## ing poor countries s## uch as Roman## ia in## to an EU that continu## es to operate an absurd agri## cultural policy and a poor## ly manage## d structural policy and that is it## self wrest## ling with difficult## ies in prevent## ing waste and corrupt## ion in it## s own system would be danger## ous for the futur## e of the European project . 
it might also prove danger## ous for Roman## ia . 
there would be a significant risk of a brain drain . 
enter## ing the EU &apos;## s agri## cultural system and be## ing lock## ed tight## ly in## to an economic structure with## out a futur## e would also be a big dis## advantage . 
the elect## ion that ha## s just take## n place was , how## ever , a big success for demo## cracy in Roman## ia , but bo## th Roman## ia and the EU countries have reason## s to wait and see and not to push for pre## mature access## ion . 
it may be in the interest## s of bo## th part## ies not to rush in## to full member## ship . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I thank the rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici , for giving us a balance## d report , which point## s out the advance## s ma## de by Roman## ia in re## cent year## s . 
Bar## o## ness N## icholson of W## inter## bourn## e di## d well to recall the position from which Roman## ia start## ed and the reason## s that have ma## de progress s## o difficult for that country . 
even s## o , Mr Mos## co## vici ha## s also point## ed out the limit## ations and short## coming## s that character## ise Roman## ia &apos;## s situ## ation today . 
some Member## s from countries that join## ed the European Union on 1 May this year have call## ed for great## er sever## ity . 
I should like them to re## read what was s## aid in this Chamber be## fore the## ir countries join## ed , when we we## re look## ing at how far the## y had progress## ed on the## ir path to## ward## s join## ing the Union . 
in all like## lihood the## y s## till had consider## able short## coming## s at that s## tage but , even s## o , it was thought appropriate that the## y should be allow## ed to join at the agree## d time . 
in the case of Roman## ia , we also have a safeguard clause , which was not provid## ed in the other case## s . 
I there## fore believ## e it is on## ly fair to give that country the chance to do it## s ut## most over the next two year## s s## o that it can be read## y when the time come## s to actual## ly join our Union . 
there is no doubt that there are topic## s about which our fellow citizen## s are concern## ed , the most import## ant of which is the in## adequacy of the fight again## st organise## d crime . 
if we we## re to ask people in the street## s of our countries to say how afraid the## y often felt of criminal gang## s , we would s## ure## ly be incline## d to encourag## e the Roman## ian Govern## ment to do more in that direct## ion . 
as Mr Le## in## en right## ly recall## ed , the fight again## st corrupt## ion is wide## spread in the countries join## ing our Union . 
I should also like to touch on the topic of child## ren . 
this is a subject that I have address## ed extens## ive## ly in re## cent year## s , together with Bar## o## ness N## icholson . 
child protection issue## s need to be plac## ed at the heart of our think## ing . 
I believ## e , how## ever , that the propos## al put forward by the rapporteur of having an international commission is a good solution . 
if we want to prevent th## ose child## ren from spend## ing the## ir adolesc## ence and youth on the street## s of our c## ities or shut up in institution## s , we have to take in## to account the doz## ens of fami## lies that have al## read## y ma## de contact with them and would love to be able to give them affect## ion . 
let us there## fore welcome Mr Mos## co## vici &apos;## s suggest## ion to that effect . 
last## ly , Mr President , we need to consider the import## ance of st## ability . 
we s## hall see whet## her the out## come of the re## cent elect## ions in Buch## a## rest will lead to political st## ability . 
I believ## e that that is what we all wish for , be## cause on## ly with st## ability can there be any hope of see## ing Roman## ia read## y to meet it## s commit## ments . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , I start## ed my care## er as a teacher of modern language## s , and when I was mark## ing ex## am## s or home## work I realis## ed that I would become increas## ing## ly harsh as I w## ent on , and that I would be much tough## er on the last paper## s th## an I had be## en on the first - to s## uch a point that I would take an## other look at the first one## s to make s## ure that I had be## en sufficient## ly fair . 
listen## ing to this debate and hear## ing what some Member## s have to say , and also recall## ing this morning &apos;## s debate , I wonder whet## her we are not ex## peri## enc## ing some## thing similar here , be## cause it seem## s to me that we are be## coming increas## ing## ly harsh with e## ach enlarge## ment . 
is this to say that there are no problem## s ? 
of course not . 
I mention## ed them and our rapporteur ha## s clear## ly indic## ated where the## y lie , and s## aid that consider## able improve## ments are essential . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , I am fair## ly well acquaint## ed with Roman## ia and have had the opportun## ity on sever## al occasion## s to urge th## ose in position## s of author## ity from all political side## s to speed up work on implement## ing the reform## s and trans## posing the necess## ary legisl## ation and regulation . 
like the major## ity of the member## s of my group , I will be vot## ing in favour of the re## commend## ations in the Mos## co## vici report . 
I will be do## ing s## o not on## ly be## cause of my feel## ing## s for Roman## ia , where I have man## y excel## lent friend## s , but also be## cause , having visit## ed the country as long ago as Fe## bru## ary 19## 90 and seen fresh evidence of the viol## ence of the end of the pre## vi## ous year , I can fully appreci## ate how far it ha## s al## read## y come . 
we owe our friend## s understand## ing and friend## ship , but not weak or al## most in## different indulg## ence . 
this ha## s al## ways be## en my att## itude to## ward## s Roman## ia , and it remain## s my att## itude today . 
my posit## ive att## itude remain## s fundamental## ly an att## itude of vigil## ant friend## ship . 
I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I believ## e that more honest## y is call## ed for . 
I am most grat## e## ful to Mr Lage## ndijk for hi## s demand in this respect , even though we have arriv## ed at different conclusion## s for Tur## key . 
he is absolut## e## ly right : we must demand honest## y in relation to Roman## ia as well . 
in my view , this obvi## ously mean## s that we must dispens## e with a few of our dogma## s . 
the first is that dead## line## s which have be## en moot## ed at some point in the past are now regard## ed as more sacr## ed th## an the progress ma## de or the real## ities of the situ## ation . 
let me be blunt . we will not do our## selves any favour## s if we abide by 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 as a d## ate for Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion . 
second## ly - and Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , I am direct## ing these remark## s specific## ally to you , as we had the pleas## ure of discuss## ing the budget , a## mong other thing## s , with you - we are talk## ing about a period for which we s## till have no budget , as we have y## et to adopt a new Fina## ncial Perspective to cover the period from 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
if you cl## ing to your second dogma , name## ly the figure of 1 % , we will be un## able to cope with this financial burden . 
we can## not argue that Europe is continu## ally expand## ing and it## s age## nda is be## coming long## er , while money is be## coming increas## ing## ly tight . 
pleas## e be honest and make it clear that there is no fund## ing . 
we need to negotiate the Fina## ncial Perspective first , and th## en we will see whet## her every## thing add## s up . 
t## hirdly - and again , let me be blunt - I have heard every speaker talk about the problem## s which we s## till have to over## come , not us , that is , but Roman## ia , name## ly corrupt## ion , demo## cracy and the rule of law . 
just what do we mean when we talk about member## ship of the European Union ? 
is this not the precondition , as we learn## ed today at n## oon ? 
accord## ing to the major## ity of Member## s of this House , this is not the precondition for the open## ing of negoti## ations . 
I take a different view . 
ultimate## ly , how## ever , be## fore we are hand## ed an access## ion treat## y - and we have be## en told that this will be avail## able with## in the next six month## s - every## thing ha## s to be in place . 
we are deceiv## ing our## selves if we proceed on the bas## is that monitor## ing process## es and clause## s which are built in but will n## ever come in## to force be## cause the## y require un## anim## ity in the Council are en## ough to just## ify our con## fidence and convince us that every## thing will work out just fine . 
that is why I am appeal## ing to you , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , in relation to the draft## ing of the preside## ncy conclusion## s on Fri## day . 
I realis## e that you have a problem in that you have li## ttle to show for your preside## ncy . 
how## ever , no one is reproach## ing you : d## uring the six month## s in which you held the preside## ncy , Europe was oper## ating be## low par . 
we had the European elect## ions , and th## en it took some time for the Commission to be appoint## ed and confirm## ed in office . 
no one can blame the preside## ncy for this . 
how## ever , you are respons## ible for ens## uring that we do not deceiv## e our## selves every six month## s . 
that mean## s that we should not claim , in Council document## s , that significant progress ha## s be## en ma## de and improve## ments have y## et again be## en achiev## ed when this is not the case . 
I there## fore appeal to you to be honest when you draw up the preside## ncy conclusion## s on Fri## day . 
I appeal to the House as well : let us take an honest vot## e on this issue tomor## row . 
Mr President , we like to talk about a Europe of value## s . 
how does this fit with the decision to admit Roman## ia to the European Union in just two year## s time un## less by some chance there should be a defer## ral of just 12 month## s , which hard## ly seem## s like## ly give## n that we have heard today that the Council ha## s over## ridd## en the Commission &apos;## s concern## s in closing chap## ter## s , a deplor## able ex## ample of over principle of which the Dutch preside## ncy should be ashamed . 
one of my colleague## s s## aid that we are be## ing too sever## e on Roman## ia . 
how soft does s## he want us to be ? 
on the Commission &apos;## s own admiss## ion , Roman## ia suffer## s from serious and wide## spread corrupt## ion ; it ha## s a judic## iary which is n## either efficient nor in## dependent ; it does not possess genuine media free## dom ; it can## not implement the at local and regional level ; it fail## s to prevent money launder## ing ; it permit## s the ill @## -## @ treat## ment of prison## ers in custo## dy ; it fail## s to enforce law## s again## st child and sexual traffick## ing . 
y## et this is a country ap## parent## ly now s## o close to meet## ing EU value## s that we are put## ting it on a certain course to access## ion . 
it is not surprising that the EU may stand accus## ed of be## ing un## able to say &apos; no &apos; to any## one when it set## s it## s sight## s s## o low . 
the Commission## er say## s , and I quote from hi## s re## cent parliament## ary answer : &apos; it seem## s like## ly that Roman## ia &apos;## s futur## e progress will be accele## rated by it## s access## ion to the EU &apos; . 
how## ever , n## either he nor any of us know whet## her that will prove tru## e . 
s## o far we have be## en luck## y : member## ship of the European Union ha## s tend## ed to make bad apple## s whole## some but per## hap## s we will reach the point where the bad apple## s infect the rest . 
you on## ly have to look at Lithuania , near the top of the world league for corrupt## ion , or to the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , lock## ing up people with## out charge or trial , to realis## e that Europe can ver## y easi## ly allow it## s value## s to be betray## ed from with## in . 
we do not have in place an effective mechan## ism for deal## ing with exist## ing Member State## s that quiet## ly reject the principle## s of good govern## ance . 
per## hap## s the Commission## er can take a lead in build## ing s## uch a mechan## ism . 
I wish the new Roman## ian Govern## ment well . 
the result## s of last Sunday &apos;## s elect## ion give hope for reform , al## though the result was no thank## s either to the Commission or the Council , bo## th of which play## ed right in## to the hand## s of the former cynic## al govern## ment . 
Roman## ia &apos;## s problem## s run deep . 
o## nce appli## cant## s are allow## ed through the EU door , the Commission is depriv## ed of it## s best weapon## s to secure change . 
in## stead of us## ing the opportun## ity to app## ly maxim## um pressure to gain reform , we seem determine## d to set it on a convey## or belt to auto## matic access## ion . 
Roman## ia should join the European Union , but it should do when it meet## s the value## s of the EU . 
it would be a grave mistake to set a d## ate for access## ion now . 
- Mr President , may## be Bulgaria and Roman## ia are be## ing wrong## ed by our deba## ting Tur## key &apos;## s access## ion prospect## s over the last few days in the European Parliament - and s## hall also be do## ing s## o in the European Union , at the European Council , in a few days &apos; time . 
I believ## e that forecast## s on the subject of Tur## key are over## shadow## ing bo## th the express## ion and the weight## ing of our political word . 
I should like to start by refer## ring to a topic## al matter , the final## isation yesterday of the result## s of the elect## ions in Roman## ia . 
the new President ha## s be## en name## d and the result## s of the elect## ion have be## en accept## ed by hi## s fellow candid## ate , put## ting an end to any disput## es re## l## ating to the elector## al process . 
non## e## the## less , the new President will have to achiev## e the strong back## ing of parliament if he is to honour im## mediate## ly the commit## ments which Roman## ia ha## s give## n to the European Union . 
give## n the al## most balance## d pre## s## ence of the main political force## s in the Roman## ian parliament , co## operation a## mong## st every## one and serious joint ef## fort## s will be need## ed for the success## ful continu## ation of European integration . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , by my read## ing , Roman## ia ha## s ma## de significant progress , e## special## ly in s## uch a short space of time , in coming in## to line with political and economic access## ion crite## ria . 
non## e## the## less , we should not over## look the need for further radical reform , focus## ing on the efficient combat## ing of corrupt## ion and change## s in the public administ## ration and in the judicial system , in the aim of sec## uring tru## ly in## dependent justice . 
in add## ition , further measure## s need to be take## n in the sector## s of border control## s , asy## lum and im## migration policy and more drastic action to combat organise## d crime and corrupt## ion . 
at economic level , it is consider## ed necess## ary , , to safeguard macro @## -## @ economic st## ability , rational## ise the role of the state in the econom## y and introduce efficient regional and r## ural development poli## cies and poli## cies for great## er regional integration and co## operation with the countries of south @## -## @ eastern Europe . 
my personal appraisal is that , with the support of the European Commission and with the precondition , of course , of more intens## e ef## fort , it is feasible that Roman## ia will be able to comp## ly more fully with the crite## ria and the value## s and principle## s of the Union and sign an access## ion agree## ment at the same time as Bulgaria . 
Mr President , first## ly I wish to thank my colleague , Mr Mos## co## vici , for an excel## lent report , and one that take## s account of different point## s of view . 
candid## ate countries must be treat## ed equal## ly and fair## ly . 
Roman## ia must ful## fil the conditio## ns impose## d on it , just as the other## s di## d when the## y accede## d to the Union . 
we are not striv## ing for perfect## ion here : non## e of the present Member State## s of the Union is perfect . 
problem## s have be## en mention## ed here today re## l## ating to Roman## ia &apos;## s home affair## s and issue## s of justice . 
Mr Bas## es## c## u , winner of the Roman## ian p## resident## ial elect## ions , promise## d the Roman## ians in hi## s victor## y speech an un## sul## li## ed administ## ration and an in## dependent civil service . 
this promise must be take## n serious## ly and must be fulfill## ed . 
we have to encourag## e Roman## ia to bring about reform## s . 
I wish to emphasis## e the import## ance of promot## ing human right## s in the futur## e . 
attention should not just be paid to the vi## ability of public administ## ration : human right## s issue## s are at least as import## ant , if not more s## o . 
traffick## ing in human be## ing## s is some## thing for which there must be zero tolerance , bo## th in Roman## ia and else## where in Europe . 
un## fortunate## ly , even the cred## ibility of the present Member State## s suffer## s on this issue . 
we can## not establish a margin of tolerance for traffick## ing in human be## ing## s : it ha## s to be complete## ly prohibit## ed . 
Roman## ia also need## s support in it## s implement## ation of the new law on child protection . 
final## ly , I wish to express my thank## s to Commission## er Re## hn , as he ha## s promise## d to keep Parliament ver## y well inform## ed . 
in my opinion , that is a ver## y import## ant point . 
Roman## ia should be read## y for member## ship , but the current Member State## s should also be read## y to accept Roman## ia as a member , and dia## logue between the Commission and Parliament can on## ly further that endeavour . 
- Mr President , the Roman## ian people have just vot## ed a different political party in## to power for the second time since the revolution . 
does this not prove that demo## cracy is work## ing in this country , which ha## s suffer## ed under bo## th dictator## ship and commun## ism ? 
that is why Roman## ia can## not be compar## ed to other countries , be## cause the after @## -## @ effect## s of this two## fold oppress## ion are s## till be## ing felt . 
it will take sever## al more generation## s be## fore the insane decision## s of a dictator and a secret police , the , cease to affect how people behave . 
our report does not mention the issue of the , which n## ever## the## less present## s a significant problem in term## s of human resource## s . 
in fact , Roman## ia ha## s not y## et emerge## d from this difficult period . 
Mr President , have we consider## ed that the young people who we## re born after the dictator## ship have not y## et reach## ed the age of major## ity ? 
where is this nation to find un## taint## ed , in## dependent staff , who have not be## en close to the dictator , who have not belong## ed to the communist or be## en part of the to fill post## s in these administ## rations and thu## s ensu## re that the## y are in## dependent , which is what we require ? 
the progress ma## de to## ward## s access## ion to the European Union should be consider## ed from two different view## point## s : the desir## e of the political class## es for change and the ability to achiev## e it in practice . 
the propos## al to delay Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion that ha## s be## en ma## de by the ver## y same people who we## re in favour of Tur## key this morning is some## thing with which I have difficult## y , and I actual## ly find it extreme## ly arrog## ant . 
it is on## ly 15 year## s since the revolution in Roman## ia , which could just as easi## ly have led to a civil war . 
we must there## fore hope that President Bas## es## c## u succeed## s in form## ing a coal## ition that ha## s the national interest at heart , ra## ther th## an the profile of the different political part## ies . 
al## though President Iliescu and President Con## stanti## nes## c## u , a one @## -## @ time member of this European People &apos;## s Part## y , have not manage## d to put in place all of the necess## ary reform## s , we must n## ever## the## less acknowledg## e that the## y have br## ought relativ## e institutional st## ability to the country . 
let us th## en , ra## ther th## an play## ing the school## master , have some respect for the ef## fort## s al## read## y ma## de and accurate## ly assess what remain## s to be done . 
Mr President , 20## 07 will in any case be a great year for Roman## ia be## cause in 20## 07 a Roman## ian city , Si## bi## u , will share the title of European Capital of Cult## ure with Luxembourg . 
this propos## al was ma## de by the Luxembourg Govern## ment , and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Minister## s and the Commission . 
the rich multi## cultural and multi## ethnic Roman## ian heritage will certain## ly enrich the culture of Europe , and Roman## ia should also be seen from the point of view of it## s cultural rich## es and the potent## ial of it## s population , which ha## s be## en bad## ly bru## ised by the mad## ness of a dictator and the dam## aging effect## s of a total## itarian ide## ology . 
Mr President , this morning I vot## ed in favour of start## ing negoti## ations with Tur## key . 
I am also in favour of Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion , and will seek to ensu## re that we do all we can to make this a re## ality . 
I believ## e that our rapporteur ha## s drawn the right conclusion## s in hi## s report , and I am grat## e## ful to him . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I thank Mr Mos## co## vici for hi## s excel## lent report . 
with the access## ion of Roman## ia and Bulgaria , the fifth round of enlarge## ment will have be## en implement## ed , creat## ing a large## r , democratic Europe , which will take it## s place on the world political s## tage as a place of great promise and pro## found concern## s , distinguish## ed by be## ing the Europe of citizen## ship . 
Europe is thu## s not just a free @## -## @ market and free trade area with a s## ing## le curr## ency , but above all it ha## s the ability and desir## e to peace## fully export the model consist## ing of the rule of law , protection of minor## ities and human right## s , sustain## able development , as well as an econom## y and finance## s that are efficient and design## ed to promot## e cohes## ion . 
that is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitution## al Treat## y and the N## ice Char## ter affirm . 
we there## fore welcome the success## es and stead## y improve## ment that Roman## ia ha## s achiev## ed in meet## ing the C## open## hagen crite## ria in the vari## ous field## s , as Mr Mos## co## vici ha## s indic## ated , emphasis## ing , , it## s respect for it## s minor## ities , bo## th Hung## arian and Roma . 
Roman## ia must , how## ever , make rapid progress to ful## fil all the access## ion commit## ments , e## special## ly in the area of the Comm## un## ity . 
structural measure## s are not en## ough to combat p## over## ty . 
corrupt## ion also need## s to be f## ought through prevent## ive measure## s and all law## s need to be enforce## d . 
last## ly , we feel that the improve## ment of legisl## ation on child protection and international adopt## ions is a posit## ive step . 
regard## ing the latter area , I would call on the Roman## ian author## ities to find an im## mediate solution to the problem of adopt## ions hit by delay## s , which are depriv## ing child## ren of the fami## lies to which the## y are entitle## d . 
in the name of that universal right , which is one of the strong point## s of the Constitution## al Treat## y , and in add## ition to the creation of an international commission to start work straight away , I call on the new## ly @## -## @ elect## ed Roman## ian author## ities not to waste pre## cious time and , for Christ## mas , to give th## ose child## ren the parent## s that al## read## y love them and with whom the## y can build a better futur## e in a peace## ful Europe . 
. 
Mr President , I will be brief . 
I have heard man## y posit## ive remark## s , most of which I agree with . 
of course , there we## re also man## y concern## s express## ed , man## y of which I also agree with . 
there we## re some critical remark## s , with which I do not agree , from Mr Ferber , Mr Lage## ndijk and other## s , that Roman## ia is not read## y to close the negoti## ations . 
I emphasis## e that we , as a preside## ncy and as a Council , base our position on the assess## ment of the European Commission . 
Roman## ia is not read## y for access## ion , which is why we feel it is import## ant to have two more year## s to achiev## e the whole frame## work for the negoti## ations , as we discuss## ed be## fore , with extra guarantee## s and extra safeguard## s . 
in respons## e to Mr Lage## ndijk &apos;## s remark## s , we do not need un## anim## ity in the Council for us## ing this extra safeguard clause - the possibil## ity of post## pon## ing the access## ion for a maxim## um of a year . 
no , precise## ly in the area of justice and home affair## s which he mention## s - as man## y member## s di## d - and also in the sensitiv## e area of competit## ion , we on## ly need a qualified major## ity for us## ing the extra safeguard clause . 
the rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici , Mr Meijer and other## s ma## de some remark## s about signal## s from Roman## ia that the p## resident @## -## @ elect want## s to re## negotiate the result## s . 
the p## resident @## -## @ elect seem## s to have notice## d critical remark## s about the idea of reopen## ing some chap## ter## s . 
we learn## ed from Buch## a## rest that Mr Bas## es## c## u is emphasis## ing the ef## fort## s to be ma## de be## fore Janu## ary 20## 07 , which leave no room for reopen## ing the final result## s of the negoti## ations . 
in a short re## ply to Mr Ferber about the financial con## sequenc## es of access## ion , I repeat what I s## aid about Bulgaria . 
the financial con## sequenc## es are al## read## y arrange## d in the financial package for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 09 , ir## respect## ive of the new financial perspective . 
let me conclude with my compliment## s to Mr Mos## co## vici . 
hi## s report address## es all the import## ant area## s in a construct## ive and even @## -## @ hand## ed way . 
. 
Mr President , I wish to join the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ office of the Council in thank## ing Mr Mos## co## vici , and I would like to make one or two comment## s and re## ply to th## ose question## s that have be## en ra## ised in this debate . 
first## ly , Mr Taba## j## di s## aid he appreci## ated the Commission &apos;## s object## ivity and im## partial## ity . 
I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in futur## e this should be a gui## d## ing principle in all enlarge## ment policy . 
my view is that after last year &apos;## s major set## back we s## hall now be proceed## ing gradual## ly and stead## ily in term## s of the enlarge## ment of the European area of peace and demo## cracy . 
our negoti## ations with the candid## ate countries will be gradual , stead## y , care## ful and thorough . 
in this regard , I understand in general the view## s express## ed by Mr Ferber . 
it is a p## ity he di## d not have time to hear my re## ply . 
as Mr Ferber demand## ed honest## y of the EU , that is to say our## selves , I agree that we should assess the effect## s of all decision## s take## n on enlarge## ment and that we need to adhere to the crite## ria . 
it is for that ver## y reason that we have propos## ed a safeguard clause in the chap## ter## s re## l## ating to justice and home affair## s and competit## ion . 
this safeguard clause may be adopt## ed by qualified major## ity , which make## s it cred## ible , and it will encourag## e Roman## ia to work and striv## e to achiev## e result## s . 
sever## al speaker## s have also quit## e right## ly give## n attention to the challenge## s that lie a## head for Roman## ia , including im## prov## ing the environment and the status of minor## ities as well as promot## ing the fight again## st corrupt## ion and crime . 
these are area## s we continu## ally monitor and will return to in detail when the Mon## ito## ring Report come## s out next aut## um## n . 
it is th## en that we s## hall evalu## ate the progress that ha## s be## en ma## de over the month## s to come . 
Roman## ia &apos;## s new govern## ment will have a gold## en opportun## ity to demonst## rate that it can genuine## ly ful## fil it## s commit## ments and reform the country &apos;## s soci## ety and institution## s . 
Mr Davi## es and Mr## s J## ä## ä## t## teen## m## ä## k## i point## ed out that the current Member State## s also have much to do to develop the rule of law . 
one can on## ly agree with this . 
these issue## s , how## ever , do not fall with## in the compete## nce of the Commission## er for Enlarg## e## ment . ra## ther , it would be better to address these problem## s via the infringe## ment procedure or present a case us## ing the machine## ry of the European Court of Human Right## s . 
in conclusion , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Mos## co## vici . I agree with the view express## ed by bo## th him and Mr S## z## ent @## -## @ Iván## y that it is in the interest## s of bo## th the European Union and Roman## ia that Roman## ia is read## y by 20## 07 . 
this in the first in## stance depend## s on Roman## ia &apos;## s will## ing## ness and ability to reform the country and it## s soci## ety . 
the Commission , for it## s part , will give all the support it can to ensu## re that Roman## ia strength## ens it## s ef## fort## s s## o as to pre @## -## @ empt the use of the safeguard clause## s refer## red to just now . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will be at 11.## 30 a.m## . tomor## row . 
the next item is question## s to the Council ( B## 6 @## -## @ 01## 36 / 20## 04 ) . 
we s## hall consider a number of question## s . 
I should first like to clar## ify the follow## ing : accord## ing to our Rule## s of Procedure , when a Member who is schedul## ed to ask a question can## not be here , he or s## he must personal## ly re## quest a replace## ment to s## peak on hi## s or her be## half . 
accord## ing## ly , the Bur## eau can## not accept replace## ments by thir## d part## ies , s## uch as political group secret## aries @## -## @ general . 
the re## quest## s for replace## ment by the Member## s who ask## ed Qu## est## ions No## s 4 and 7 , Mr A## yl## ward and Mr R## yan , are there## fore not accept## ed , and if at the time of the question## s concern## ed th## ose Member## s are not here , the question## s will be deem## ed to have laps## ed . 
be## fore you answer the first question , Mr Nicolaï , I should in any case like to remind the House what Mr Vi## d## al @## -## @ Qu## ad## ra## s told us this morning - that this s## itt## ing must finish today at 6.## 30 p.m. , due to commit## ments that the Council &apos;## s represent## ative can## not postpone . 
man## y business## es from the new Member State## s which import a## lumin## ium from Russia and the CIS have appeal## ed to the## ir MEP## s for action be take## n to drop or reduce the 6 % du## ty , give## n that the economic situ## ation in this branch of Pol## ish indus## try ha## s deterior## ated significant## ly as a result , with high## er production cost## s and high## er product price## s , lead## ing to a fall in the competitive## ness of Pol## ish comp## an## ies in the harsh environment of the European market . 
the opt## ion of buy## ing du## ty @## -## @ free a## lumin## ium from countries which have appropriate agree## ments with the European Union is un## profit## able for small and medium @## -## @ s## ized comp## an## ies . 
will the Council take ur## gent action to protect Pol## ish business## es threaten## ed with closure ? 
the Council would refer the honour## able Member to the answer it ga## ve to question H @## -## @ 03## 99 / 04 , by R## y## s## zar## d Czarnecki , d## uring Que## s## tion Time on 17 N## ov## ember 20## 04 , in which it suggest## ed that the honour## able Member should put hi## s question to the Commission . 
- Mr President , Mr Nicolaï , I should like to inform you that I put my question to the European Commission , but regret## tably I di## d not receiv## e a satisfactory answer . 
with your permiss## ion , I should like to make known my dis## satisf## action at the alarm## ing muddle that exist## s with regard to this issue , as well as the bureaucrat## ic hurdle## s , which may well be intention## al . 
it is no e## asy task to ident## ify exact## ly which body is competent to take decision## s regard## ing a## lumin## ium import## s from Russia and the countries belong## ing to the Common## wealth of In## dependent State## s . 
Po## land ha## s repeat## ed## ly appli## ed to the European Commission for these custom## s du## ties to be reduce## d , y## et un## fortunate## ly it## s application## s have be## en reject## ed with## out adduc## ing any clear or material reason## s . 
this is why , Mr Nicolaï , I am appeal## ing to you and ask## ing you to take action on this issue , s## o as to help bo## th Pol## ish entrepreneur## s and entrepreneur## s from other countries . 
. this issue , I repeat , is re## ally the exclus## ive compete## nce of the Commission , s## o I can## not answer the question . 
on 29 October 20## 04 , the P## y## re## née## s @## -## @ Medi## terranean Euro## region was establish## ed , com## prising Catalonia , Ar## agon , the Bal## ear## ic Island## s , Mid## i @## -## @ P## y## re## née## s and Lang## ue## doc @## -## @ Rou## ssillon , as an area of inter @## -## @ regional co## operation on rail## way infra## structure , aero## n## aut## ic## s , logist## ic## s , innov## ation and research , and with the stated intention of open## ing it## s door## s to new region## s . 
the Euro## region does not have , nor will it have , any political content what## ever , since this is alien to the ver## y con## cept of the new legal ent## ity creat## ed , who## s## e ef## fort## s are direct## ed to## ward## s the kind of co## operation describ## ed above . 
what role will the European Union acknowledg## e this Euro## region as having , and more specific## ally , what involve## ment will the EU give it in join## ing up Comm## un## ity poli## cies ? what manage## ment and monitor## ing power## s will the EU grant it with regard to Comm## un## ity fund## ing al## read## y grant## ed and to be grant## ed to the regional promot## ion and development of the P## y## re## née## s @## -## @ Medi## terranean Euro## region ? 
. the Council recall## s that Council Regul## ation ( EC ) No 12## 60 / 19## 99 , lay## ing down general provision## s on the structural fund## s , set## s out the Comm## un## ity initiative## s as one of the instrument## s of regional policy with## in the frame## work of the structural fund## s . 
in the current program## ming period of 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 06 there are four Comm## un## ity initiative## s . 
one of them is Inter## re## g . 
this cover## s cross @## -## @ border trans## national and inter## regional co## operation intend## ed to encourag## e a harmon## ious , balance## d and sustain## able development of the whole of the Comm## un## ity area . 
Inter## re## g III ha## s three section## s deal## ing respect## ive## ly with cross @## -## @ border co## operation : the promot## ion of integrate## d regional development between border## ing region## s ; cross @## -## @ national co## operation , contribut## ing to an integrate## d and harmon## ious ter## rit## ory a## cross the European Union ; and inter## regional co## operation to improve the poli## cies and technique## s of inter## regional economic development . 
there## fore , the Pyrenees / Medi## terranean Euro## region could benefit from the support of this Comm## un## ity initiative , subject to the procedure## s establish## ed by the Commission . 
the Council also recall## s that the Commission ha## s propos## ed the creation of an instrument call## ed &apos; European group## ing## s of cross @## -## @ border co## operation &apos; . 
this would be give## n a legal personal## ity to over## come the obstacle## s hinder## ing cross @## -## @ border co## operation . 
this propos## al is current## ly be## ing examin## ed by the prepar## atory bodies with## in the Council and also ha## s to be consider## ed by the European Parliament with## in the frame## work of the co## decision procedure . 
I would like to point out that there are more th## an a hundred Euro## region## s in Europe and that , in fact , through the im## petus of INTER## REG , the Comm## un## ity initiative which is right now going also to become an object## ive , the## y are of particular interest . 
I would like to ask the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council whet## her he believ## es that Euro## region## s s## uch as the Pyrenees @## -## @ Medi## terranean are fundamental , bo## th in term## s of promot## ing the dis## appearance of the border## s which represent bar## rier## s to economic and social development , and in term## s of giving sub## stance to the principle of territorial cohes## ion , which is now enshrine## d in the European Constitution , which ha## s be## en sign## ed by the 25 represent## ative## s of the Govern## ments of the Member State## s , and which there## fore deserve## s every possible support from the Union ? 
Mr President , we have , on occasion## s , receiv## ed complain## ts from the European region## s that it is the Govern## ments of the State## s that distribut## e the Cohesion Fund## s and also the regional element of the Struct## ural Fund## s , and on occasion## s th## ose region## s of the same political colour as the Govern## ment of the State receiv## e favour## able treat## ment . 
Mr Bar## nier , th## en Commission## er respons## ible for Region## al Poli## cy , announce## d to us an instrument which the region## s could access direct## ly with## out having to go through the Govern## ments of the State## s . 
I do not know whet## her the initiative on European cross @## -## @ border co## operation group## ing## s , which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament , is the instrument Mr Bar## nier was refer## ring to . 
would the Council agree that the region## s should have the possibil## ity of access## ing the fund## s direct## ly with## out having to go through the Govern## ments of the State## s ? 
. I tri## ed to be comprehens## ive in my initial remark## s , but I will add that Member State## s and regional and local author## ities have experience## d major difficult## ies in carry## ing out man## aging action## s of cross @## -## @ border co## operation , trans## national co## operation and inter## regional co## operation with## in the frame## work of differ## ing national law## s and procedure## s . 
that call## s for appropriate measure## s at EU / Comm## un## ity level in order to reduce the difficult## ies . 
harmon## ious development of the entire Comm## un## ity ter## rit## ory and reinforce## d economic , social and territorial cohes## ion imp## ly enhance## d cross @## -## @ border co## operation and the adopt## ion of measure## s to improve the implement## ation conditio## ns for cross @## -## @ border co## operation . 
. in re## ply to the honour## able Member the Council stress## es that it ha## s not alter## ed it## s position follow## ing the US decision to recognis## e the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under it## s constitutional name . 
at the first meet## ing of the Stab## il## isation and Associ## ation Council between the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of Sept## ember 20## 04 , the Council not## ed that the differ## ence## s over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia persist## ed and encourag## ed the search for a mutual## ly accept## able solution , with## in the frame## work of Unit## ed Nation## s Security Council Re## solution## s 8## 17 / 93 and 84## 5 / 93 , by Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . 
in## de## ed , in a joint press statement of the EU @## -## @ Western Balkan## s For## um of N## ov## ember 20## 04 , the foreign minister## s of bo## th the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recall## ed the need for all particip## ants to agree on find## ing mutual## ly accept## able solution## s and con## clud## ing agree## ments on out## standing issue## s with neighbour## ing countries . 
- Minister , allow me to respond with a supplement## ary question : does the Council consider that this long @## -## @ out## standing issue of the name might creat## e problem## s in the desir## able further of this country to## ward## s the European institution## s ? 
what further action does the Council intend to take in order to persuade the govern## ment of the F## Y## ROM to maintain d## uring talk## s in New York a more construct## ive stand in the negoti## ations to find a mutual## ly accept## able solution ? 
. that is more or less an## other question and I have nothing to add to what I have just s## aid . 
as the author is not present , Que## s## tion No 4 laps## es . 
could the Council indic## ate what ef## fort## s the European Union will make in the coming month## s to lobby the American Administ## ration s## o that it com## plies fully with the political oblig## ations of the Kyoto Protocol ? 
can the Council indic## ate clear## ly what international ef## fort## s will be under## take## n by the European Union to ensu## re that all countries in the world comp## ly with the clear and un## equi## vocal commit## ments of the Kyoto Protocol ? 
if the European Union is to become more competitive , access to new technologies must be avail## able to all communit## ies in Europe . 
the European Union is commit## ted to implement## ing what is call## ed the ID## ABC Pro## gramme , which is design## ed to promot## e the use of the Inter## net in public and govern## ment service## s . 
this is part of the pan @## -## @ European e## Govern## ment Service## s I## nitiative . 
can the European Council indic## ate what progress ha## s be## en ma## de in implement## ing this programme , which is s## uch a central component to im## prov## ing the avail## ability of inform## ation technologies in Europe ? 
the Council would like to inform the honour## able Member that the implement## ation of the ID## ABC Pro## gramme fall## s with## in the remit of the Commission , which is assist## ed in this by the pan @## -## @ European e## Govern## ment Service## s Committee . 
the Council would also like to remind the honour## able Member that the ID## ABC Pro## gramme decision will on## ly enter in## to force on 1 Janu## ary 20## 05 and thu## s the implement## ation of the programme as s## uch ha## s not y## et start## ed . 
the Council invit## es the honour## able Member to refer this matter to the Commission for more detail## s regard## ing the prepar## ation of the programme . 
the Council is aware of two stu## dies launch## ed by the Commission under the ID## A Pro## gramme . 
one stu## dy aim## s to establish the need## s and benefit## s to business## es and citizen## s of pan @## -## @ European e## Govern## ment Service## s in order to reinforce a proper## ly orient## ed approach to the deliver## y of a pan @## -## @ European service . 
the second one aim## s to ident## ify futur## e infra## structure service## s need## ed to support the pan @## -## @ European e## Govern## ment Service## s . 
like## wise , in the prepar## ation of the ID## ABC Pro## gramme , the Council also acknowledg## es the organisation of by Commission of a conference due to take place in Bru## ssels on 17 and 18 Fe## bru## ary 20## 05 , which will focus on the require## ments for pan @## -## @ European e## Govern## ment Service## s for citizen## s and business## es and on the factor## s need## ed to implement them . 
I thank the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office for hi## s respons## e . 
the reason I put the question to him was be## cause when this was origin## ally discuss## ed as a programme , it came from the Council , and the N## ether## land## s Govern## ment was one of the govern## ments , together with the Irish Govern## ment , the Luxembourg Govern## ment and the Italia## n Govern## ment , which we## re put## ting it forward as a propos## al that should be push## ed at Commission level . 
follow## ing on from what you have s## aid and what you know that the Commission is under## taking , are there any particular initiative## s that the preside## ncy want## s to see car## ried forward from it## s preside## ncy to the Luxembourg preside## ncy to ensu## re that the role of this programme is fully implement## ed ? 
. apart from these major action## s , the ID## A Unit is prepar## ing to launch the programme fully d## uring the first half of 20## 05 . 
to that end , anticip## ated activities are be## ing analyse## d and form## at## s for work programme ent## ries , project implement## ation plan## s , etc## . are be## ing develop## ed . 
can the European Council indic## ate what measure## s have be## en take## n to improve mari## time safety and securit## y in Europe since the Erik## a disaster , and can it clear## ly indic## ate what measure## s it is seek## ing to implement s## o as to improve mari## time safety and securit## y in the next few year## s ? 
. as the Council ha## s repeat## ed## ly s## aid , safety and securit## y lie at the heart of the European Union mari## time policy . 
measure## s to improve them , as well as to protect the marine environment , represent the bulk of legisl## ation adopt## ed in this area in the f## ive year## s since the disaster . 
in it## s respons## e to this and other similar incident## s , the Council ha## s consist## ent## ly support## ed a dual approach : on the one hand , in## corpo## rating the provision## s of international convention## s in## to Comm## un## ity law and thu## s ens## uring strict## er compliance with the high## est global standard## s and , on the other hand , adopt## ing specific Comm## un## ity provision## s where## ver IM## O standard## s are lack## ing or in## sufficient . 
in this way a comprehens## ive body of mari## time safety legisl## ation ha## s be## en built up and is continu## ing to expand . 
a## mong## st the specific measure## s adopt## ed in the inter## mediate after## math of the disaster , we## re first## ly th## ose under the Erik## a I package aim## ed at enhance## d port state control to combat sub## standard ship## ping ; strict## er monitor## ing of the class## ification comp## an## ies use to conduct safety check## s on ships ; and the accele## rated phas## ing @## -## @ out of s## ing## le @## -## @ hull oil tank## ers . 
second## ly , there we## re th## ose under the Erik## a II package aim## ed at the establish## ment of a Comm## un## ity vessel traffic monitor## ing and inform## ation system and the creation of a European Mar## i## time Safety Ag## ency who## s## e main role is to monitor the effective## ness of the EU mari## time safety rule## s in general . 
other measure## s include th## ose design## ed to improve the safety of ships other th## an oil tank## ers , s## uch as pass## enger vessel## s , to ensu## re a mini## mum level of seafarer## s &apos; train## ing and to reduce poll## ution from ships . 
for im## prov## ing securit## y in the wake of a number of terrorist outrage## s , a regulation on en## h## ancing ship and port facilit## ies securit## y was adopt## ed ear## lier this year , in## corpo## rating the SO## LA## S ISP## S measure## s in## to EU legisl## ation and expand## ing them to include domestic traffic . 
current## ly under consider## ation by the Council are measure## s to implement the IM## O Inter## national Safety Man## age## ment Co## de with## in the Comm## un## ity , s## o penal## ties can be impose## d for certain poll## ution off## ence## s and port securit## y enhance## d . 
final## ly , look## ing a## head , a new package of mari## time safety measure## s is expect## ed to be submit## ted for examin## ation by the Council in spring 20## 05 . 
I would like to thank the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office for hi## s re## ply . 
could he give assurance## s there## fore that in the futur## e , depend## ing on the financial perspective## s , there will be provision for mari## time safety measure## s from the Union in the coming year## s ? 
- Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , the propos## al for a direct## ive to impose sanction## s for marine poll## ution remain## ed pend## ing d## uring the Dutch Presidency be## cause certain countries express## ed disagree## ment , including Greece . 
I am aware of the fact that Greece propos## ed certain amend## ments in order to accept this direct## ive . 
can the Council describ## e to us the content of these amend## ments which we## re table## d by the Greek Govern## ment ? 
. the last question was a more or less new question . 
this first question is also on an## other issue . 
we will be having man## y discuss## ions on the financial perspective## s and this is one of the man## y issue## s we will discuss . 
as you know , the Council ha## s not decide## d any## thing on the new financial perspective## s . 
we have on## ly take## n an over## view of the s## o @## -## @ call## ed build## ing block## s and these build## ing block## s reflect the different position## s of the Member State## s to the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s .

can the Council indic## ate what fund## s have be## en disburse## d by the European Union with a view to halt## ing the cultiva## tion of drug## s in Afghan## istan for the year 20## 04 and what fund## s the European Council envi## s## age## s that it will disburse in this specific policy area over the next two year## s ? 
follow## ing the adopt## ion by the Council of the Regul## ation on Administ## rative and Lega## l Co## operation for Consumer Protect## ion , does the Council have any plan## s to co## ordinate progress on Member State co## operation on stamp## ing out cross @## -## @ border fraud and rogue trad## ers oper## ating dis## honest prize draw## s , mislead## ing market## ing and similar cross @## -## @ border crime ? 
. Mr President , the adopt## ion of the regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on co## operation between national author## ities respons## ible for the enforce## ment of consum## er protection law## s - the s## o @## -## @ call## ed Regul## ation on Consumer Protect## ion Co## operation - does not , as s## uch , have any bear## ing on law enforce## ment co## operation between Member State## s . 
Member State## s &apos; police and judicial author## ities are al## read## y active## ly co## oper## ating in the fight again## st all type## s of crime . 
the Council ha## s adopt## ed vari## ous instrument## s on cross @## -## @ border co## operation in the fight again## st crime , not## ably in the con## text of mutual recogn## ition and enforce## ment . 
these instrument## s , in principle , have a general s## cope and are not limit## ed to specific type## s of crime . 
that answer illust## rates why I ask## ed the question . 
this kind of crime affect## s citizen## s from a## cross the European Union ; it is an accele## rating form of crime . 
Member## s in this House will know of people who have be## en scam## med , ver## y often vulner## able European citizen## s - the elder## ly , for in## stance . 
will the preside## ncy recognis## e that there are certain form## s of crime which are natural## ly cross @## -## @ border issue## s ? 
for ex## ample , I represent London , where much of this crime take## s place , but people are be## ing scam## med a## cross the EU . 
I should like to ask the Council to take serious## ly a form of crime that is not be## ing deal## t with a## cross border## s . 
there is too li## ttle co## operation between Member State## s on this kind of grow## ing crime and we know that our European citizen## s expect us , as parliament## arian## s , to question you on how effective you can be in solv## ing this kind of cross @## -## @ border issue . 
I want to reinforce the point## s just ma## de by my colleague . 
as an MEP I receiv## e man## y letter## s from concern## ed constitue## nts who have be## en de## fraud## ed by people oper## ating in other Member State## s of the European Union , particular## ly through fraud through fax machine## s , s## end## ing false contra## cts and false## ly an## nounc## ing prize @## -## @ draw winner## s . 
a lot of these are bas## ed in Luxembourg , which will hold the next preside## ncy of the EU . 
frank## ly it bring## s the EU in## to dis## repute when we are told that there is nothing that can be done about this situ## ation . 
if citizen## s are to gain any advantage from EU co## operation , it should be precise## ly in tack## ling these sort## s of problem## s . 
. we understand the problem and I take note of your remark## s . 
un## fortunate## ly I have nothing to add to what I s## aid be## fore . 
in Dar## fur , hundred## s of people are dy## ing e## ach day from hung## er , dis## ease and continu## ed viol## ence , which show## s no sign## s of ab## ating . 
70 000 people have al## read## y lo## st the## ir live## s and hundred## s of thousand## s of live## s are s## till at risk . 
innoc## ent civil## ians continu## e to be attack## ed and the number of displace## d people is grow## ing as people flee the viol## ence . 
the civil## ians live in const## ant fear of attack and re## ly on human## itarian assist## ance for food , water and mean## s of surviv## al . 
the on## going viol## ence and in## securit## y is serious## ly hamper## ing the human## itarian ef## fort , prevent## ing access to man## y area## s , thu## s augment## ing the suffer## ing and further risk## ing the live## s of these innoc## ent people . 
in light of the serious## ness of this situ## ation , what is be## ing done by the Council to ensu## re that this cris## is is plac## ed and remain## s high on the age## nda of the EU ? 
what is the Council do## ing to ensu## re that the Sudan## ese Govern## ment is heed## ing international law and the agree## ments sign## ed with UN age## ncies ? 
. from it## s out## set , at the begin## ning of the year , the Dar## fur cris## is ha## s be## en one of the absolut## e priorit## ies on the EU age## nda . 
through## out the year the European Union ha## s be## en at the fore## front of international ef## fort## s to contain and resolv## e the conflict in Dar## fur , to stop the mass## ive human right## s viol## ations taking place there and to prevent an al## read## y ver## y serious human## itarian situ## ation from deterior## ating further . 
Member State## s and the Comm## un## ity have contribut## ed to the human## itarian relief ef## fort## s with more th## an EUR 3## 25 million . 
the Union ha## s also strong## ly support## ed the Africa## n Union &apos;## s lead## ing role in address## ing the cris## is . 
the EU ha## s thu## s play## ed a key role in support of an A## U @## -## @ led cease## fire monitor## ing mission and is now active## ly support## ing the deploy## ment of the expand## ed mission . 
al## most 60 per cent of the total cost of the expand## ed A## U mission is financ## ed by a contribut## ion of some EUR 80 million from the peace facilit## y , and sever## al Member State## s are provid## ing additional financial and logist## ical support for the mission as well as plan## ner## s and milit## ary observ## ers . 
the Council ha## s repeat## ed## ly , most re## cent## ly on the occasion of it## s meet## ing on 22 N## ov## ember , confirm## ed it## s read## iness to continu## e to provid## e support for the deploy## ment of the mission in term## s of financ## ing , logist## ic## s and material , as well as person## nel if re## quest## ed . 
the Council consider## s that the deploy## ment of the expand## ed A## U mission in Dar## fur , together with the EU @## -## @ led negoti## ations between the part## ies to find a political solution for Dar## fur , offer## s an opportun## ity for a comprehens## ive solution to the Dar## fur conflict . 
in parallel to these ef## fort## s , the EU ha## s contribut## ed to the pressure from the international communit## y on all part## ies to guarantee free and un## conditional access for human## itarian aid and to ensu## re the securit## y of the civil## ian population . 
the Council is close## ly monitor## ing compliance by all part## ies with the demand## s express## ed by the EU and the rest of the international communit## y and the commit## ments it ha## s under## take## n with the UN . 
to this end , the EU collabo## rates close## ly with the UN Secret## ary @## -## @ General &apos;## s Spec## ial Representative for the Sudan and active## ly take## s part in the work of the Jo## int Implement## ation Mechan## ism that evalu## ate## s the implement## ation of the joint comm## uniqué which consist## s of the commit## ments of bo## th the Sudan## ese Govern## ment and the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
in line with Re## solution## s 15## 56 and 15## 64 of the UN Security Council , the Council ha## s also on sever## al occasion## s reiterate## d it## s will## ing## ness to take appropriate measure## s , including sanction## s , if no progress is achiev## ed on the commit## ments ma## de by the Sudan## ese Govern## ment . 
Mr President , I thank you for your out## line of the situ## ation in the Sudan . 
just today we have had news from the relief age## ncies oper## ating out of Ireland that the situ## ation is wor## s## e , not better . 
I should like to ask you to indic## ate when we might actual## ly implement sanction## s , as oppose## d to just threaten## ing them . 
over half a million people are now in di## re circum## stance## s in the Sudan . 
it may have gone from the head## line## s , but the problem is s## till there . 
. I agree . 
as you may know , last Mon## day the Council also discuss## ed the situ## ation in Sudan and we are serious## ly concern## ed about the deterior## ation of the securit## y and human## itarian situ## ation in Dar## fur . 
the Council there## fore call## ed on all part## ies to abide in full by the## ir commit## ments . 
we also encourag## ed them to conclude the negoti## ations between the Govern## ment of Sudan and the S## PL## M## A be## fore the end of the year . 
the Council will continu## e to monitor the situ## ation in Dar## fur and will consider taking appropriate measure## s , which could include sanction## s in accord## ance with UN Security Council Re## solution## s 15## 56 and 15## 65 if no tang## ible progress is achiev## ed in this respect . 
hence the situ## ation is and remain## s high on the age## nda of the European Union . 
a tragi## c e## vent re## cent## ly took place in Swede## n when a truck @## -## @ d## river who had just left the fer## ry in T## rell## e## borg sever## e## ly under the influence of alcohol drove again## st the flow of traffic and f## ive people in two on## coming vehicle## s we## re kill## ed . 
different approach## es to alcohol and different blood @## -## @ alcohol level limit## s in different European countries make it more difficult to deal with drink @## -## @ driv## ers and to prosecu## te them , e## special## ly in the case of cross @## -## @ border traffic . 
in 20## 01 , on a propos## al from the Commission , the Council decide## d to re## commend that all Member State## s introduce a maxim## um blood @## -## @ alcohol level of 0.## 2 pro## mill## e for professional driv## ers . 
the re## commend## ation was adopt## ed in## stead of a direct## ive on a common upper limit for driv## ers . 
which countries have introduce## d that upper limit to d## ate ? 
is the Council of Minister## s re @## -## @ evalu## ating it## s re## commend## ation and what is the out## come of the follow @## -## @ up at Comm## un## ity level provid## ed for in that re## commend## ation ? 
up until now , the Council ha## s not be## en inform## ed of the out## come of s## uch an evalu## ation . 
that be## ing s## o , the Council under## line## s that these conclusion## s do not call specific## ally for the introdu## ction of a maxim## um permit## ted blood @## -## @ alcohol content of 0.## 2 mg for professional driv## ers . 
further## more , the Council would like to inform the honour## able Member that it does not have any inform## ation on how man## y Member State## s have introduce## d the a## fore## mention## ed B## AC level## s s## o far . 
how## ever , the Council would like to draw the honour## able Member &apos;## s attention to the Commission re## commend## ation of 6 April 20## 04 on enforce## ment in the field of road safety , which , in Re## commend## ation 6 , call## s for an intens## ified application of random breath test## ing with an alcohol screen## ing de## vice as a lead## ing principle for sur## veil## lance of drink driv## ing . 
the Council want## s to ensu## re the honour## able Member of it## s strong and on## going commit## ment to im## prov## ing road safety and to tack## ling all potent## ial source## s of road accident fatal## ities . 
in this con## text it refer## s to the Council conclusion## s on road safety from Ju## ne and Dec## ember last year , bo## th of which explic## it## ly refer to strict## er enforce## ment , in particular seat## belt use , speed## ing and drink driv## ing . 
in the light of this on## going commit## ment the Council had an exchange of view## s d## uring it## s meet## ing on 9 and 10 Dec## ember 20## 04 and adopt## ed the Council conclusion## s on road safety , in which it agree## d on the need to focus road safety poli## cies in four import## ant area## s , name## ly enforce## ment and best practice## s , vehicle safety , im## prov## ing safety on European road## s and fund## ing road safety . 
in this con## text the Council under## line## d that , with regard to road safety enforce## ment , priorit## y should be give## n , not## ably , to d## river behaviour that cause## s high accident risk## s or could have sever## e con## sequenc## es s## uch as driv## ing under the influence of alcohol . 
Mr President , I wish to thank the Council for it## s answer , but I am clear## ly un## happy to hear that the issue is fall## ing in## to a black hole between the Commission and the Council . 
there is every opportun## ity in this case for the Council to take the initiative . 
we know that approximate## ly 10## .000 people di## e on the road## s e## ach year be## cause of driv## ing under the influence of alcohol . 
we also know that commercial driv## ing is an import## ant area when it come## s to get## ting to grip## s with drink @## -## @ driv## ing . 
that is why this re## commend## ation is import## ant , and I see no reason## s why the Member State## s should not take these initiative## s . 
the conclusion## s also include a paragraph about follow @## -## @ up , which would permit further discuss## ions about en## ab## ling alcohol screen## ing de## vice## s to be introduce## d in## to car## s . 
this is a technical invent## ion with which indus## try too work## s . 
I should like to hear whet## her discuss## ions are be## ing conduct## ed in the Council about the possibil## ity of introdu## c## ing alcohol screen## ing de## vice## s in## to vehicle## s . 
. I am s## or## ry my answer di## d not satisf## y the honour## able Member . 
I thought I had explain## ed the man## y action## s and thing## s we , as a Council , have done to show our commit## ment to this issue . 
we have to put our formal position in## to effect , as well as the formal position of the Council to## ward## s individual Member State## s . 
as I tri## ed to explain be## fore , the matter is now in the hand## s of the Commission and we await it## s evalu## ation and propos## al## s . 
the EU &apos;## s aspi## ration to transform it## self in## to the most competitive econom## y in the world ( Lisbon Ag## enda ) call## s for a significant increas## e in fund## ing for European research policy . 
research spend## ing is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitut## es invest## ment in it## s surviv## al in a fierce## ly competitive international environment . 
how## ever , the declare## d intention of develop## ing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcil## e with the restrict## ions impose## d by the St## ability and Develop## ment Pact ( S## DP ) , which prohibit## s Member State## s &apos; public expend## iture from over## shoot## ing a budget de## ficit of 3 % of G## DP . 
if the Member State## s are to have an incentiv## e to set a## side 1 % of G## DP for public fund## ing of research policy , that per## cent## age should not be include## d in calcul## ating the ceil## ing of 3 % of G## DP laid down by the S## DP . 
does the Council agree that public spend## ing on research constitut## es top priorit## y strategic expend## iture for the EU and , as s## uch , can justifiably be exclude## d from the crite## ria under the Pact ? 
the argument that s## uch a decision will pave the way for a host of other except## ions ( e.g. milit## ary spend## ing ) is not ten## able since the strength## ening of research is an establish## ed European strategic go## al which ha## s no ana## logy with any other national or European object## ive## s 
. the Council note## s that increas## ing over## all expend## iture on research is in## de## ed a central element in the Lisbon strate## gy and one of the key## s to making the EU more competitive in the global econom## y . 
the Council and Member State## s have repeat## ed## ly commit## ted them## selves to achiev## ing average research and development expend## iture of 3 % of G## DP by 20## 10 . 
the re## cent Kok report o## nce again high## light## ed the need to make good the under @## -## @ perform## ance in relation to this target . 
not## with## standing this general statement , the Council does not share the honour## able Member &apos;## s view that it is the St## ability and G## row## th Pact which is prevent## ing Member State## s from achiev## ing the Lisbon object## ive . 
per## hap## s more fundamental## ly , the St## ability and G## row## th Pact should be us## ed as a tool to encourag## e national expend## iture on individual budget component## s over and above other## s . 
first## ly , it is clear## ly possible to fund research while respect## ing the Pact . 
this is a ver## y import## ant point that lead## s on to the second point that the Pact is not the factor limit## ing invest## ment in research . 
research fund## ing is ra## ther a matter of national priorit## ies . 
t## hirdly , I would note that the level of R &#91; amp &#93; D expend## iture is not s## ole## ly dependent on public finance . 
the target cover## s privat## e## ly @## -## @ fund## ed R &#91; amp &#93; D as well , which can be encourag## ed by a number of mean## s in add## ition to public expend## iture . 
the key to reach## ing the 3 % target is the two thir## d## s of R &#91; amp &#93; D spend## ing that should be privat## e## ly fund## ed , not the one thir## d that should come from public fund## s . 
final## ly , I would like to recall that the Pact is a frame## work for the manage## ment of budget## ary poli## cies at global level , with a view to ens## uring the sustain## ability of public finance## s over the long## er term . 
all expend## iture ha## s to be paid for , even if in the long## er run we would hope that invest## ment would have posit## ive return## s . 
when the Eco## fin Council discuss## ed the Pact on 16 N## ov## ember 20## 04 and this precise issue was ra## ised , there was a broad major## ity of Member State## s again## st pur## s## ing the possibil## ity suggest## ed by the Member and ex## clud## ing certain categor## ies of expend## iture from de## ficit calcul## ations . 
in the analytical assess## ment of the reason## s for an excess## ive de## ficit , the Council will al## ways take in## to account the type of expend## iture and the like## ly long @## -## @ term impact . 
but the Council does not share the honour## able Member &apos;## s assess## ment regard## ing the exclus## ion of R &#91; amp &#93; D expend## iture from de## ficit calcul## ations . 
- Mr President , I might have agree## d with every## thing Mr Nicolaï s## aid if I di## d not believ## e that we can## not achiev## e the Lisbon object## ive## s un## less research make## s a great deal of progress . 
thu## s , if the re## ply concern## ed any other subject , I would agree with you . 
how## ever , I regret that I must disagree be## cause research is the corner## stone of Lisbon . 
. on## ly two EU Member State## s have al## read## y reach## ed the Lisbon go## al of 3 % of G## DP spent on R &#91; amp &#93; D - Fin## land and Swede## n . 
the## y have achiev## ed this by running budget## ary surplus## es . 
it is clear## ly possible to fund research while respect## ing the Pact . 
that is an import## ant point . 
second , even Germa## ny and France with the## ir well @## -## @ known budget## ary problem## s have al## read## y achiev## ed rates of 2.5 % and 2.2 % respect## ive## ly . 
again , it appear## s that the Pact is not the factor limit## ing invest## ment in research . 
it would appear to be a matter of national priorit## ies . 
that bring## s us to the end of Que## s## tion Time . 
we are also coming the end of the Dutch Presidency . 
I believ## e that this is the last time that you will be with us for question## s to the Council , Mr Ni## ko## l## aï , and I should like to offer you my best wish## es and thank## s for your work with Parliament d## uring your Presidency . 
I wish you every success at the end of this period , particular## ly d## uring the next few days , which , I have no doubt , will be extreme## ly demand## ing . 
question## s No## s 12 to 31 will be answer## ed in writing . 
first## ly , I must inform you that , follow## ing the invit## ations for the present## ation of the candid## ature## s for the post of European Ombuds## man , the dead## line for which was 30 Sept## ember of this year , four candid## ature## s have be## en present## ed , of which two will be put forward , name## ly , th## ose of Mr Nikiforos Diam## and## our## os and Mr Giuseppe Fort## un## ato . 
the candid## ate## s appear## ed be## fore the competent committee on 29 N## ov## ember and the elect## ion will take place on 11 Janu## ary next year , accord## ing to the procedure laid down in our Rule## s of Procedure . 
the next item is the debate on the report by Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott on the propos## al for a Council regulation amend## ing Regul## ation ( EC ) No 97## 6 / 19## 99 lay## ing down the require## ments for the implement## ation of Comm## un## ity operation## s , other th## an th## ose of development co## operation , which , with## in the frame## work of Comm## un## ity co## operation policy , contribut## e to the general object## ive of develop## ing and con## solid## ating demo## cracy and the rule of law and to that of respect## ing human right## s and fundamental free## dom## s in thir## d countries . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , at my hear## ing be## fore the European Parliament some week## s ago , I s## poke out in favour of develop## ing the close## st possible work## ing relation## s between the Commission and the European Parliament on human right## s and democrat## isation . 
I would like to renew this voluntary commit## ment whole## hearted## ly today . 
the European Parliament is an extreme## ly import## ant partner for the Commission in this area of work , and s## o I am keen to follow in the foot## step## s of my predecessor , Mr Pat## ten , in pursu## ing a comprehens## ive and regular dia## logue with you on share## d issue## s and concern## s . 
the purpose of today &apos;## s decision is to safeguard the legal bas## is for the continu## ed exist## ence of the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s beyond the end of the year . 
this necessitate## s what I hope will be Parliament &apos;## s posit## ive vot## e on the Commission &apos;## s long## standing propos## al to extend Regul## ation ( EC ) No 97## 6 / 19## 99 for a further two year## s . 
there are just two week## s to go be## fore the Regul## ation expir## es , creat## ing the risk that no fund## ing will be avail## able for project## s and programme## s under the European I## nitiative in the coming year . 
it will on## ly be possible for the Council to adopt a posit## ive decision be## fore the Regul## ation expir## es if the European Parliament vot## es in favour of the draft re## solution propos## ed by the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s today . 
in my view , this is in every## one &apos;## s enlighten## ed interest ; it is also in the political interest## s of the three institution## s involve## d in the legisl## ative process , and , above all , it is in the practical interest## s of th## ose whom the project## s support## ed by the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s are intend## ed to benefit , name## ly civil soci## e## ties and citizen## s in numer## ous countries a## round the world . 
the European I## nitiative is a well @## -## @ function## ing instrument : this is borne out by the statistic## s on the use of it## s budget fund## s as well as by al## most all the human right## s organisation## s which pay trib## ute to the I## nitiative and it## s valu## able work . 
it is wide## ly regard## ed as a success## ful instrument which provid## es direct support for civil soci## ety in man## y thir## d countries where human right## s viol## ations and , above all , a lack of democratic development are end## emic . 
the I## nitiative support## s numer## ous innov## ative and relev## ant project## s , s## uch as the abolition of the death penal## ty , torture prevent## ion and re## habilit## ation of torture victim## s , the advance## ment of the right## s of women - an issue which is e## special## ly dear to me - as well as campaign## ing for the right## s and interest## s of child## ren , indi## genous people and other marginal## ised group## s , and strength## ening international law . 
this focus## es , for ex## ample , on the Inter## national Criminal Court . 
it also aim## s to foster free## dom of express## ion and promot## e democratic development through elect## ion observ## ation mission## s . 
I believ## e that the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s is a vibr## ant express## ion of our share## d value## s and , above all , the European Union &apos;## s ident## ity in the world . 
I agree with the House , Mr President , that the I## nitiative must be effective and well @## -## @ manage## d . 
the Commission will there## fore scrutin## ise with attention and interest all the propos## al## s put forward by this House which aim to achiev## e great## er efficiency , the simpl## ification of procedure## s and the effective use of resource## s . 
to this end , let me give you my assurance## s that a mean## ing## ful , open and , above all , regular dia## logue will take place between Parliament and the Commission . 
I believ## e that this dia## logue will offer us the opportun## ity for joint discuss## ion of the political and object## ive priorit## ies of the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s . 
after all , Parliament &apos;## s and the Commission &apos;## s priorit## ies are large## ly ident## ical ; the## y include , for ex## ample , the need to support the European Union &apos;## s Neighbour## hood Poli## cy via the I## nitiative or to reinforce democratic development in a number of countries . 
it is there## fore import## ant , in my view - and this appli## es bo## th to my own and the work## ing level - for us to focus on the same priorit## ies , examin## e the need## s ar## ising in our Neighbour## hood Poli## cy together , and set the best possible priorit## ies on a joint bas## is . 
as parliament## arian## s , you have acquir## ed particular expert## ise which I would like to draw on . 
your support for the demo## cracy move## ment in Ukraine or the forth## coming EU Elect## ion Observ## er Miss## ion to Palestine , the West Bank and Gaz## a are eloqu## ent ex## ample## s , and all I can say is that I believ## e we will work well together here . 
let me conclude , Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , by express## ing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the modal## ities for this further dia## logue as swift## ly as possible in order to develop genuine## ly fruit## ful co## operation in this field in every## one &apos;## s interest . 
I look forward to our posit## ive co## operation , and I glad## ly put my service## s at your dispos## al . 
. Mr President , I thank the Commission## er for her open## ing remark## s . 
I am ver## y pleas## ed to see in the Chamber Mr## s M## organ## tini , the chair## man of the Committee on Develop## ment , Mr## s Flau## tre , the chair## man of the Sub## committee on Human Right## s , the shadow rapporteur and my co @## -## @ rapporteur on the Committee on Develop## ment , Mr F## er## nández Martín . 
there we## re two regulation## s , one of which ha## s al## read## y be## en adopt## ed by this House . 
the one we are deal## ing with now is that cover## ing thir## d countries . 
twelve year## s ago I was rapporteur and , as Mr Pat## ten ha## s describ## ed me , &apos; father &apos; of the European initiative for demo## cracy and human right## s , which prov## ed to be instrument## al in help## ing the transit## ional ex @## -## @ Soviet bloc countries . 
it was consider## ed by man## y as the European Union &apos;## s flag## ship schem## e for demo## cracy promot## ion . 
it ga## ve mean## ing to the preamble to the Maas## tri## cht Treat## y concern## ing the EU &apos;## s foreign policy priorit## ies . 
in it## s initial phase it was administ## er## ed by a small found## ation bas## ed in Bru## ssels , with bo## th the European Parliament and the Commission play## ing an active role in the al## location and super## vision of project## s . 
at it## s height in 19## 97 , the initiative was financ## ing and administ## er## ing a## round 1 200 project## s . 
in 19## 99 I visit## ed some of them in Bel## grade , including key pro @## -## @ demo## cracy media , s## uch as Radio B## 92 . 
the same year the initiative was take## n in @## -## @ house by the Commission . 
I have be## en concern## ed for a long time that the initiative ha## s become bureaucrat## ic and safe and that the European Parliament , as the on## ly democratic## ally elect## ed institution , should o## nce again play a great## er role . 
al## though the initiative current## ly ha## s a budget of some EUR 137 million , it lack## s vis## ibility and effective## ness . 
I am all the more convince## d of this follow## ing meet## ing## s on the ground and discuss## ions with more th## an 30 organisation## s . 
most re## cent## ly , I s## poke to the Associ## ation of Belarus## ian Journal## ists - current## ly here to receiv## e the Sakharov Prize - as well as the Eurasia Director of a US pro @## -## @ demo## cracy age## ncy . 
the## y we## re not even aware of the exist## ence of the European demo## cracy initiative . 
this is a ver## y valu## able programme and one that need## s to be ma## de more effective . 
an import## ant point to make is that un## like routine EU assist## ance , the European initiative does not require the host govern## ment &apos;## s consent . 
in a country s## uch as Belarus , not to s## peak of Tunis## ia or Iran , in which oper## ating through govern## ment channel## s is difficult and often im## possible , this can## not be under## estimate## d . 
in a paper on the EU securit## y strate## gy in 20## 03 , Jav## ier Sol## ana out## line## d the import## ance and sensitiv## ity of Europe &apos;## s new neighbour## hood . 
the result## ing policy invit## es our neighbour## s to the east and south to share in the peace , st## ability and prosper## ity that we enjoy in the European Union . 
it aim## s to creat## e a &apos; ring of friend## s &apos; a## round the border## s of the new enlarge## d European Union . 
sad## ly , the on## ly vis## ibility of the EU &apos;## s demo## cracy activities in the new neighbour## hood seem## s to be short observ## ation mission## s by Member## s of the European Parliament , s## uch as th## ose under## take## n re## cent## ly in Ukraine . 
I believ## e that all significant elect## ions in the new neighbour## hood should be the subject of full EU observ## ation mission## s . 
there is a feel## ing in Bru## ssels that demo## cracy can## not be export## ed and that change must come from with## in . 
how## ever , the Unit## ed State## s Nation## al End## ow## ment for Demo## cracy ha## s show## n since 19## 82 that the two can be combin## ed . 
it operate## s as an in## dependent expert age## ncy , us## ing N## GO## s on the ground , and is much respect## ed for it## s programme## s and method## ology . 
as well as the Unit## ed State## s activities , the West## min## ster Found## ation , for ex## ample , or the Germa## n and other N## GO## s have high## er vis## ibility and much less bureau## cracy th## an the European initiative . 
I re## cent## ly put together a document detail## ing the European Parliament &apos;## s pro @## -## @ demo## cracy activities , bo## th with## in the EU and external## ly . 
as Member## s , we particip## ate in a myriad of inter## parliament## ary delegation## s , consult## ation committee## s and inform## al group## s . 
valu## able work is be## ing done , but the work is fragment## ed .
