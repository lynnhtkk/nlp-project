the same can be s## aid about the European initiative . 
to my mind , our involve## ment should be co## ordinate## d in a demo## cracy centre , bas## ed in this House , mandate## d to act as a research unit , an over## sight body on all the EU &apos;## s pro @## -## @ demo## cracy activities . 
to take an ex## ample , the web## site of the State Department &apos;## s Bur## eau for Demo## cracy , Human Right## s and Lab## or boast## s that the Unit## ed State## s ha## s oversee## n the transit## ion of 87 countries to democratic states . 
is this a statistic that the EU wish## es to leave in the hand## s of the Unit## ed State## s al## one ? 
last week## end &apos;## s G## 8 Con## ference in Ra## bat - and I am de## light## ed that the Commission## er was present - co @## -## @ financ## ed by the European Union , further develop## ed plan## s for the For## um for the Futu## re , first introduce## d at the Sea Island Summit in Ju## ne 20## 04 , to promot## e demo## cracy in the Middle East and North Africa . 
de## spite the financial contribut## ion of the European Union to s## uch an import## ant e## vent , it is the American## s ra## ther th## an the European Union who are lead## ing this activity . 
we recognis## e that the Unit## ed State## s programme essential## ly echo## es the principle## s of the Bar## celona process and now the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy . 
in 20## 05 , the Unit## ed K## ing## dom will take over the preside## ncy of bo## th the G## 8 and the European Union . 
I sincere## ly hope that there will be a great## er focus on the 2## 50 million Arab## s who want demo## cracy , as illust## rated by the 20## 02 Unit## ed Nation## s Develop## ment Report , as well as the manifest## ly fail## ing countries to our east . 
. 
Mr President , Commission## er , I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human right## s . 
you will al## ways be welcome . 
Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott ha## s gone over this Regul## ation , a regulation that clear## ly demonst## rates all our virtue## s - our man## y virtue## s - and also man## y of our problem## s . 
it is a modest regulation in term## s of it## s budget , but ver## y ambitious in term## s of it## s object## ive## s ; we all agree on the need to approve it but , n## ever## the## less , we have spent a year and a half - per## hap## s much more - deal## ing with procedural and bureaucrat## ic issue## s which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue , which is to approve it on time and proper## ly s## o that the Commission may have an instrument allow## ing it to maintain the Regul## ation . 
it ha## s be## en a ver## y complex process . 
at the end of the last term in office we approve## d a regulation similar to this , by mean## s of co @## -## @ decision , re## l## ating to thir## d countries . 
and now we are approach## ing the ent## ry in## to force of the necess## ary extens## ion , which begin## s on 1 Janu## ary and end## s at the end of 20## 06 . 
the Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is high## ly valu## ed by Parliament . 
what we have reiterate## d now in the amend## ments that in the end have not be## en vot## ed for are ver## y simpl## e thing## s which at that time we found it difficult to make under## stood . 
Parliament wish## es to be inform## ed and to know the result## s and the progress of the application of this project and want## s these programme## s to provid## e fund## ing , as the Commission## er ha## s point## ed out , for peace mission## s and mission## s of elector## al observ## ers . 
further## more , it would like the Commission to present , on an annual bas## is or at inter## val## s it consider## s appropriate , an ana## lysis of the progress and result## s of the application of this project . 
I suspect that the agree## ment reach## ed at the end of the last term in office by mean## s of co @## -## @ decision , with the Committee on Develop## ment respons## ible for the main report , ha## s be## en mod## ified unilateral## ly . 
I hope that this will now be correct## ed , on the bas## is of the application of the Regul## ation , which provid## es the Commission with the fund## s necess## ary for the application of an effective instrument , as this one is , for promot## ing demo## cracy and human right## s . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , promot## ing demo## cracy and human right## s in the world should be one of the priorit## ies of the EU &apos;## s external relation## s . 
we feel empower## ed by our own , wide## ly @## -## @ held understand## ing of the con## cept of the human race and of every human be## ing , and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a free## r world , a world that can be fair## er , a world cap## able of build## ing justice in free## dom and , con## sequent## ly , a more peace## ful and safe## r world . 
by firm## ly commit## ting our## selves to the European initiative on demo## cracy and human right## s , we are promot## ing demo## cracy , peace , the human race and securit## y , all at the same time . 
we must n## ever lose sight of this , as we fine @## -## @ tune the instrument## s that we establish and as we administ## er the resource## s that we allocate direct## ly to this action area . 
after a number of year## s &quot; experience , I should like to make some observ## ations . 
first## ly , Parliament should be more involve## d in programme## s specific## ally develop## ed and support## ed in this field . 
the amend## ments that have be## en propos## ed to the regulation will address this question sufficient## ly , provid## ed , of course , the Commission accept## s them in the right spirit and make## s a broad and extens## ive interpret## ation of the new guide## line## s , there## by taking relation## s with Parliament to a more open and close## r level . 
this is what we are call## ing for . 
it is also necess## ary , how## ever , to express our opinion on other issue## s that concern us more . 
first## ly , are we going to dilut## e these instrument## s in## to more and more area## s , more line## s and more them## es , or are we first going to set out a clear strate## gy , and th## en concentr## ate on a guide## line that drive## s us forward and on fundamental priorit## ies ? 
I believ## e that the latter is the right way . 
the con## cept of human right## s is increas## ing## ly broad and also some## time## s more vague . 
there is also the tempt## ation to use th## ose instrument## s for any## thing and every## thing . 
this to my mind would be the wrong way ; it would reduce the effective## ness of what we do and lead to a waste of s## cant resource## s , or to the duplic## ation of instrument## s . 
there are man## y other instrument## s for poli## cies on co## operation and development with thir## d countries , but these instrument## s of the European initiative for demo## cracy and human right## s are high## ly political and should be focus## ed prim## arily on promot## ing demo## cracy and that fundamental nucleus of civic and political right## s , free## dom of con## science and religio## n , free## dom of express## ion and debate , the separat## ion of power## s and the rule of law , free## dom of organisation and activity of political part## ies and civil soci## ety , the opportun## ity to hold free and fair elect## ions and the vital## ity of open and plural soci## e## ties . 
to conclude , we must also ask our## selves if we are going to take the path of increas## ing bureau## cracy and official## dom in carry## ing out these poli## cies , or will we be able to make th## ose instrument## s more agile ? 
this , more th## an any## thing , is what I ask of the Commission ; that it be cap## able of taking risk## s and that it set out the most advent## ur## ous , most dar## ing and most incisive line## s of action . 
bureau## cracy and official## dom would lead to th## ose instrument## s be## ing total## ly un## us## ed for one simpl## e and intuitive reason . 
we can## not re## ly on dictator## s to encourag## e and promot## e demo## cracy in the## ir countries . 
we must there## fore be more agile and must know how to take our help to exact## ly where it is need## ed , exact## ly where it is lack## ing and exact## ly where it will make a differ## ence . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to welcome the Commission## er on be## half of our group . 
let me come straight to the point . 
this even## ing Parliament is be## ing ask## ed to approve the extens## ion of the specific human right## s and demo## cracy programme for two year## s . 
our group ha## s no object## ion in principle . 
d## uring the re## cent month## s of dia## logue with the Commission , how## ever , we have plac## ed some political conditio## ns on our assent : that is to say , we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structure## d dia## logue with Parliament . 
it is not a question of our claim## ing manage## ment respons## ibil## ities that do not fall with## in this Parliament &apos;## s remit , but ra## ther of claim## ing the power to carry out a political evalu## ation of this measure and , more general## ly , of all initiative## s re## l## ating to the development of demo## cracy and action on human right## s . 
we ask to be able to carry out an evalu## ation of the priorit## ies of the initiative## s and an evalu## ation of the## ir qual## ity and the degree to which the## y have succeed## ed in adv## ancing demo## cracy in real term## s . 
in other word## s , Commission## er , this Parliament is ask## ing to be involve## d in defi## ning the guide## line## s for our action## s and in judging the effective## ness of the result## s we obtain . 
in re## cent year## s , man## y question## s have remain## ed un## answer## ed and a great deal of inform## ation either ha## s not arriv## ed or ha## s be## en sup## plied in a high## ly summarise## d form . 
we do not know the ex## tent of the fund## s actual## ly spent through this programme , which project## s have be## en conclude## d , where the## y we## re car## ried out or with what concrete result## s - be## cause in some countries the fund## s have be## en froze## n - or in## de## ed what is be## ing done to un## freeze the fund## s . 
we do not want to break the sacr## ed rule## s of com## it## ology , but it is a question of find## ing a for a relation## ship that is not just bas## ed on a verb## al express## ion of good will . 
Commission## er , we appreci## ate your offer of collabo## ration , and our will## ing## ness to extend the life of this programme should be interpret## ed as an act of trust . 
it is import## ant to make it clear that Parliament must not be regard## ed , as it often is , as a not## ary who is call## ed in to formal## ly approve the account## s but who ha## s to confine him## self to that al## one . 
that is not in the interest## s either of Parliament or of the Comm## un## ity institution## s . 
in this regard , we believ## e that this programme should be stream## line## d and speed## ed up as much as possible . 
great## er respons## ibil## ities should be give## n to local non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s on the ground , and more emphasis should be plac## ed on micro## project## s and on certain campaign## s that in the past have ma## de some head## way in the difficult area of demo## cracy in some countries . 
we have to work a li## ttle hard## er on demo## cracy , as we have neglect## ed it up to now while focus## ing our operation## s on the area of human right## s . 
natural## ly , it is also necess## ary to develop a capacity for dia## logue , for which , Commission## er , Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vot## e . 
we hope , how## ever , that from tomor## row this will become a dai## ly dia## logue - not just a formal## ity but a dia## logue of sub## stance - to assess the decision## s that have be## en ma## de and to define the object## ive## s that we set our## selves . 
- Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , per## hap## s we should start with the ver## y time## ly question posed quit## e right## ly by Mr Fava regard## ing the dia## logue between our institution## s . 
it is a recur## ring them## e , which by the way make## s this late s## itt## ing at this late season of the year worth## while . 
on this subject , Commission## er , we have heard you say and we have read - and you also s## aid in your hear## ing - that you want## ed to maintain a dia## logue that people can describ## e as the## y see fit , but which I in any case under## stood to be regular , relev## ant , open and prolong## ed , or , in short , structure## d . 
this propos## al , the offer of dia## logue , is clear## ly one that Parliament will jump at , be## cause , as you know , the Member## s of this House are eager to have the opportun## ity to engage in in @## -## @ depth discuss## ions about the direct## ion and on## going monitor## ing of this initiative and to receiv## e inform## ation about program## ming . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , the ball is in our court and I am s## ure that the Commission would be de## light## ed to see a propos## al emanate from our rank## s , from our committee## s and group## s , in short from our Parliament , s## o that this dia## logue can get under## way ver## y quick## ly , be## cause it is ur## gent## ly need## ed , with a group of Member## s who are well @## -## @ motivate## d and have some expert## ise on this issue , and there is no short## age of s## uch people in this institution . 
let us return to the initiative . 
I think that we need to reiterate the ex## tent to which it bring## s add## ed value to all of the action## s that the European Union might under## take on demo## cracy and human right## s . 
it ha## s per## hap## s not be## en s## aid often en## ough that it is the on## ly mean## s at our dispos## al to support , again## st the will of govern## ments that are often autocrat## ic or dictator## ial , civil soci## ety , act## ivist## s and N## GO## s work## ing in conditio## ns that are often extreme## ly complic## ated . 
it is the on## ly instrument that en## able## s us to act in this way , and it is extreme## ly pre## cious . 
in add## ition , I would add that the aid that is give## n to N## GO## s in this way is perceiv## ed on the ground as be## ing neutral , that is to say that the European Union is not provid## ing these grant## s in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceiv## ed as do## ing s## o , contr## ary to the claim## s ma## de when American age## ncies work on the ground , with s## uch claim## s ver## y often heard in Mag## hreb , in any case . 
it is a ver## y pre## cious asset , ma## de possible by the qual## ity of the European Union &apos;## s intervention . 
of course there is s## till room for improve## ment . 
one of the issue## s , and we all know of man## y ex## ample## s , is that some N## GO## s can## not , for one reason or an## other , be support## ed under this initiative . 
the govern## ments of thir## d countries which do not wish to see democratic move## ments develop in the## ir mid## st are not lack## ing in resource## s or imagin## ation . 
we have case## s of legal N## GO## s be## ing grant## ed support under the initiative and th## en be## ing quit## e simpl## y ban## ned from receiv## ing the grant by a political decree or by direct censur## e . 
all of the decision## s have be## en take## n , but these N## GO## s are prevent## ed from benefit## ing from the fund## s grant## ed to them . 
we have other ex## ample## s of associ## ations which quit## e simpl## y do not legal## ly exist . 
in s## uch case## s we have to resort to sub## ter## fu## ge , and we there## fore need the ability to be flex## ible and find ing## en## ious solution## s on the ground to achiev## e our go## al## s . 
I should like to conclude by say## ing that this debate would serve no purpose if we we## re not al## read## y think## ing beyond 20## 07 . 
and there , as other Member## s have right## ly done , I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work with## in this Parliament to ensu## re that this pre## cious asset , that we can al## ways improve , is able to endur## e beyond 20## 06 . 
that is what is at s## take in the debate## s that we are going to have to hold at vari## ous different level## s with## in this Parliament . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I too should like to welcome the Commission## er and I particular## ly appreci## ate the fact that s## he is a woman . 
I fully agree with the need to extend the implement## ing arrange## ments re## l## ating to human right## s , development and demo## cracy . 
I congratul## ate Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott and I e## special## ly share the opinion of Mr F## er## nández Martín - in line with the vot## e I cast in committee - particular## ly on the amend## ment specific## ally call## ing on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the program## ming and to report back to Parliament on the implement## ation . 
I have , how## ever , in the word## s of Mr## s Ferr## ero @## -## @ Wal## d## ner , seize## d upon the Commission &apos;## s will## ing## ness to collabo## rate and also to hold a serious and in @## -## @ depth dia## logue not on## ly on the general guide## line## s but also on project execu## tion . 
I tru## ly hope , a## mong## st other thing## s , that this dia## logue will also take place direct## ly with the Committee on Develop## ment , which I chair , since the issue## s of human right## s , the empower## ment of women and demo## cracy are in fact close## ly link## ed to the question of development . 
I should like to say to my ver## y like## able fellow Member Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott that I understand hi## s frust## ration and I agree about this pre## cious project , as Mr## s Flau## tre put it . 
in fact , parent## s can## not al## ways bear to see the## ir child## ren grow up . 
quit## e frank## ly , I would not want to emul## ate the Unit## ed State## s , be## cause the## ir action## s have ver## y often led to the rise of dictator## ships - I am think## ing of the Pino## chet regime , for ex## ample . 
I believ## e the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East ha## s al## read## y be## en repudi## ated by man## y in the Middle East be## cause it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help . 
I should there## fore like us to retain our own individual character and also to value the import## ant work that we are do## ing . 
we do not actual## ly want to export demo## cracy , but we want demo## cracy to grow and to have the ability to grow , and we can provid## e the tool## s for that purpose . 
through visit## ing conflict zone## s and see## ing the huge number of project## s , I have realis## ed that the ability to act with## out going through the author## ities is fundamental## ly import## ant . 
the question## s of torture , train## ing and recover## y , as well as the question of the empower## ment of women have be## en extreme## ly import## ant . 
I think we re## ally need to continu## e a## long this path , but obvi## ously in the knowledge that there are man## y limit## ations and man## y short## coming## s , including in the area of finance . 
I should not like us to confine our## selves to elect## ion observ## ation mission## s , which ver## y often can## not actual## ly be take## n ver## y serious## ly if you consider that the## y on## ly last one day . 
I should re## ally like us to continu## e oper## ating a## long line## s where## by our aid and our action## s can tru## ly be a tool for help## ing demo## cracy to grow and not for im## posing our value## s . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I am de## light## ed to say that Mr## s Ferr## ero @## -## @ Wal## d## ner is the right person in the right place . 
this can## not be s## aid of all her colleague## s , but that is no fault of her## s . 
the European Parliament &apos;## s role is be## coming ever more import## ant with## in the EU institution## s , and it## s author## ity is be## coming ever great## er a## mong## st the public in the Member State## s . 
after 25 year## s as a direct## ly @## -## @ elect## ed body , Parliament &apos;## s import## ance is now at it## s height . 
y## et we should not deriv## e satisf## action from the strength## ening of Parliament &apos;## s role as a result of battle## s of compete## nce or procedure with## in the European Union . 
to a great## er ex## tent th## an pre## vi## ously , the European Parliament &apos;## s role must be to promot## e demo## cracy in the world and to provid## e inform## ation on value## s and standard## s . 
these value## s and standard## s ensu## re that , al## though our soci## e## ties and political system## s are not ideal , there are few## er war## s and more dia## logue on our continent , less viol## ence and more compromis## e , and less institutional aggress## ion and more international and institutional co## operation . 
this is not a matter of promot## ing European value## s . 
it is a matter of inform## ing people about a style of politic## s bas## ed on a search for the common good and on widen## ing particip## ation in govern## ment at every level . 
this is the role of bo## th the European Union and the European Parliament today . 
is EUR 1## 00 million too much to spend on promot## ing demo## cracy in the world ? 
it is un## doubt## ed## ly not en## ough , y## et even a s## um f## ive time## s great## er would s## till be much cheap## er th## an going to the expense of repair## ing the effect## s of a lack of demo## cracy . 
it would cost a great deal more to provid## e assist## ance to the victim## s of civil and international war## s that break out be## cause politic## ians in man## y countries do not understand the mean## ing of demo## cracy . 
the## y on## ly know it as a not## ion found in foreign language phrase book## s . 
if more th## an EUR 1## 00 million we## re to be grant## ed , it would of course be necess## ary to monitor bo## th our own institution## s and the organisation## s receiv## ing the fund## ing . 
in conclusion , I should like to offer my sincere thank## s to Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott , the rapporteur , for hi## s work . 
I hope the House will continu## e to work together on this issue , regard## less of political division## s , and that it will work to## ward## s the go## al## s refer## red to by Mr## s Ferr## ero @## -## @ Wal## d## ner and the rapporteur . 
Mr President , I join with other## s in wel## coming the new Commission## er to this debate . 
we look forward to work## ing with her and , in## de## ed , we look forward to the Commission &apos;## s plan## s in 20## 05 and 20## 06 on this budget line , the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomor## row . 
I support the fact that this is a budget line that reach## es the grass## root## s and that civil soci## ety in the countries ha## s a priorit## y in receiv## ing the mon## ies . 
I also support the fact that the Commission is plan## ning to make conflict prevent## ion a per## man## ent priorit## y for this budget line . 
s## ure## ly demo## cracy is the best instrument of conflict prevent## ion in our world . 
I support what the Commission ha## s done in term## s of im## prov## ing the contact## s and support from it## s own delegation## s in thir## d countries for project## s under these line## s , and also the## ir plan## s to extend fund## ing for micro @## -## @ project## s , in particular for local N## GO## s in thir## d countries who are most valu## ed by us in this Parliament . 
if I have a word of critic## ism , it is that every year the Commission## er &apos;## s predecessor us## ed to s## peak about human right## s and th## en come in with a prelimin## ary draft budget that cut this line - last year from EUR 1## 27 million to EUR 1## 05 million . 
per## hap## s the Commission## er will cho## ose not to do that in forth## coming year## s . 
in## de## ed , as Mr## s Flau## tre ha## s s## aid , I hope that , whi## lst there are proper object## ive## s for simpl## ification of the budget , this particular line ha## s symbol## ic import## ance and will be maintain## ed in the medium and long term . 
I also draw to her attention the increas## ing demand## s from international organisation## s , like the ad hoc tribunal## s for Yugoslav## ia and Rwanda and the Inter## national Criminal Court . 
how## ever , if these are to be fund## ed from this budget line there must be a significant increas## e or N## GO## s will fail . 
I oppose the attempt to reduce the priorit## y give## n to project## s world## wide under this budget line and re## focus on near Europe . 
that is a mistake : human right## s are universal in our world . 
final## ly , I express my respect for the rapporteur , Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott , and hi## s sincere interest in this budget line ; but I am pleas## ed that he with## drew hi## s amend## ments , which I believ## e represent## ed micro @## -## @ manage## ment of this budget line . 
the Commission &apos;## s commit## ment to structure## d dia## logue , as it put it , is one that we should welcome , and , with my colleague## s on Parliament &apos;## s Sub## committee on Human Right## s , I ver## y much look forward to eng## aging with the new Commission## er on that . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , man## y thank## s for this debate . 
first## ly , let me say to the V## ice @## -## @ President , Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott , that if he had not al## read## y invent## ed this interest## ing procedure , we would have to invent it now . 
I am absolut## e## ly convince## d that it is a good thing , for I have al## ways be## en high## ly commit## ted to human right## s . 
in other word## s , you can count on the fact that you are deal## ing with some## one who re## ally believ## es in what the## y are do## ing . 
let me say again that there will be genuine dia## logue , not on## ly at my level but also at work## ing level . 
I would like to reiterate this point un## equi## vocal## ly . 
I do not agree that all we have done is observ## e elect## ions . 
I can cite a host of ex## ample## s demonst## rating that this is not the case . 
we need on## ly think of Ukraine , where a varie## ty of project## s is under way . 
let me cite a few ex## ample## s to show you that we re## ally can## not view the situ## ation in s## uch narrow term## s . 
the Commission is al## read## y provid## ing support here : for ex## ample , it ha## s give## n EUR 3## 00 000 to the European Centre for Common G## round , EUR 3## 34 000 to the Inter## national Hel## s## ink## i Fede## ration for Human Right## s : im## prov## ing the Human Right## s Si## tu## ation in Ukraine through Lega## l Aid Pro## vid## ed by N## GO## s , EUR 78## 7 000 to the European Roma Right## s C## enter : defend## ing the right## s of Roma in Ukraine , EUR 68## 5 000 to the K## hark## iv Human Right## s Protect## ion Group , and s## o on . 
these are just a few of the project## s . 
let me turn to an## other region of the world which is ver## y import## ant to you and , in## de## ed , to me , name## ly the South## ern Medi## terranean , the Arab region , al## though this does not on## ly include the Arab countries , it also include## s Israel , of course . 
one ex## ample is the project entitle## d Palestine : Democrat## ization from the Gra## s## s## root## s , Media and Net## work## ing as a To## ol for Comm## un## ity Develop## ment , which is import## ant in that it focus## es prim## arily on civil soci## ety . 
let me reiterate : I am particular## ly pleas## ed - and I think this is a fortunate co## incidence - that I was able to present seven action plan## s re## cent## ly to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Mon## day . 
the Commission and the Council have adopt## ed the propos## al## s and every## one s## poke about them in ver## y posit## ive term## s . 
why ? 
be## cause these action plan## s will en## able us to bring our value## s , name## ly human right## s and every## thing with which the## y are associate## d - name## ly the rule of law , human right## s and demo## cracy - to these countries , s## uch as Ukraine , as s## oon as free and fair elect## ions have take## n place there . 
after that , the implement## ation begin## s . 
how## ever , the## y also focus on a poor y## et import## ant country like the Republic of Moldova , where we also need to take action . 
Belarus is a separat## e case which I will come back to in a moment . 
th## en , of course , there are the major countries in the Middle East which are read## y for this process , not## ably Jordan , Moro## cco , Tunis## ia , Palestine and Israel . 
the present## ation of these seven action plan## s at this time offer## s a re## ally good opportun## ity , in my view , to work together with and on these countries . 
natural## ly , the action plan## s also offer opportun## ities for us to present our priorit## ies a## long## side the countries &apos; own priorit## ies and promot## e demo## cracy and human right## s . 
I would like to out## line some of the campaign## s which we are carry## ing out with## in our human right## s programme . 
I admit that the## y do not amount to a mass## ive s## um , but it is s## till consider## able , and I believ## e that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail . 
campaign 1 is entitle## d &apos; Pro## motion , justice and dign## ity &apos; . 
this target## s criminal justice , support## s universal abolition of the death penal## ty , and support## s the work of international mechan## ism## s which monitor and report on respect for human right## s and relate## d international treat## y oblig## ations . 
campaign 2 , which is e## special## ly dear to me , is entitle## d &apos; Fo## ster## ing a culture of human right## s &apos; : human right## s educ## ation , train## ing , monitor## ing and aware## ness @## -## @ ra## ising by target## ing advance## ment of right## s of marginal## ised or vulner## able group## s - that mean## s the right## s of women and child## ren - including female genital mutil## ation , traffick## ing of women , human right## s defend## ers ; torture prevent## ion and re## habilit## ation of torture victim## s , programme## s of high## er educ## ation and train## ing for professional## s , support for human right## s dia## logue## s . 
s## o , on the whole , it is a ver## y import## ant campaign . 
campaign 3 is entitle## d &apos; Pro## mot## ing democratic process &apos; . 
this is essential for all these soci## e## ties , e## special## ly for the Middle East or the broad## er Middle East , which I will come to later . 
s## o there is a lot of development of particip## atory demo## cracy , foster## ing inform## ed plural## istic dis## course with civil soci## ety , target## ing free## dom of associ## ation , free## dom of express## ion , in## dependent press , broadcast## ing , un## impede## d access to the Inter## net , and elect## ion observ## ation mission## s . 
campaign 4 is entitle## d &apos; Adv## ancing equal## ity , tolerance and peace &apos; , embrac## es the issue## s of racial discrimin## ation , xeno## phobia , right## s of minor## ities , indi## genous people## s . 
th## en there is the s## elect## ion of region## s and countries and match## ing them with e## ach of the four campaign## s . 
all that is foresee## n for 20## 07 , and in the next financial perspective there will be on## ly six finance regulation## s , four of which are ver## y import## ant one## s : enlarge## ment , development , good neighbour## hood policy and st## ability . 
in all of them , demo## cracy and human right## s are in the mainstream , which is a real achiev## e## ment on the bas## is of which we can work . 
there is the## matic program## ming here . 
return## ing to Belarus , which we s## poke about in the Council re## cent## ly , I explain## ed that I want## ed to work specific## ally with the N## GO## s . 
we th## en receiv## ed an invit## ation from Lithuania to hold a work## shop there . 
s## o we will have three phase## s : first## ly , two phase## s in the Commission , and th## en we will confer with Parliament . 
th## en there is also an invit## ation from Lithuania , be## cause Lithuania , Po## land and man## y of these countries know where we have to start with N## GO## s . 
you are right : we can on## ly work with civil soci## ety there , be## cause we can## not work with govern## ments at this s## tage . 
on the broad## er Middle East , I was ver## y interest## ed in this new possibil## ity for co## operation . 
it is tru## e that we have be## en work## ing for ten year## s with the countries of the Middle East , the southern bas## in of the Medi## terranean . 
the Unit## ed State## s is now do## ing some## thing similar . 
it is a good initiative , be## cause the more we can work in parallel and thu## s bring more demo## cracy and easi## er access to demo## cracy to the region , the better . 
I now turn to some other more formal question## s . 
accord## ing to the inform## ation I have , for reason## s of jurid## ical coher## ence , the Council ha## s now re## introduce## d the amend## ments table## d by Parliament when Regul## ations ( EC ) No## s 97## 5 / 19## 99 and 97## 6 / 19## 99 we## re at the draft## ing s## tage . 
I hope this inform## ation is welcome to the Member## s who ra## ised this . 
in order to work better with N## GO## s it was essential to have de## concentr## ation , as we call it . 
that mean## s that we have give## n a lot of respons## ibility to the delegation## s , that are also in a much better position to conduct a survey on what N## GO## s are do## ing . 
this is also why we will follow development## s much better . 
I hope that there will be better control be## cause I know that while , on the one hand , we should have a speed## y mean## s of action , on the other hand we also have to be ver## y care## ful and to control thing## s proper## ly . 
this is what I want## ed to say . 
in## de## ed , it is an offer of dia## logue on my part . 
I thank you for taking it . 
we are not perfect , but there is a posit## ive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this posit## ive spirit to work together for the major value## s of our European Union - that is , human right## s . 
. Mr President , as the Commission## er will find , the European Parliament al## ways ha## s the last word . 
I am pleas## ed that the Commission is begin## ning to examin## e the possibil## ity of do## ing some work in Belarus . 
I mention## ed Belarus , and also Tunis## ia and Iran : two other countries where nothing is happen## ing . 
I am grat## e## ful for the good will and the commit## ment of the Commission## er in her new post , and we welcome her in## to it . 
I also welcome her commit## ment to establish some work## ing @## -## @ level co## operation between Parliament and the Commission . 
I advis## e the Commission that this week the European Parliament , through the good office## s of the Human Right## s Sub## committee , is commission## ing a stu## dy by in## dependent expert## s in## to the operation of this programme . 
it is some## thing I ask## ed for last year from the Commission , but it was un## will## ing to give it . 
this will be complete## d by Fe## bru## ary . 
may I make one final remark , since I know the Commission## er was in Ra## bat at the week## end and we are deal## ing with a vast and import## ant age## nda : the process of reform in the Middle East . 
when I beg## an work## ing on this report , the fund## s avail## able from the European I## nitiative on Demo## cracy and Human Right## s to the entire Middle East we## re four per cent of the total . 
give## n the circum## stance## s of the last three year## s , that was an extra## ordinarily low figure . 
I am pleas## ed the Commission is now adjust## ing that , and we need to re## focus the programme . 
not## with## standing what Mr Ho## witt s## aid , we have strategic object## ive## s and strategic priorit## ies . 
I am pleas## ed to see the Commission is now begin## ning to focus on th## ose . 
I thank the Commission## er for her word## s and for her commit## ment , and we look forward to work## ing together construct## ive## ly and practical## ly , but on the bas## is of equal interest in the development of demo## cracy , particular## ly in our neighbour## hood . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place tomor## row at 11.## 30 a.m . 
the next item is the debate on the report by Mr Papa## dimoulis on the propos## al for a Council decision amend## ing Decision 19## 99 / 84## 7 / EC as regard## s the extens## ion of the Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection . 
. Mr President , I am pleas## ed that Parliament support## s the Commission &apos;## s propos## al for the extens## ion of the Comm## un## ity action programme on civil protection for the year## s 20## 05 and 20## 06 . 
I ver## y much appreci## ate the ef## fort## s that have gone in## to this report , in particular the work of Mr Papa## dimoulis , the rapporteur . 
be## fore I go in## to detail on this report , I think it is worth recall## ing the work done under the au## spice## s of this action plan since it## s adopt## ion in Dec## ember 19## 99 . 
the object## ive## s of the civil protection action programme are to help to ensu## re better protection for people , the environment and proper## ty in the e## vent of natural or techno## logical disaster## s a## cross the Comm## un## ity . 
the action programme ha## s fund## ed a range of use## ful project## s , exchange## s of expert## s and work## shop## s that build in## valu## able co## operation and also mutual assist## ance between the Member State## s &apos; civil protection service## s . 
the action programme support## s and supplement## s ef## fort## s at national , regional and local level## s . 
emphasis ha## s be## en put on major project## s concern## ing prevent## ion , inform## ation of the public , cris## is manage## ment , disaster medicine and network## ing a## mong the different volunteer associ## ations active on the ground . 
in re## cent year## s we have seen major disaster## s . 
you will recall the flood## s in central and eastern Europe in the summer of 20## 02 , the oil s## pill , also in the same year , the unprecedented heat## wave and de## vast## ating forest fire## s in southern Europe in the summer of 20## 03 . 
this year we we## re shock## ed by the viol## ent terrorist attack in Madrid and sadden## ed by the earth## quake## s in Iran and Moro## cco . 
these even## ts clear## ly illust## rated the need for further action to strength## en prevent## ion and prepar## ed## ness measure## s and also to enhance our ability to respond rapid## ly and in solid## arity as a European Union . 
the Commission believ## es that major progress ha## s be## en ma## de in re## cent year## s in the contribut## ion and role of the EU in civil protection . 
the rapporteur ha## s right## ly high## light## ed some issue## s in the report , and these are bo## th valu## able and construct## ive remark## s that we will take in## to account in our futur## e work . 
I would like to react im## mediate## ly to a number of point## s . 
the report re## commend## s &apos; better s## har## ing of inform## ation on avail## able resource## s , expert## ise and success## ful strate## gies and practice## s at national level &apos; . 
the Commission agree## s that our data## base of resource## s should be further upgrad## ed and contain more data on respons## ive capacities , associate## d cost## s and avail## able equip## ment . 
the Commission is current## ly work## ing with Member State## s on these issue## s . 
the report argue## s for an improve## d operation## al frame## work for volunteer## s and for the establish## ment of guide## line## s for the## ir work . 
this is a helpful suggest## ion and echo## es the emphasis that the Commission is now put## ting on the work on this subject , which was and will remain a priorit## y for financ## ing in 20## 05 . 
let me turn to the issue of financ## ing assist## ance d## uring emerge## ncies . 
this is an issue of concern to us , but depend## s on having a sufficient level of fund## ing avail## able . 
for the time be## ing the budget## ary resource## s avail## able on## ly permit financ## ing of expert## s who travel to the scene of disaster## s to assess need## s for assist## ance . 
additional financ## ing depend## s at present on the don## ating and receiv## ing Member State## s . 
I should like to add that there is also , as you know , the possibil## ity to use the EU Solidar## ity Fund to provid## e compens## ation to a country suffer## ing sever## e damage from a disaster . 
final## ly , the report ask## s the Commission to provid## e a report on the programme in 20## 06 . 
we have no difficult## y in accept## ing this re## quest . 
with these remark## s , I reiterate my thank## s to the rapporteur and to Parliament as a whole for this thought## ful and construct## ive opinion . 
may I add that my colleague , Commission## er Dim## as , s## end## s hi## s apolog## ies for not be## ing here . 
he is in Buenos Air## es and ask## ed me to replace him . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , the debate on this report come## s , as the Commission## er not## ed , after a s## eries of major natural disaster## s in re## cent year## s which ra## ise the question of the need to strength## en the Comm## un## ity action programme : flood## s , heat @## -## @ wave## s , forest fire## s , earth## quake## s , serious poll## ution incident## s from toxic waste or oil s## pill## s , s## uch as that from the , as well as serious industrial accident## s and also terrorist attack## s . 
my country , Greece , is current## ly ex## peri## enc## ing immens## e anxie## ty as the result of the hijack## ing of a bus with sever## al host## age## s who## s## e live## s are in danger . 
these danger## s and these disaster## s have man## y victim## s and cause ever great## er economic los## s## es ; the## y disrupt the econom## ies of the countries affect## ed , hit## ting in particular the poor## est and most vulner## able section## s of the population . 
that is precise## ly why action also need## s to be take## n by govern## ments , prevent## ive measure## s need to be strength## ened and respons## e capacities need to be extend## ed . 
the Comm## un## ity respons## e to this problem is the Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection . 
this programme expir## es in a few days , on 31 Dec## ember 20## 04 , and we need to approve this propos## al which I have prepar## ed , in order to avoid a gap until s## uch time as the new programme is prepar## ed . 
that is why I support the Commission propos## al to prolong this programme for the next two year## s , just as I support the Commission propos## al on the necess## ary increas## e in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annual## ly , which was the amount in 20## 04 , to EUR 2.## 4 million annual## ly for the next two year## s . 
you may say it is not a big increas## e . 
I agree , but it is absolut## e## ly essential in order to finance increas## ed need## s due to enlarge## ment and to finance the action programme to combat marine poll## ution which ha## s be## en decide## d in the mean## time . 
un## fortunate## ly , it would appear that the Council of Minister## s does not have the same percept## ion as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission , and the Council also need## s to understand that the decision## s which we take in order to do certain thing## s also need the money necess## ary for the## ir implement## ation . 
other## wise , we s## hall not be consist## ent in our oblig## ations to## ward## s the citizen## s and it is precise## ly at time## s of natural disaster## s that th## ose who vot## ed for us and s## ent us here need to see the European Union and the European Parliament by the## ir side . 
this programme there## fore need## s to proceed and , at the same time , certain point## s in it need to be improve## d on the bas## is of experience obtain## ed to d## ate . 
in stu## dy## ing the problem , I have ident## ified seven sector## s in which improve## ments are need## ed in practice , be## cause on paper the system look## s good , but on the ground experience to d## ate ha## s show## n that it ha## s serious short## coming## s . 
one , better s## har## ing of inform## ation on avail## able resource## s , expert## ise and success## ful strate## gies at national level . 
the data## base , it## s data and the capacity for fast communic## ation and co## ordination need to be improve## d , in other word## s the computer data## base need## s to be upgrad## ed . 
two , more train## ing for intervention team## s . 
experience ha## s show## n that more regular train## ing is need## ed for better co## operation and inter## oper## ability . 
three , better communic## ation , co## ordination , in @## -## @ time inform## ation system## s for the prompt inform## ation of the public and link## s with other network## s . 
four , fund## ing : not simpl## y increas## ing fund## ing but safeguard## ing speed## ier respons## e with the re## lease of the source of fund## ing and concentr## ating all the appropri## ations need## ed under one head## ing . 
f## ive , strength## ening social partner## ship with a more active involve## ment of civil soci## ety and local author## ities . 
increas## ing the number of volunteer## s . 
six , empower## ment of research and development of emerge## ncy system## s for a more efficient manage## ment of disaster## s . 
and seven , implement## ation of the principle of subsid## i## arity and reinforce## ment of the draw## ing up of national plan## s for emerge## ncy co## ordination , a sector in which numer## ous Member State## s have serious short## coming## s . 
for the reason## s which I have describ## ed to you and s## o as not to be too long## wind## ed , be## cause it is al## read## y quit## e late , I call on the European Parliament to approve this report with the great## est possible support , as di## d the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , which approve## d my report al## most un## anim## ously . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I agree with Mr Papa## dimoulis &apos;## s report regard## ing the absolut## e necess## ity of extend## ing the Comm## un## ity action programme for the two @## -## @ year period of 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 06 in order to facilit## ate co## operation , e## special## ly cross @## -## @ border co## operation , on the exchange of expert## ise and mutual assist## ance a## mong Member State## s in this field . 
cross @## -## @ border co## operation and a co## operation culture are fundamental , be## cause the securit## y of the countries in the European Union is close## ly link## ed to what happen## s on the## ir border## s . 
to that end , we must invest heav## ily in volunteer## s . 
in add## ition , we agree on the seven area## s that need to be strength## ened , in view of the defi## ci## encies reveal## ed at the level of individual nation## s . 
the European People &apos;## s Part## y also believ## es that the Commission ought to evalu## ate the implement## ation of the current programme be## fore it end## s and prepar## e a report to be submit## ted to the European Parliament and the Council . 
I would point out that the Comm## un## ity action programme is be## ing extend## ed to the year## s 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 06 with## out Parliament having be## en s## ent the mid @## -## @ term report or the final report provid## ed for by Decision 19## 99 / 84## 7 / EC establish## ing a Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection for the period from 1 Janu## ary 20## 00 to 31 Dec## ember 20## 04 . 
to d## ate we have not even receiv## ed any just## ification for the delay . 
that is a ver## y serious fail## ing , be## cause it violate## s Parliament &apos;## s prerogative to give it## s opinion and force## s it come to a decision with## out see## ing any qualitative or quantitative inform## ation on the action## s take## n or the result## s achiev## ed . 
our con## fidence in the new Commission , how## ever , lead## s us to hope that these report## s will be forward## ed by the re## quest## ed d## ate of 30 Ju## ne 20## 06 , precise## ly for the purpose - and in the hope - of promot## ing full co## operation between the European Parliament and the Commission . 
th## ose document## s should give us an evalu## ation of the ex## tent of the Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection , together with the action## s planned under the other two on## going Comm## un## ity programme## s , which will provid## e Parliament &apos;## s Committee on the Environment with use## ful suggest## ions for inclus## ion in the s## ing## le action programme that we hope the Commission will put in place for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , happi## ly we all agree on this issue and , con## sequent## ly , I also share what ha## s be## en s## aid by pre## vi## ous speaker## s . 
we feel that it is cruc## ial to extend this action programme and we also deem it import## ant that in the two year## s concern## ed , 20## 05 and 20## 06 , the Commission can make an accurate assess## ment of the current programme and can prepar## e a new and more ambitious instrument of action , taking account of the Fina## ncial Perspective## s for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 and any need## s ident## ified in the mean## time . 
new problem## s require new solution## s . 
we also , there## fore , endorse Mr Papa## dimoulis &apos;## s report - and I compliment him on hi## s work - and we natural## ly support the Commission &apos;## s propos## al to extend the programme . 
we do feel , how## ever , that , bear## ing in mind the programme &apos;## s object## ive## s and it## s enlarge## ment to ten more countries , fund## ing should be step## ped up even further . 
the import## ance of civil protection continu## es to grow . 
person## s and proper## ty must be protect## ed and this is an area that require## s great## er resource## s . 
in re## cent year## s , as ha## s be## en point## ed out in this House , a number of natural disaster## s and criminal## ly @## -## @ motivate## d disaster## s have occur## red , which have affect## ed bo## th the people and the econom## ies of the countries concern## ed . 
s## uch was the case of the accident , the flood## s in the South of France , the terrorist attack on Madrid and the forest fire## s in Spa## in and Port## ugal . 
coming from Port## ugal as I do , I am particular## ly sensitiv## e to this issue , as you will understand . 
as I have s## aid , great## er fund## ing would be desir## able s## o that we can better prevent and reme## dy situ## ations of this nature . 
in Port## ugal al## one , for ex## ample , in 20## 03 , 4## 00## .000 hectare## s of forest we## re burn## t and approximate## ly 1## 70## .000 hectare## s in 20## 04 . 
it is there## fore essential that the next action instrument provid## es for great## er financial support . 
the environment is price## less and our forest## s can## not continu## e to dis## appear . 
we have an oblig## ation to pre## serve them s## o that we can leave them to futur## e generation## s . 
we can## not forget that the Earth does not belong to us , it ha## s be## en borrow## ed for our child## ren . 
we must there## fore step up measure## s aim## ed at prevent## ion and cure . 
as far as prevent## ion is concern## ed , there must be great## er EU involve## ment , in con## junction with national , regional and local administ## rations , a## long with technical and financial support , to prevent these disaster## s , which occur year after year . 
prevent## ion is better , and in## de## ed more effective and cheap## er , th## an cure . 
with regard to resto## rative measure## s , co## ordination and monitor## ing must be step## ped up , particular## ly in term## s of re## forest## ing the area## s affect## ed by the fire## s . 
it is worth re## member## ing that the resto## ration of the Medi## terranean forest ha## s take## n al## most a hundred year## s . 
there are sector## s in which we can## not make sav## ing## s . 
as for civil protection , making sav## ing## s might mean be## coming ir## redeem## ably poor## er and our collect## ive futur## e be## ing sever## e## ly compromis## ed . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I s## hall say straight away that I am in favour of extend## ing the Comm## un## ity action programme on civil protection by two year## s . 
to me it seem## s not s## o much a free cho## ice as a man## d## atory solution , with## out any alter## native## s . 
we have reach## ed the end of the current programme with## out a last## ing , concrete solution to the problem . 
that ver## y fact show## s just how marginal the subject of civil protection in Europe is . 
I feel I have develop## ed some modest experience in this field , as I chair the civil protection committee in Cata## nia , the province of I## ta## ly most expose## d to seismic and vol## can## ic risk , and also be## cause I co## ordinate## d the emerge## ncy measure## s for the Italia## n Govern## ment d## uring the terr## ible erupt## ion of Mo## un## t Etna in the summer of 20## 01 . 
over the year## s I have come to the conclusion that civil protection is not just an agree## able topic for a round table or a pleasant , convivial get @## -## @ together , but is a subject that is in## dis## sol## ub## ly link## ed to people &apos;## s safety and , as you know , safety is a physio## logical right be## fore it is a constitutional right . 
I believ## e I can say that the European Union is serious## ly and scandal## ously drag## ging it## s fee## t in this area . 
the subject was first address## ed on## ly f## ive year## s ago with a number of initiative## s that appear good in the## ory but in practice suffer from serious defi## ci## encies - as was point## ed out by the rapporteur him## self , who## s## e work I admir## e . 
in fact , the approach seem## s schizophrenic not on## ly at a logist## ical level but also be## cause of the in## adequate financial cover . 
Commission## er , what result## s have the inform## ation monitor## ing centre , the solid## arity fund and the Comm## un## ity mechan## ism achiev## ed in term## s of risk forecast## ing and prevent## ion , ra## ther th## an of emerge## ncy and post @## -## @ emerge## ncy manage## ment ? 
what qualitative result## s have the## y had on European Union ter## rit## ory ? 
can we find out what the## ir effect ha## s be## en ? 
can we have a detail## ed report ? 
will people understand that a disaster may not al## ways coincide with the border## s of an individual state , thu## s be## coming a supranational problem , as the oil slick from the demonst## rated ? 
how can civil protection cap## abilities in Europe be allow## ed to remain fragment## ed a## mong the area## s of respons## ibility of the environment , health , ter## rit## ory , agri## culture and internal affair## s ? 
a European civil protection age## ncy need## s to be set up , some## thing I ask## ed the Commission to do two year## s ago . 
apart from the fact that an operation## al structure can un## doubt## ed## ly increas## e involve## ment , e## special## ly in Member State## s that are less sensitiv## e to the problem , s## uch a solution would have the advantage of oper## ating above the territorial level to develop and harmon## ise procedure## s and method## s for ana## ly## s## ing and mitig## ating the risk of natural and techno## logical disaster## s , and it would establish a proper task force . 
in conclusion , I believ## e we need to promot## e the action of civil protection volunteer## s and to support it with structure## d train## ing , equip## ment and fund## s , s## o that it can become an essential resource for deal## ing with emerge## ncies and natural and other disaster## s . 
I hope that the Commission will find the strength , the will and the courage to work with Parliament in this area . 
- Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to thank the rapporteur for hi## s clear and specific comment## s on the Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection . 
hi## s propos## al## s on integrate## d manage## ment and more efficient operation of the relev## ant mechan## ism and the extens## ion of the programme , which we support , are also to the point . 
over re## cent year## s , all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experience## d disaster## s with the broad## est , direct con## sequenc## es on the live## s of a large number of our fellow men and on soci## ety and the econom## y as a whole . 
in respons## e to these even## ts , we adopt## ed the Comm## un## ity action programme . 
as we all recall , we we## re over## take## n by even## ts and react## ed after them . 
let us take proper stock today , quantitative## ly and qualitative## ly , and let us look with the experience we have acquir## ed at how we can improve the exist## ing mechan## ism in all it## s function## s and at all stag## es , from prevent## ion to combat## ing of disaster## s and the resto## ration of and return to social life . 
this relate## s bo## th to the monitor## ing mechan## ism and to the Solidar## ity Fund . 
the rapporteur propos## es better exchange of inform## ation and best practice## s , more train## ing for intervention team## s , mobil## ising volunteer## s and better co## ordination between the age## ncies involve## d at European , national , regional and local level . 
as far as increas## ing the budget is concern## ed , it is necess## ary but , at the same time , the procedure also need## s to be simpl## ified . 
I trust that the issue we are deba## ting to## night will receiv## e the assent of the Council , be## cause it is a ver## y import## ant issue . 
it not on## ly resolv## es dai## ly problem## s , but is also of major symbol## ic import## ance . 
the citizen## s feel the European Union in the## ir live## s with this sort of intervention . 
European national## ity thu## s acquir## es a specific and deep## er mean## ing . 
this sort of programme bring## s European institution## s , national and local age## ncies and local author## ities in## to direct co## operation , some## thing in which we are lagg## ing be## hind , bo## th at national level and in term## s of co## ordination between the European Union and the national age## ncies . 
to the out## side world , this sort of programme give## s the European Union vis## ibility and , more import## ant## ly , project## s an efficient and human## e face , some## thing which , listen## ing to you on the pre## vi## ous report Commission## er , you intend to make a re## ality . 
Mr President , I wish first of all to welcome the propos## al by the rapporteur , Mr Papa## dimoulis , to extend the action programme in the field of civil protection . 
coming from a country which ha## s benefit## ed in the past from EU fund## ing in order to cope with natural disaster## s , I fully appreci## ate the import## ance of the programme . 
in## de## ed , as a former minister in my own govern## ment , I visit## ed Bru## ssels in 19## 95 seek## ing assist## ance to allevi## ate the effect## s of substanti## al flood## ing through## out the length and bread## th of Ireland . 
I succeed## ed in obtain## ing consider## able financial assist## ance . 
I note the increas## e in the budget from the action programme in the field of civil protection for 20## 05 and 20## 06 but , like other speaker## s who have contribut## ed to this debate , when I examin## e the increas## e I note that it is a mer## e EUR 0.## 9 million for e## ach of the year## s 20## 05 and 20## 06 . 
I read the report in some detail and the just## ification for the increas## e is &apos; EU enlarge## ment &apos; . 
when one consider## s the fact that we are increas## ing the s## ize of our Comm## un## ity and wel## coming the access## ion of 10 new Member State## s to our Comm## un## ity , in real term## s the s## o @## -## @ call## ed increas## e is actual## ly a decreas## e ; that is with## out factor## ing in inflation . 
I would like to see an emerge## ncy fund - I know you mention## ed the Solidar## ity Fund - for civil disaster## s , where direct aid would be give## n to the region## s of the new access## ion states , in the same way as Ireland was help## ed in the past . 
these states have free## d them## selves from the iron grip of Mos## cow . 
the## y all qualify for Objective 1 status ; the## ir econom## ies are s## till large## ly embryo## nic . 
just as Ireland found it## self in civil disaster## s , these new countries will inevit## ably find them## selves in situ## ations where natural disaster## s will occur . 
I fundamental## ly believ## e that we should set a## side e## ach year a substanti## al fund to assist s## uch countries by way of direct relief aid . 
I commend the rapporteur for hi## s system## atic approach and re## commend## ations . 
he w## ent through e## ach area in detail . 
prevent## ion , where possible , is desir## able ; prepar## ed## ness is vital ; protection , emerge## ncy measure## s and recover## y are all essential . 
I believ## e the schem## e that he ha## s prepar## ed is excel## lent , but it is total## ly under## fund## ed . 
we can## not foresee earth## quake## s , flood## s or forest fire## s - the## y are natural disaster## s . 
in conclusion , 
I am not s## peak## ing S## wa## hi## li , it is my own native ton## gue , Irish , which un## fortunate## ly is the on## ly official language not include## d in the Comm## un## ity . 
a happy Christ## mas and a happy New Year to e## ach and every one of you . 
. Mr President , I have listen## ed ver## y care## fully to what ha## s be## en s## aid . 
first I wish to thank you all - the rapporteur and all the Member## s of Parliament who have spoken - for your support for this programme for civil protection , which we all feel is import## ant . 
I also thank you for your co## operation . 
in answer to the question about how will this go forward , I can tell you that there will be no problem , there will be a prolong## ation . 
Co## re## per discuss## ed the Commission propos## al on 15 Dec## ember , and it will go as an &apos; A &apos; point - that is , one where there are no problem## s - to the Environment Council be## fore Christ## mas . 
let me also say that , in the mean## time , the Commission intend## s to present a propos## al for a new legal instrument with a view to it## s ent## ry in## to force in Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
that mean## s that this new propos## al will be bas## ed on the provision## s of the new constitutional Treat## y for great## er possibil## ities to develop European co## operation in the field of civil protection ; and thu## s we will be work## ing particular## ly in the field of prevent## ion that you all mention## ed , but also in the field of respons## e . 
the next two year## s will be a transit## ional period to prepar## e in the best possible way the venue for the new Treat## y , which will include man## y of the item## s and element## s mention## ed here . 
you all s## poke about prevent## ion and near## ly all of you mention## ed the import## ance of contribut## ions of volunteer## s and also of social partner## ship and the question of financ## ing , which depend## s on the financial regulation## s . 
again , we are read## y to make the prepar## ations , and in the next few month## s the Commission will come up with a propos## al . 
I hope that my colleague Commission## er Dim## as will th## en be able to discuss this ver## y close## ly with you . 
thank you ver## y much , Commission## er . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place tomor## row at 11.## 30 a.m . 
the next item is the Commission statement on the transport of anim## al## s . 
. 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to start by express## ing my grat## itude for the opportun## ity which I have today to convey to you the Commission &apos;## s view## s on s## uch an import## ant and emotional issue . 
I understand and share the concern## s and interest of the European Parliament on s## uch an import## ant issue . 
allow me to assure you that I know full well how import## ant this issue is , not on## ly to the European Parliament , not on## ly to the European Commission , but also to our million## s of citizen## s and , of course , to farm## ers and to all the age## ncies involve## d . 
I have no doubt that the European Comm## un## ity ha## s a ver## y import## ant role to play in im## prov## ing conditio## ns under which anim## al## s can be f## ed , transport## ed and slaughter## ed . 
the need to ensu## re that anim## al wel## fare is improve## d d## uring transport as a matter of day @## -## @ to @## -## @ day re## ality and not just on the statute book is an import## ant object## ive for me . 
I have long be## en aware of the un## satisfactory way that the current legisl## ation on transport is be## ing appli## ed and of the ap## parent lack of priorit## y give## n to this area of legisl## ation by national author## ities . 
the correct and full enforce## ment of anim## al wel## fare legisl## ation is essential , as is the im## mediate improve## ment of the conditio## ns of anim## al transport . 
this is why the Commission , de## spite it## s desir## e to do more to restrict transport @## -## @ by @## -## @ road time## s and reduce stock intens## ity on vehicle## s , accept## s the preside## ncy &apos;## s step @## -## @ by @## -## @ step initiative in the Council . 
we felt it was import## ant to make the significant progress that was al## read## y with## in our grasp , ra## ther th## an to defer the whole dossier to a later in## definite d## ate . 
this , as I will point out later , is with## out prejudice - and I would like to emphasis## e this - to any improve## d futur## e solution . 
in do## ing this , we have opt## ed for much strict## er rule## s , significant## ly im## prov## ing current conditio## ns , to be appli## ed as s## oon as possible . 
the## y will cover matter## s s## uch as long @## -## @ distance transport or new , substanti## ally upgrad## ed standard## s for vehicle## s . 
these will be enforce## d in the short## est possible time with## in EU standard## s . 
I wish to point out that the vast major## ity of Parliament &apos;## s amend## ments have be## en integrate## d and in## corporate## d in## to the final text and I thank Parliament for it## s import## ant contribut## ion . 
I have no problem in admit## ting that it is un## fortunate that there was no agree## ment on the issue of restrict## ions on the travel time and the transport den## s## ity . 
there was no chance - and I have to be frank about this - of s## uch provision## s be## ing support## ed in the Council , and the fail## ure to reach agree## ment at the April 20## 04 Agri## cultural Council was a clear warn## ing . 
but fail## ure to reach agree## ment at the last Council would have mean## t an in## definite continu## ation of the exist## ing un## accept## able conditio## ns and a significant delay in the## ir improve## ment . 
this does not mean , how## ever , that the Commission does not believ## e that all possibil## ities for rein## forc## ing the provision## s on travel time should and will be exploit## ed in the futur## e . 
first## ly - and this is not the on## ly possibil## ity - the final text provid## es for the Commission to report back to the Council with## in - not after - four year## s of the d## ate of implement## ation on the issue of travel time and load## ing den## s## ities and possibly to mod## ify it## s approach on the bas## is of the experience acquir## ed from the application of the new rule## s . 
how## ever , in add## ition - and this is import## ant - regard## less of what the regulation provid## es , the Commission will care## fully analyse the situ## ation , including the prevail## ing political conditio## ns , and will avail it## self of it## s power of initiative . 
I retain## ed this right when giving our consent to the compromis## e . 
let me brief## ly list some of the improve## ments that this new regulation will introduce in the near futur## e . 
I have a list of four page## s and I will not read them all . 
be## fore I do s## o , I want to remind honour## able Member## s that the regulation states that Member State## s have the right to adopt and implement strict## er rule## s with## in the## ir ter## rit## ory th## an th## ose provid## ed for in the regulation . 
there## fore , this is a challenge for the Member State## s , and it is a challenge for you . 
if en## ough Member State## s adopt strict## er rule## s th## en the political pressure - the peer pressure - on the rest would be much more evident and effective . 
how## ever , we need the improve## ments in the exist## ing regulation . 
first## ly , a satellite navig## ation system will be us## ed on road vehicle## s from 20## 07 . 
there will be force## d vent## il## ation and temper## ature monitor## ing in## side the truck## s , with improve## ments in water facilit## ies and drink## ing facilit## ies , individual stall## s for the transport of horse## s and other conditio## ns in relation to horse## s . 
there will be strict## er conditio## ns for the train## ing of driv## ers and a ban on transport## ing pre## gnant , sick and wound## ed anim## al## s . 
there will also be administ## rative provision## s to ensu## re consist## ency between check## s by official## s in different Member State## s . 
this will app## ly to all journey## s . 
as you will be aware , the use of satellite navig## ation system## s was promot## ed by the European Parliament last month and support## ed by the Commission . 
this represent## s an innov## ative and prom## ising tool to monitor anim## al transport , and the Commission is read## y to invest im## mediate## ly in this . 
the proper use of this technology will contribut## e to the promot## ion of a more trans## parent and high @## -## @ qual## ity approach to anim## al transport in Europe , in tune with the wish## es of our citizen## s but also en## ab## ling better enforce## ment . 
this is extreme## ly import## ant . 
it is not en## ough to regulate or adopt rule## s , we must have the mean## s to enforce them and to supervise the## ir enforce## ment . 
European citizen## s have point## ed out on in## numer## able occasion## s and in man## y ways that the lack of effective enforce## ment ha## s be## en an appreci## able weak## ness of the current system . 
I fully agree with that . 
I am determine## d and commit## ted to ens## uring better enforce## ment of anim## al wel## fare rule## s and to insist## ing that Member State## s report precise## ly on the state of play of the control## s car## ried out . 
we will continu## e to press Member State## s for this inform## ation and I am pleas## ed that the new legisl## ation will allow us to do s## o in a more efficient way . 
to s## um up , we stated in the Council that the Commission reserv## es the right to respond in accord## ance with the rule## s of the Treat## y , with due regard to the wel## fare require## ments of anim## al## s . 
there## fore , the Commission will continu## e to be vigil## ant and will close## ly monitor the situ## ation on anim## al transport in Member State## s . 
we are prepar## ed to take a legisl## ative initiative at any time in the futur## e should anim## al wel## fare conditio## ns need further improve## ment . 
I would like to comment on two more issue## s . 
first , the improve## ment of anim## al wel## fare is a continu## ous process . 
it is not just a regulation , we are al## read## y work## ing on other improve## ments on poultry and on micro## climate## s with## in the transport vehicle## s . 
there## fore it is not the end , it is just the begin## ning . 
at the same time , I have look## ed at what the opt## ions we## re at the last Council meet## ing . 
the## y we## re not between the optim## um maxim## um and the compromis## e , the## y we## re between the compromis## e and continu## ing in## definite## ly with the present situ## ation , with all the un## accept## able conditio## ns that prevail at this point . 
I am certain you will understand that if one ha## s the respons## ibility of taking a decision , one ha## s to weigh the pro## s and con## s and decide in which direct## ion to go . 
I can assure you that the Commission &apos;## s on## ly concern on this issue was the wel## fare of the anim## al## s and how to make practical improve## ments as s## oon as possible . 
it was not just to insist on a principle which eventual## ly would harm the anim## al## s , be## cause it would not en## able us to improve the exist## ing conditio## ns in any way . 
I repeat , the present compromis## e significant## ly improve## s the present situ## ation with## out depriv## ing the Commission of the right to come back to these ver## y import## ant issue## s . 
believ## e me , it was a Commission propos## al . 
we would have be## en much happi## er if these provision## s we## re include## d and accept## ed in the compromis## e . 
but , un## fortunate## ly , there was no possibil## ity of s## uch an agree## ment . 
if I may , I suggest talk## ing to the vari## ous N## GO## s . 
the## y we## re not happy but the## y accept## ed this compromis## e be## cause the## y realis## ed that it is a significant step forward . 
final## ly - and I would be interest## ed to hear your comment## s as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter - I can assure you that my intention is , be## fore the end of this Commission &apos;## s term and definite## ly be## fore the end of this Parliament &apos;## s term , to come back with a new propos## al and have a new discuss## ion . 
the Commission is commit## ted to this . 
but , the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member State## s to accept this new propos## al when it come## s . 
. - Mr President , I should like to thank Commission## er Kyprianou most warm## ly for the open## ness with which he ha## s ra## ised this issue o## nce more . 
you have on## ly just assume## d your du## ties , and I think that your position at all even## ts open## s up the possibil## ity of a ver## y good futur## e work## ing relation## ship between Parliament and the Commission on this , too . 
I am say## ing this with good reason : you hit the nail on the head when you s## aid just now that the main problem regard## ing anim## al transport in Europe is the lack of priorit## y give## n to it by national author## ities . 
this is our s## tick## ing point , and reme## dy## ing it would represent tremend## ous progress . 
I should like to give an ex## ample by way of illust## ration . 
I note that , at the present time , the Austria## n govern## ment , in particular , is do## ing a good job and is exerc## ising good super## vision . 
this is result## ing in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travel## ling to I## ta## ly by rout## es other th## an Austria all of a sudden . 
this is the kind of situ## ation that arise## s when a number of other Member State## s neglect the## ir du## ties . 
in that regard , the Austria## n model should become the European model : with effective legisl## ation and effective enforce## ment . 
this is the way to put an end to all the un## pleasant debate . 
how## ever , the Council ha## s come to an agree## ment , and ha## s ma## de a correspond## ing amend## ment with## out giving prior notice to Parliament , which I find ver## y dis## concert## ing and also blame## worthy on the part of the Council . 
on the other hand , I must add that we should have be## en even wor## s## e off with## out this initiative , be## cause we can## not den## y that the agree## ment does constitut## e an improve## ment on the exist## ing legisl## ation . 
you know Parliament &apos;## s line of think## ing . 
I my## self was rapporteur on the subject of a maxim## um journey time for stock for slaughter . 
this ha## s now prov## ed un## attain## able in the Council . 
n## ever## the## less , I note that the introdu## ction of the satellite track## ing system ha## s become a re## ality , at all even## ts , and that enforce## ment of the exist## ing rule## s is to be improve## d . 
in that regard , I should like to hear how the Commission intend## s to enforce this at Member State level . 
are other instrument## s necess## ary in this regard , including on the part of Parliament ? 
I should also like to know how the Commission intend## s to support this in the con## text of im## prov## ing train## ing . 
final## ly , I note that farm @## -## @ to @## -## @ farm transport ha## s be## en liberal## ised . 
we should have like## d to see 1## 00 kilo## metre## s , but this was evident## ly un## attain## able in the Council . 
n## ever## the## less , we have take## n a small step forward . 
I should like to mention two other point## s . 
first of all , there is s## till a great deal of critic## ism of the mean## s of regulation of the transport of breed## ing stock and the rest period## s stated for this . 
anim## al## s must be transport## ed as quick## ly as possible , and introdu## c## ing the mini## mum possible number of rest period## s for the transit of breed## ing stock , too - which is under## take## n in the main in ver## y favour## able conditio## ns - would be a step forward . 
this mean## s that anim## al## s can also be transport## ed over medium distance## s . 
the same go## es for the roll @## -## @ on / roll @## -## @ off system on fer## ries . 
tell## ing Member State## s in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help . 
all this would represent an## other few step## s forward in im## prov## ing the qual## ity of anim## al transport . 
as a former rapporteur , I am a li## ttle disappoint## ed that no maxim## um journey time## s for stock for slaughter have be## en agree## d . 
n## ever## the## less , I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward . 
I am extreme## ly cur## ious to hear what propos## al## s the Commission## er intend## s to make be## fore 20## 09 for the establish## ment of a good work## ing relation## ship with Parliament , and also , in particular , for making Member State## s comp## ly with the European rule## s . 
. - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commission## er for hi## s word## s . I share hi## s disappoint## ment over the Council &apos;## s compromis## e . 
it bring## s no improve## ment in the journey time## s for anim## al transport , non## e in the rest period## s and non## e in the maxim## um stock## ing den## s## ity , and that could endur## e for year## s to come . 
I wish the Council every success in attempt## ing to explain this compromis## e to the European public . 
it is an extreme## ly bad one , including for the im## age of the whole sector , and one that is un## accept## able from an anim## al wel## fare point of view . 
I there## fore support the propos## al by my fellow Member## s to limit the maxim## um journey time to eight hour## s . 
on## ly a decision of this nature would demonst## rate that Europe is re## ally serious about sustain## able agri## culture , one of the priorit## ies of which must be anim## al wel## fare . 
Europe is built in small step## s , as we all know , and in## de## ed that is a ver## y good thing , in man## y case## s even the best way . 
whi## lst the EU is taking excess## ive## ly small step## s here to## ward## s im## prov## ing anim## al wel## fare , anim## al## s in Europe are be## ing drag## ged back and forth for thousand## s of kilo## metre## s in atro## cious conditio## ns . 
it will be nice and re## assuring for them to know that the## y are be## ing watch## ed by satellite## s all a## long . 
. 
Mr President , I agree with the Commission## er &apos;## s statement . 
this is a ver## y import## ant issue . 
I also agree that the EU ha## s play## ed an import## ant role in regard to the way that anim## al## s are f## ed , transport## ed and slaughter## ed . 
as the Commission## er stated , the EU ha## s ens## ured man## y improve## ments in anim## al wel## fare d## uring transport## ation . 
some of them have be## en mention## ed al## read## y : propos## al## s for satellite track## ing system## s , vent## il## ation and temper## ature monitor## ing , strict## er conditio## ns for d## river train## ing and a great## er number of official inspect## ions in different countries . 
progress ha## s be## en ma## de . 
I also want to nail my colour## s to the mast be## cause I am an MEP who represent## s a constitue## ncy that is bo## th r## ural and urban . 
agri## culture continu## es to play a ver## y import## ant economic role in the north and west of Ireland . 
in## de## ed , the agri## culture business ha## s for man## y year## s be## en well support## ed by the EU . 
live anim## al export## s are a huge## ly import## ant , legitimate business for Ireland . 
we export 90 % of our anim## al## s and about 10 % of th## ose , or 200 000 live ca## ttle , are export## ed every year to market## s in France , I## ta## ly , Spa## in and the N## ether## land## s . 
this trade is worth over EUR 1## 50 million annual## ly . 
there## fore , a vibr## ant export trade is essential for Irish agri## culture and for the entire live## stock sector . 
I believ## e we must have access to the s## ing## le market . 
there is an import## ant market for Irish wean## ling## s in Europe and I believ## e this market should not be hinder## ed . 
s## ure## ly , free access to the market is one of the corner## stone## s of EU policy . 
we also need to balance anim## al wel## fare with market access and support for agri## culture , not just in Ireland , but also in the EU as a whole . 
again , I agree with the Commission## er . 
we need enforce## ment and no one ha## s a problem with that - consum## ers or farm## ers , it is in all our interest## s . 
an## other issue regard## ing live export is that the trade provid## es competit## ion in Ireland . 
this is an## other corner## stone of EU policy . 
I believ## e we have ma## de progress ; there is prob## ably further to go , but the Commission is do## ing use## ful work . 
Mr President , I took the initiative regard## ing this extra debate follow## ing the Council decision in N## ov## ember . 
a number of technical improve## ments we## re at the cost of up to six year## s &quot; block## ing of the issue of protect## ing our anim## al## s . 
this would mean that , through## out the## ir period## s of office , n## either Parliament nor the Commission would be give## n an opportun## ity to improve the conditio## ns of anim## al## s , a state of affair## s that is quit## e un## reason## able . 
the Council decision depart## ed s## o complete## ly from the propos## al that I even doubt## ed it## s legal## ity . 
Mr Kyprianou , I hope you realis## e your ambit## ion of coming back with den## s## ity figure## s and transport time## s as s## oon as possible . 
I also hope that you make use of the Treat## y &apos;## s article## s concern## ing transport , consum## er issue## s or health as a legal bas## is s## o that Parliament can particip## ate through the co## decision procedure . 
we could th## en together break the Council &apos;## s resist## ance to provid## ing anim## al## s with reason## able conditio## ns . 
un## fortunate## ly , the Council listen## s more to lobby## ists th## an to opinion . 
the matu## rity of a soci## ety is show## n by the way in which it treat## s th## ose who are defence## less . 
if the rule## s govern## ing the transport of anim## al## s are an indic## ator of Europe &apos;## s matu## rity , we are un## fortunate## ly s## till barbar## ians . 
I invit## e all minister## s to travel , together with my## self , between Stock## holm and Bru## ssels under the conditio## ns that app## ly to the transport of anim## al## s . 
the## y might th## en understand what the## y have done . 
if we are regard## ed as 75 @## -## @ kilo sheep , there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed . 
if we are regard## ed as chicken## s , we s## hall see how fa## e## ce## s from th## ose above fall down onto th## ose be## low . 
if we are regard## ed as pig## s , we s## hall , in accord## ance with the Council decision , be give## n nothing less th## an electric shock## s if we re## fuse to move . 
we s## hall also be give## n water on## ly after 14 hour## s be## fore continu## ing for an## other 14 hour## s . 
we must also try to ensu## re that , in accord## ance with the Council rule## s , the temper## ature is kept above f## ive degree## s Ce## nti## grade d## uring the journey . 
Mr President , Commission## er , if we are to believ## e what the Council say## s about this European Union of our## s want## ing to encourag## e sustain## able development , and if we look at the re## ality of where this could be done and the way in which the Council go## es about do## ing it in practice , we see that the Member State## s re## ally can## not summon up the will to do it . 
y## et again , anim## al## s have lo## st out when there is a cho## ice to be ma## de between protect## ing them or the profit## s of the firm## s that fatt## en them up . 
I will non## e## the## less con## cede that the Commission ha## s ma## de an ef## fort , and I will not den## y that a number of change## s have be## en ma## de for the better , but the under## ly## ing principle ha## s remain## ed the same as it was be## fore . 
there are th## ose of you in the Council who have decide## d not to have a limit on transport time## s for anim## al## s and that the permit## ted den## s## ity should not be spec## ified , and I am absolut## e## ly convince## d that you would be quick to introduce other rule## s if your domestic pet## s we## re to be transport## ed the length and bread## th of Europe . 
if we want to defend the right to life and the right## s of anim## al## s , th## en we need to approach this from a different angle . 
the introdu## ction of the G## SP satellite navig## ation system does , of course , achiev## e some## thing ; it mean## s that check## s can be better car## ried out . 
there is no disput## ing that . 
like## wise , if it is ens## ured that the anim## al## s are give## n water and improve## d vent## il## ation , that is of course a small advance , but it does not solv## e the problem . 
if you want regional development , this is a real opportun## ity to demonst## rate it , for you can ra## ise anim## al## s , fatt## en them up , and process them on the spot or with## in the local area with## out having to organise these transport## s from one end of the European Union to the other . 
I re## ally can## not understand how Mr Maat can describ## e this as tremend## ous progress . 
I can## not see it as s## uch . 
it patch## es thing## s up , with## out do## ing any## thing to deal with the main problem## s and re## move the main cause## s of the torment these anim## al## s under## go . 
Mr President , I am a sever## e critic of the damage the EU ha## s done to Brit## ain and a passionate advoc## ate of Brit## ain &apos;## s withdraw## al from it . 
the European Union destroy## s job## s - as Ton## y Blair s## aid in hi## s 19## 83 elect## ion address . 
it ha## s also pass## ed legisl## ation that ha## s led to the closure of hundred## s of local abattoir## s . 
how## ever , this tooth## less Parliament pass## es re## solution## s that are th## en ignor## ed by bo## th the Council and the Commission . 
the decision## s ma## de by this Parliament on the transport## ation of anim## al## s have be## en repeat## ed## ly ignor## ed and horrendous suffer## ing continu## es . 
over 3 million anim## al## s every year endur## e journey## s last## ing 30 hour## s or more in un## accept## able conditio## ns and man## y di## e in transit . 
we## re this not bad en## ough , even more suffer## ing is now be## ing planned by the European Union under the REACH Direct## ive , and we will see million## s more anim## al## s mov## ed a## round for live test## ing . 
to th## ose in the out## side world - the real world - who are as appal## led as I am by all this , I have a simpl## e mess## age . 
I wish the European Union would interfere and legisl## ate less , for if the European Union is the answer it must s## ure## ly have be## en a ver## y stupid question . 
Mr President , the wel## fare of anim## al## s d## uring transit ha## s be## en a matter of continu## ing concern for Parliament over re## cent year## s . 
I venture to suggest it ha## s give## n rise to more concern th## an the p## light of the million## s of child## ren dy## ing of starv## ation or liv## ing in un## accept## able conditio## ns in contempor## ary Europe . 
if the human## itarian organisation## s acting in the interest## s of th## ose individual## s had show## n the same de## termination as the## ir counter## part## s promot## ing the cause of anim## al## s , some## thing could prob## ably have be## en done to help the European child## ren dy## ing day after day . 
I s## hall be more specific . 
Parliament ha## s issu## ed two opinion## s on anim## al wel## fare in transit over the last three year## s . 
I do not believ## e it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter , as fortunate## ly it was final## ly settle## d this N## ov## ember , follow## ing the agree## ment reach## ed in the Council of Minister## s of the European Union . 
in my view , the compromis## e propos## al table## d by the Irish Presidency was better . 
it contain## ed a reason## able restrict## ion on journey time## s , taking account of bo## th the anim## al wel## fare and the question of free## dom of move## ment of good## s with## in the European Union . 
I would remind the House of the time## s in question , name## ly nine hour## s of journey time p## lus twelve for rest and a further nine hour## s of journey time . 
the agree## ment reach## ed today under the Dutch Presidency does not imp## ly any change to exist## ing regulation## s on journey time . 
the decision on this cruc## ial issue in the debate ha## s be## en postpone## d for six year## s . 
the postpone## ment is due to the differ## ence## s of opinion that s## till exist between the Member State## s . 
it amount## s to s## tale## mate . 
non## e## the## less , I would like to clar## ify one aspect I feel man## y of th## ose follow## ing the debate## s have over## look## ed , and which should be br## ought to the notice of the citizen## s . 
exist## ing regulation## s al## read## y impose a maxim## um travel time of eight hour## s when vehicle## s that do not comp## ly with the wel## fare standard## s laid down in the regulation## s are us## ed . 
in add## ition , these standard## s have be## en tighten## ed up by virtue of the agree## ment reach## ed in the Council of Minister## s . 
Mr President , I can understand why the Commission ha## s gone a## long with this solution , be## cause it is a pragmat## ic one . 
the Council was not going to agree to any## thing more at this s## tage . 
how## ever , it is extreme## ly disappoint## ing - as every## one ha## s s## aid - that we could not get some## thing on journey time## s , one of the key issue## s ; or on stock## ing den## s## ities . 
Member State## s can adopt tough## er legisl## ation . 
we in this Parliament want a big## ger say on these issue## s , but at the moment we do not have it . 
I will certain## ly press my own govern## ment to go further on this . 
I am pleas## ed , Commission## er , that you mention## ed enforce## ment . 
that is one area where this legisl## ation ha## s fall## en down in the past . 
you will be aware of the N## GO## s that have give## n us video evidence of how this legisl## ation ha## s be## en by @## -## @ pass## ed and ignor## ed . 
you s## aid that in four year## s you are going to come back with more legisl## ation . 
I hope that you do . 
I hope you will keep Parliament inform## ed of what happen## s in the inter## im . 
we want to hear about what is happen## ing with regard to reinforce## d monitor## ing . 
I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legisl## ation . 
we al## read## y have a written decla## ration on journey time## s . 
I am s## ure that our commit## ment will remain the same . 
Mr President , anim## al protection should be mov## ed im## mediate## ly from the agri## cultural head## ing and from Article 37 . 
it could , of course , be transfer## red to health and consum## er protection be## cause it would th## en be Commission## er Kyprianou who would be respons## ible for the matter , which sound## s more re## assuring . 
in Den## mark , it is the Just## ice Mini## s## try that is respons## ible for this matter . 
we regard anim## al protection as legal protection , but Article 37 is exclus## ive## ly about increas## ing production and earn## ing## s . 
the poor anim## al## s must suffer heav## en know## s what kind of mistreat## ment when protection it## self is subject to gre## ed . 
it is actual## ly gro## te## s## que that export subsid## ies are paid when horse## s , cow## s and sheep have to be s## ent out of the EU . 
anim## al## s that are to be slaughter## ed should on## ly be d## riven to the near## est abattoir and for a maxim## um of eight hour## s . 
we have a major## ity in favour of this view in Den## mark . 
anim## al## s that are not to be slaughter## ed should on## ly be transport## ed for eight hour## s with## out rest , food and a change of air , and the accommo## d## ation must be in order . 
that is also some## thing favour## ed by a major## ity in Den## mark . 
of course , the pre## vi## ous Parliament stated this too , and it ha## s to be ask## ed why the Commission di## d not go to the Council and insist on these conditio## ns be## ing respect## ed . 
when we obtain the new Constitution , Parliament will have the right of co## decision and , if anim## al protection had no long## er be## en subject to Article 37 , Parliament would now al## read## y have had this right . 
regard## ing an## other matter - name## ly trans## par## ency - our Ombuds## man express## ly stated that the provision## s of the new Constitution could proper## ly be us## ed when there was s## uch large support for do## ing s## o , s## o there is a double opportun## ity for involv## ing Parliament in this procedure right now . 
what ha## s happen## ed is that a strate## gy ha## s be## en cho## s## en where## by a decision ha## s be## en hurried through , al## most as if it we## re a question of keeping bo## th people and Parliament remote from the decision @## -## @ making concern## ed over the next six year## s . 
we , in## de## ed I , have not## ed that the Member State## s must implement decision## s that go further .## .. 
- Mr President , the problem at issue is of a cross @## -## @ border nature and can## not be solv## ed by national legisl## ation al## one . 
for this reason , it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament . 
for year## s , Parliament ha## s be## en in## un## d## ated with petition## s from people right## ly call## ing for attention to abuse## s in anim## al transport . 
this appli## es in particular to horse## s that come to the end of the## ir use## ful life in the East but are desti## ned to be slaughter## ed and eat## en in the South . 
man## y anim## al## s spend a ver## y long time in transit in lor## ries , with li## ttle to eat or drink , foul them## selves , start to panic and suffer injur## y . 
the on## ly way to prevent this is to drastic## ally reduce the distance and time permit## ted for the transport of live anim## al## s . 
at the start of 20## 04 , the disput## e in this Parliament was a question of eight hour## s ver## s## us nine hour## s of continu## ous transport and of limit## ed , cheap protect## ive measure## s ver## s## us further @## -## @ reach## ing , more expensive measure## s . 
at that time , Parliament ma## de a ver## y moderate cho## ice , but even that w## ent too far for the govern## ments of a number of Member State## s . 
as a result , there is s## till s## cope for allow## ing th## ose abuse## s to continu## e . 
the key question is whet## her we accept this un## necess## ary anim## al suffer## ing in anticip## ation of a result## ing reduction in the cost## s of the live## stock trade and of road transport comp## an## ies , or whet## her we consider this suffer## ing to be complete## ly at vari## ance with our civil## isation and our respons## ibility for the wel## fare of our fellow creat## ures . 
my cho## ice is emphatic## ally in favour of civil## isation and respons## ibility . 
what the Commission## er is now an## nounc## ing is the fail## ure of decision making in the European Union . 
we have show## n our## selves to be un## able to do what is ur## gent## ly need## ed . 
national economic interest## s are taking precede## nce over our share## d civil## isation and respons## ibility . 
listen## ing to Commission## er Kyprianou s## peak , I have no doubt as to hi## s good intention## s . 
I support hi## s announce## ment of new initiative## s by the European Commission . 
I also agree with hi## s view that it would be better to start quick## ly on the bas## is of a woe## fully in## adequate result th## an of no result at all . 
satellite monitor## ing is cold comfort for the anim## al## s . 
let us not trust s## ole## ly in new technologies , but ra## ther build on the political will to genuine## ly eliminate this abuse . 
that is what is import## ant . 
I hope that we are able to achiev## e real result## s by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission , be## cause what is current## ly taking place is an absolut## e dis## grace . 
Mr President , the transport of anim## al## s with## in the EU and from the EU to countries out## side it ha## s on quit## e a few occasion## s be## en comprehens## ive## ly criticise## d . 
most re## cent## ly , we have receiv## ed inform## ation about the dis## graceful conditio## ns under which anim## al## s have be## en export## ed from the EU to Lebanon . 
that worri## es us . 
will the Commission priorit## ise this problem ? 
we hope s## o , but are not complete## ly convince## d . 
an## other matter that give## s rise to concern is the report## s on financial fraud issu## ed by OLAF at regular inter## val## s . 
re## cent## ly , these concern## ed complain## ts re## l## ating to financial fraud in connect## ion with the transport of anim## al## s to Lebanon . 
in pur## e## ly financial term## s , subsid## ies for the export of anim## al## s from the EU to thir## d countries total approximate## ly SE## K 60 @## -## @ 1## 00 million per year . 
does this amount to proper## ly us## ed tax re## venue ? 
we hope that the Commission will take anim## al protection serious## ly and that we do not have to read further report## s concern## ing misuse## d export subsid## ies . 
Mr President , I thank the Commission for ra## ising this import## ant issue for anim## al## s and human## s . 
there is a fail## ure of implement## ation , not a fail## ure of regulation . 
in fact , in man## y case## s we have over @## -## @ regulation but also non @## -## @ implement## ation . 
this ha## s led to problem## s for farm## ers and th## ose engage## d in what is a ver## y legitimate trade . 
one of my Irish colleague## s ha## s mention## ed the import## ance of this trade for Irish farm## ers . 
the new agri## culture support system urge## s farm## ers to opt for market @## -## @ led farm## ing . 
there is a legitimate market in main## land Europe for young ca## ttle from Irish farm## s . 
are we going to tell farm## ers that the## y can## not engage in this legitimate trade ? 
I do not think we can , be## cause it is vital for the success of Irish farm## ers . 
how## ever , anim## al wel## fare must of course also be a priorit## y . 
one colleague ra## ised concern## s about Lebanon . 
Irish ca## ttle go to Lebanon . 
again , it is a case of implement## ing the regulation## s that are there . 
if we stop that trade , anim## al## s will s## till move to Lebanon , per## hap## s from Australia and other area## s . 
if our concern## s are for anim## al## s , we must have concern## s for anim## al## s a## cross the world and not just European anim## al## s . 
as for re## duc## ing journey time## s and stock## ing den## s## ities , I urge that we be guide## d by science and not e## motion , be## cause this debate ha## s be## en too much guide## d by e## motion . 
I wish to refer you to in## dependent research car## ried out in Ireland on the transport of anim## al## s from Ireland to Spa## in . 
I s## hall read one paragraph from the report : &apos; the stu## dy conclude## d that transport had no advers## e effect on anim## al wel## fare bas## ed on the physio## logical , immun## o## logical and haemat## o## logical measure## ments ma## de &apos; . 
final## ly , I would just support Mr## s Herr## anz Gar## c## ia , who s## poke of human wel## fare concern## s in this House last night . 
I ra## ised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starv## ing . 
the issue## s are not link## ed , but we need to put our priorit## ies right . 
Mr## President , I too would like to warm## ly welcome the political agree## ment to be present## ed to the Agri## culture Council for formal approval next week . 
I believ## e this agree## ment ha## s one ver## y posit## ive aspect . 
it postpone## s the most controversial issue## s until 20## 11 . 
I refer to the issue## s instrument## al in the fail## ure of negoti## ations last April , name## ly journey time## s and stock## ing den## s## ities . 
some of the honour## able Member## s present today will recall the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Maat . 
it emerge## d th## en that , as Mr## s Mc## Guinness just stated , there is no solid scientific bas## is regard## ing the two issue## s of journey time and den## s## ity . 
in add## ition , large## r Member State## s and the peripheral one## s we## re serious## ly penal## ised . 
all this economic back## ground was present## ed as an anim## al wel## fare issue , as if Member## s from large and peripheral countries we## re not concern## ed about anim## al wel## fare . 
Commission## er , I believ## e the political agree## ment make## s good man## y of the short## coming## s ident## ified in current provision## s . 
this is it## s most posit## ive aspect . 
it improve## s control system## s , it introduce## s techno## logical feature## s facilit## ating control , it provid## es for a clear and trans## parent system of registr## ation and it improve## s system## s of co## operation between Member State## s . 
in add## ition , it spell## s out the du## ty of setting up train## ing system## s that will also improve the transport of anim## al## s . 
I particular## ly welcome Article 32 , be## cause it lay## s down clear## ly the bas## is for futur## e review## s of these provision## s . 
for all these reason## s , there## fore , I am bound to congratul## ate the Council for mov## ing the issue forward , and I look forward to success## ful implement## ation of the new text . 
Mr President , the Commission## er s## poke of the emot## ions that are present in this House . 
that this should be s## o certain## ly ha## s to do with the subject matter , but also with the fact that what we are deal## ing with here is a n## ever @## -## @ end## ing story . 
this is not the first time , not the second , and not even the thir## d , but per## hap## s the umpteen## th time that we have had to give this our attention . 
for well over ten year## s , we have s## ought to make improve## ments in this area , and there ha## s al## ways be## en talk of progress , but the cruc## ial progress ha## s not material## ised . 
we will , I believ## e , achiev## e a real break## through on## ly when this House acquir## es the right of co## decision in agri## cultural matter## s as well . 
I believ## e we are more like## ly to get that th## an the satellite navig## ation system . 
it is there that I have great## er con## fidence in our ability to get our way . 
turn## ing to the matter in hand , I would like to say that this is , of course , also about transport time## s , but what is of the es## s## ence is whet## her the conditio## ns are right , that is , whet## her the anim## al## s are cart## ed off in torment or whet## her the## y travel as our fellow @## -## @ creat## ures . 
if some## one go## es to the Middle East and buy## s an Arab## ian stall## ion for stu## d purpose## s , the## y do not need to worry that it will arriv## e here in a poor conditio## n . 
like## wise , if our anim## al## s travel to the Olymp## ic Game## s , the## y will arriv## e in a fit and proper state . 
it follow## s that it is the conditio## ns that matter . 
what matter## s , I think , is that we should comp## ly with what the consum## ers want . 
in Germa## ny , we have set up programme## s for qual## ity meat in which transport time is a## mong the qual## ity crite## ria . 
organ## ic farm## ing is an## other ex## ample , with the near## est slaughter## house be## ing the one that is us## ed . 
where that is a measure of qual## ity , it will also become accept## ed practice . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , terr## ible thing## s occur d## uring the transport of anim## al## s . 
anim## al## s suffer from human call## ous## ness and thought## less## ness , and im## prov## ing the## ir f## ate is a challenge to our human## ity . 
it is not mer## e## ly sensitiv## ity to the harm done to anim## al## s that make## s action necess## ary , but also the aware## ness that it is on## ly a small step from cruel## ty to anim## al## s to cruel## ty to human## s . 
the regulation under discuss## ion move## s in the right direct## ion . 
it introduce## s high## er standard## s for the protection of anim## al## s in transport , al## though these standard## s are s## till in## adequate , and it lead## s one to hope that anim## al## s will suffer less . 
as an MEP who## s## e vot## ers include Pol## ish farm## ers , I am de## light## ed at this . 
in Pol## ish fami## ly @## -## @ own## ed farm## s , which are main## ly small , anim## al## s are treat## ed with great affect## ion , and even as individual## s . 
it break## s farm## ers &quot; heart## s when the anim## al## s the## y car## ed for are treat## ed brutal## ly after be## ing sold . 
the regulation we are discuss## ing will bring progress , but it is not a solution to the problem . 
legal regulation## s must be accompani## ed by effective implement## ation , which can be fraught with difficult## y . 
Po## land , for ex## ample , is a large transit country and it experience## s problem## s with the transport of horse## s . 
legal standard## s have be## en put in place , but the monitor## ing bodies , police and vet## er## in## ary inspector## s are often help## less when fac## ed with the problem of what to do with illegal transport## s , carry## ing injur## ed anim## al## s for in## stance . 
there is a need for a network of stop## over point## s where transport## ed anim## al## s could be provid## ed with food and drink or give## n necess## ary vet## er## in## ary care . 
in ur## gent case## s , the anim## al## s could be put down at these point## s if necess## ary . 
the European Union should provid## e financial support for the setting up of s## uch a network , and Po## land at any rate require## s s## uch assist## ance . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , a genuine break## through in the transport of anim## al## s will on## ly come about when long @## -## @ distance transport## s are fully abolish## ed . 
anim## al## s should be slaughter## ed close to where the## y have be## en br## ed . 
human## itarian consider## ations are not the s## ole reason for this . 
sanit## ary consider## ations are also at issue . 
I would remind you that as show## n by the re## cent report of the Court of Audit## ors , control is practical## ly lo## st over anim## al## s transport## ed a## broad . 
lad## ies and gentle## men .## .. 
Mr President , there is no doubt that this is an area that make## s a big impress## ion upon the European population . 
last year al## one , one anim## al protection organisation collect## ed 500## .000 sign## ature## s in Den## mark , that is to say half a million sign## ature## s in a country with on## ly just over f## ive million inhabit## ants . 
all the more reason for critic## ising the way in which this propos## al ha## s be## en hurried through . 
as a Member of the European Parliament , I could not obtain access to the propos## al until a few hour## s be## fore it was in actual fact adopt## ed . 
it might well actual## ly have be## en the case , Commission## er , that if there had be## en a li## ttle more time in which to debate this issue and if there had be## en a public debate surround## ing it in the individual countries of Europe , the minister## s would have be## en ra## ther more a## men## able . 
I actual## ly think you should be serious about the statement## s you have ma## de in this House today . 
I think you should have the matter put on the age## nda again as quick## ly as possible s## o that we can have a public debate and s## o that the politic## ians and minister## s can be put under pressure . 
the big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market . 
the internal market is of course a splendid and commend## able thing but , o## nce in a while , we must also pause and bear some ethical consider## ations in mind . 
we are now treat## ing anim## al## s as if the## y we## re commodit## ies . 
anim## al## s are not commodit## ies . 
anim## al## s are liv## ing be## ing## s and must , of course , be treat## ed as s## uch . 
I would also question whet## her the propos## al that ha## s now un## fortunate## ly become legisl## ation is at all ten## able in pur## e## ly legal term## s . 
in pur## e## ly legal term## s , can there be any defence of Parliament &apos;## s be## ing depriv## ed of influence , as it ha## s be## en ? 
when this legisl## ation is revise## d , or in other word## s re @## -## @ examin## ed , it will be possible to bypass Parliament . 
as I see it , that al## one is a good en## ough reason for investig## ating whet## her this decision is at all sustain## able in legal term## s . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the pre## vi## ous speaker mention## ed the internal market , but the internal market must be judge## d by whet## her or not it operate## s in a human## e way , and by what it## s effect## s are not on## ly on human be## ing## s but also on other creat## ures . 
where anim## al transport## s are concern## ed , the issue is clear : whom does it benefit when anim## al## s are transport## ed over long distance## s ? 
it is to the benefit of mass live## stock farm## ing , a form of live## stock farm## ing that will get Europe no## where . 
what we need is not just the right measure## s , but also string## ent check## s , and this is where the att## itude of the Member State## s can## not be describ## ed as any## thing other th## an tru## ly shame## ful . 
if we are to have these check## s , we need an infra## structure , and this infra## structure also mean## s rest## ing point## s , for which we must make provision , and load## ing station## s where vehicle## s must be oblig## ed to dock when the provision## s on the protection of anim## al## s in transit are breach## ed . 
that must be enforce## d , and we - this House and the Commission - must together require the Member State## s , o## nce and for all , to implement in practice a new strate## gy for agri## culture . 
Mr President , I think Commission## er Kyprianou ha## s a difficult task in front of him in try## ing to persuade us that the N## ov## ember Council compromis## e is a genuine## ly posit## ive step forward when it come## s to live anim## al export## s . 
we know it is not , and I think you know it is not , Commission## er . 
it is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account . 
I have to say as well that I am disappoint## ed that my own govern## ment vot## ed in favour of this shab## by deal ; be## cause a few technical improve## ments are now complete## ly over## shadow## ed by the fail## ure to make any progress on journey time## s and stock## ing den## s## ity . 
as a result , it seem## s this shock## ing## ly cruel practice will continu## e for man## y year## s to come . 
I notice , how## ever , that you explic## it## ly reserv## e the right to bring forward better propos## al## s . 
I welcome that , and strong## ly urge you to do it as s## oon as possible , and in particular to introduce a maxim## um eight @## -## @ hour journey time for bo## th slaughter and further fatt## ening anim## al## s . 
you can be s## ure that Parliament will be an ally on this , even more s## o if we have co## decision . 
it is cruc## ial that we s## end out a strong signal to all Member State govern## ments that support for live export## s is un## accept## able in a civil## ised soci## ety . 
. 
Mr President , I have not## ed with great interest the view## s express## ed by Member## s . 
I share most of your concern## s and most of your view## s . 
how## ever , as I have al## read## y s## aid , the Commission felt that there was a need for im## mediate action . 
some of you s## aid that this compromis## e ha## s be## en rush## ed through . 
but at the same time , some of you s## aid that this ha## s be## en pend## ing for more th## an ten year## s . 
I believ## e , there## fore , that we had an oblig## ation to find a solution as s## oon as possible , with## out just say## ing that we would not continu## e these ef## fort## s for improve## ment . 
it is tru## e that Member State## s can do more . 
the## y can adopt strict## er rule## s , not just for anim## al## s origin## ating from the## ir ter## rit## ory but also for transit anim## al## s . 
s## o there could be , through this , a possibil## ity of strict## er regulation## s cover## ing a much wide## r area and affect## ing much more transport . 
as far as the subsid## ies are concern## ed I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right - be## cause of vari## ous international agree## ments - to legisl## ate on move## ment of anim## al## s out## side the ter## rit## ory , n## ever## the## less the European Union ha## s link## ed the export subsid## ies to anim## al wel## fare require## ments d## uring transport . 
there## fore to link the two is a substanti## al step as it bring## s compliance to a great ex## tent , even though not through im## mediate legisl## ation . 
I agree that implement## ation is ver## y import## ant . 
we will put great## er emphasis on the issue of travel time## s , including all the other improve## ments that need to be ma## de . 
we will gather en## ough scientific evidence to be able to convince even th## ose who are reluctant at this s## tage . 
there## fore we will continu## e to monitor the situ## ation and get this evidence that can be us## ed in a futur## e propos## al . 
on the stag## ing point , this regulation ha## s increas## ed bo## th the wel## fare situ## ation and the bio @## -## @ securit## y situ## ation . 
even though I understand and share the disappoint## ment of man## y of you with regard to this regulation , at the same time , we must not , through this emotional approach , dis## regard significant improve## ments that have be## en ma## de to the regulation . 
travel time## s are ver## y import## ant - that is why the## y we## re include## d in the Commission propos## al ; but conditio## ns d## uring travel are just as import## ant . 
the## y are be## ing improve## d and deal## t with in the regulation . 
the Commission examin## ed the legal problem## s refer## red to in the way in which the decision was take## n . 
I can assure you that we check## ed with the legal service## s and every## thing was done in a proper legal way . 
while I share your concern## s , we feel that this was a good compromis## e . 
it ha## s gone the right way . 
some of us might have want## ed to go one step further , or take one step less , but it is n## ever## the## less going in the right direct## ion . 
the Commission will continu## e to monitor and follow the implement## ation . implement## ation is in the hand## s of the Member State## s . 
agree## ment on any futur## e propos## al coming from the Commission will again , in the final ana## lysis , be in the hand## s of the Member State## s . 
there## fore it is some## thing on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together . 
the debate is closed . 
the next item is the report by Sérgio Ribeiro ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 37 / 20## 04 ) , on be## half of the Committee on Fish## eries , on the propos## al for a Council regulation amend## ing Regul## ation ( EC ) No 8## 50 / 98 as regard## s the protection of deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s from the effect## s of trawl## ing in certain area## s of the Atlantic Ocean ( COM ( 20## 04 ) 00## 58 - C## 5 - 00## 74 / 20## 04 - 20## 04 / 00## 20 ( CN## S ) ) . 
. 
Mr President , I thank Mr Ribeiro for hi## s report on the propos## al to protect deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s from the effect## s of trawl## ing in certain area## s of the Atlantic Ocean . 
this is the first time I have address## ed the plen## ary of this Parliament and it is satisf## y## ing that the first propos## al that I am deal## ing with is focus## ed upon the protection of deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s - an issue of great import## ance to us all . 
doubt## less , we will have man## y an occasion in futur## e , bo## th with## in this plen## ary and with## in the Committee on Fish## eries , to discuss issue## s not on## ly re## l## ating to conserv## ation and the pre## serv## ation of fish stock## s but also re## l## ating to issue## s s## uch as deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s . 
having stu## died the scientific evidence and consider## ing the irrevers## ible damage that certain fish## ing gear can cause to these un## ique habitat## s , we propos## e in this regulation to ban the use of bottom trawl## s and similar trawl gear in the area## s concern## ed . 
with this propos## al , we ful## fil the commit## ment give## n at the Fish## eries Council of 23 October 20## 03 , when the new &apos; western water## s &apos; regulation was approve## d to ensu## re protection for these habitat## s . 
I am happy to note that the rapporteur re## commend## s that Parliament approve these measure## s , as does the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety in it## s opinion . 
the Commission welcome## s the adopt## ion of measure## s to minimis## e the impact of fish## ing on marine eco## system## s . 
the## y show our de## termination to work for the integration of environment## al concern## s in the common fisher## ies policy , as envi## s## aged in the reform of 20## 02 , and as repeat## ed## ly call## ed for by public opinion . 
I turn brief## ly to the amend## ments propos## ed in the report be## fore us . 
I can accept Amendment## s No## s 1 , 2 and 3 . 
how## ever , I have difficult## y in accept## ing Amendment No 4 , since it is not in line with the legisl## ation on the mandate that is give## n to regional advis## ory council## s . 
these council## s are to be consult## ed on the development of propos## al## s for legisl## ation , but consult## ation of them is not envi## s## aged on the implement## ation of s## uch legisl## ation . 
as for Amendment No 5 , the Commission ha## s difficult## y accept## ing the sub## stance of this amend## ment as it is current## ly word## ed . 
the Commission is bound to review all propos## al## s in the light of new scientific evidence . 
hence , oblig## ing the Commission to do s## o in a specific time## frame could also work again## st the spirit and purpose of the propos## al . 
further## more , we need to be conscious of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is ver## y much dependent on the Member State## s and , there## fore , the Commission is not in a position to guarantee it## s avail## ability as prescribe## d in the amend## ment , that is , with## in a spec## ified time## frame . 
on Amendment No 6 , the Commission note## s that while it could find s## uch an amend## ment accept## able , it is not re## ally necess## ary since the geo## graphic## al application of the regulation is well known and al## read## y establish## ed . 
as for Amendment No 7 , in accord## ance with scientific ad## vice , the main threat to the ver## y fr## agile deep @## -## @ water habitat## s is bottom trawl## ing . 
damage cause## d by other gear , in particular specific gear s## uch as gill## net## s and long## line## s , may be real , but is ver## y minor compar## ed to the ero## s## ion effect## s of trawl## s . 
further## more , extend## ing the prohibition on trawl## ing through## out the European economic zone would appear to be excess## ive , i.e## . would appear not to be proportion## ate since the major## ity of this area does not have sub## marine feature## s threaten## ed by fish## ing . 
in these circum## stance## s , the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7 . 
final## ly , the Commission ha## s difficult## y accept## ing Amendment No 8 , be## cause it would creat## e a duplic## ation of ef## fort . 
comprehens## ive re## vision## s of the status of deep @## -## @ water feature## s are current## ly be## ing car## ried out by the Inter## national Council for the Expl## oit## ation of the Sea , IC## ES . 
this is consider## ed to be sufficient . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , the process of draw## ing up , discuss## ing and vot## ing on this report in committee was quit## e a surprising learn## ing process , show## ing that it is n## ever too late to learn and to carry on learn## ing . 
I tackle## d an activity with which I was on## ly superficial## ly familiar and , in particular , I supplement## ed all the theoretical knowledge that document## s and stu## dy## ing could provid## e . 
by contact## ing and receiv## ing inform## ation from th## ose connect## ed with the activity , th## ose who make it the## ir difficult live## lihood , th## ose who stu## dy it thorough## ly and serious## ly and th## ose who have respons## ibil## ities with## in it , I learn## t a lot and I know that there is s## till a lot to learn . 
I start## ed with the idea that we need to protect the environment , which is subject to attack## s that are like## ly to get wor## s## e , and I found three question## s taking shape : which predator## y activities should be moderate## d or ban## ned ? 
with## in what limit## s ? 
under what jurisdiction ? 
after much listen## ing and consider## able thought , I be## came convince## d that a ban on bottom trawl## ing would not be en## ough to protect coral re## ef## s and other formation## s , a## mong which I would high## light ther## mal vent## s . 
it was prov## ed to me that bottom gill @## -## @ nett## ing was equal## ly predator## y or even more s## o . 
that is why I explic## it## ly include## d it . 
why is there s## uch resist## ance to it## s inclus## ion ? 
is it be## cause power## ful interest## s use that method ? 
the Commission argue## s that it is be## cause there is in## sufficient scientific evidence to prove the evil## s of the technique . 
even if that we## re s## o , how## ever , the pre## caution## ary principle should app## ly . 
the delimit## ation of the area## s to be protect## ed is define## d in the Commission &apos;## s propos## al by the crite## r## ion of degree## s of long## itude and latitude . 
I consider this opt## ion to be political and not technical , or at least not on## ly technical but with a strong political mean## ing . 
not us## ing the crite## r## ion of mile## s off## shore mean## s that the connect## ion with national exclus## ive economic zone## s can be ignor## ed or minimis## ed as some## thing to be for## gotten . 
in view of the negoti## ations , after the period that end## ed in N## ov## ember 20## 03 , to change the regulator## y limit## s from 200 to 12 and th## en to 50 and final## ly to 1## 00 mile## s , the fail## ure of the Commission propos## al to consider the situ## ation creat## ed in the zone between the 1## 00 and 200 mile limit## s is , in my view , serious and need## s to be re## medi## ed . 
all that bring## s us to the key issue of jurisdiction , start## ing with the simpl## e o## mission of the national jurisdiction## s of Spa## in and Port## ugal , which was not omit## ted even in the pre## vi## ous propos## al deal## ing with the Unit## ed K## ing## dom &apos;## s jurisdiction over the re## ef formation## s of the Dar## win Mounds off the Scott## ish coast . 
might that mean that jurisdiction is attribut## ed to the Unit## ed K## ing## dom but is deni## ed or for## gotten - or hid## den - in the case of Spa## in and Port## ugal ? 
we are thu## s arriv## ing at some re## ally sensitiv## e , fundamental issue## s , of the kind that life impose## s when we get down to practical## ities . 
the principle of the European Union &apos;## s exclus## ive compete## nce over the conserv## ation of marine bio## logical resource## s is thu## s enshrine## d in this propos## al even be## fore the rat## ification of the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
s## uch a decision is high## ly deba## table and , for us , un## accept## able , inso## far as it represent## s the replace## ment of national and regional compete## nce over part of the national ter## rit## ory , albeit under the sea , with exclus## ive Comm## un## ity compete## nce . 
the point## s that are clear## ly under discuss## ion here are as follow## s : first## ly , the balance between the exploit## ation of resource## s and the## ir conserv## ation . 
second## ly , this balance was achiev## ed when and where fish## ing was not industrial and predator## y and the conserv## ation of marine bio## logical resource## s was under national and regional jurisdiction on the bas## is of proxim## ity , and there are there## fore no ground## s to replace this jurisdiction in order to reme## dy in## correct or lax practice## s . 
t## hirdly , there are two kind## s of fish## ing - cost## al fish## ing , which is , more or less , or s## till is al## most tradition## al , and industrial fish## ing . 
the former is penal## ised , with a terr## ible impact on soci## ety and the regional econom## ies , by the predator## y nature of the latter , which , be## cause of it## s economic and political power , will more easi## ly continu## e it## s activities . 
four## th## ly , the negoti## ations that are start## ing on total allow## able catch## es and quota## s are an indict## ment of equal treat## ment for what is different and a refut## ation of strate## gies which , on the pre## text of protect## ing the environment , help the &apos; big fish &quot; to swallow up the &apos; li## ttle fish &quot; - and the word &apos; fish &quot; can be replace## d with other## s s## uch as &apos; boat## s , &quot; &apos; fleet## s , &quot; &apos; interest## s &quot; or &apos; countries . &quot; 
my report and the draft amend## ments that I have submit## ted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tri## ed to make clear in this speech , in the hope that this House will vot## e for it . 
I am grat## e## ful for your vot## e and I am also grat## e## ful for all the help and collabo## ration that I have had in tabling this report . 
Mr President , I s## hall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on be## half of Mr## s Ha## s## s## i . 
when we discuss this issue , we need to imagin## e how it would be if the destruct## ion taking place on the sea bed we## re in## stead to happen on land . 
imagin## e if forest## s we## re to be uproot## ed , if all the anim## al## s in them we## re to di## e and if the bird## s we## re to become sil## ent . 
people would be up in arm## s . 
we would all drown in letter## s from anxious people demand## ing that the forest## s be protect## ed . 
now , this is happen## ing on the sea bed . 
the forest## s of the sea are coral re## ef## s at the bottom of the sea , a## mong fish that are un## able to cry out . 
we here in Parliament must there## fore s## peak on be## half of these bio## - and eco @## -## @ system## s with## out a voice . 
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety ha## s tri## ed to express this voice in the form of amend## ments . 
I wish there## fore to emphasis## e that the House should support Amendment No 8 , which was adopt## ed by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety but which , un## fortunate## ly , was reject## ed by the Committee on Fish## eries . 
we must investig## ate what other deep @## -## @ sea habitat## s need to be protect## ed s## o that we might obtain a complete list of these . 
we must , of course , do this in co## operation with the IC## ES to avoid duplic## ation of ef## fort , but we must take respons## ibility for this list &apos;## s be## ing compile## d . 
I also wish to s## peak up for Amendment No 7 , which pick## s up on the import## ant aspect of there be## ing equip## ment other th## an trawl net## s that can damage the sea bed . 
that is why the rule## s should , of course , cover all equip## ment that may damage the sea bed , and it is wise to use the pre## caution## ary principle in these sensitiv## e area## s . 
I think , how## ever , that we should retain the Commission &apos;## s propos## al concern## ing zone## s and thu## s vot## e again## st the second half of the amend## ment . 
the zone## s have a scientific bas## is we are able to accept . 
. - Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , this propos## al , which ha## s be## en adopt## ed by this Parliament &apos;## s Committee on Fish## eries , seek## s to prevent the use of a fish## ing technique that is high## ly dam## aging to the extreme## ly fr## agile marine system## s of deep @## -## @ water coral## s , which not on## ly contribut## e the## ir own rich## ness to bio## divers## ity but are also import## ant eco## logical habitat## s for vari## ous organ## ism## s at vari## ous stag## es in the## ir life cycle## s . 
accord## ing to the Commission , protection is give## n to the area## s a## round Made## ira , the Az## ores and the Can## aries , out## er## most arch## ipelago## s where the tradition## al fish## ing method## s that have be## en us## ed for cent## ur## ies up to the present day have ma## de it possible not on## ly to pre## serve spec## ies but also to maintain thriv## ing fish## ing communit## ies . 
at a time when we are witness## ing grow## ing concern about the main## ten## ance of fish stock## s and when vari## ous recover## y plan## s are be## ing set up in area## s devastate## d by over## fish## ing , the sustain## able fish## ing practise## d in th## ose arch## ipelago## s deserve## s that we should all encourag## e it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it . 
be## side## s , we are talk## ing about area## s where there is no continent## al shelf and there## fore the place## s where fish## ing is possible are confine## d to small sea## mount## s general## ly associate## d with th## ose deep @## -## @ water coral## s . 
it can be s## aid that there is a lot of water a## round th## ose arch## ipelago## s but there are not man## y fish or fish## ing area## s . 
it is there## fore essential to safeguard and protect th## ose area## s from the destruct## ive - high## ly destruct## ive - activities of industrial fisher## ies . 
the emerge## ncy measure## s put in place are al## read## y a help but we have to have last## ing solution## s , and for that reason this Commission propos## al is laud## able . 
non## e## the## less , the propos## ed amend## ments to widen the ban on net## s to include bottom gill net## s make complete sense to me . 
be## cause of the anchor## s us## ed and the risk of los## s , the## y can cause g## host fish## ing and also sea## bed ero## s## ion , threaten## ing the eco## logical balance of the deep @## -## @ water coral## s . 
I there## fore believ## e that the propos## al for a ban should be widen## ed to include gill net## s and also to include the 200 @## -## @ mile zone## s , be## cause this propos## al is bas## ed on maintain## ing what exist## ed until ver## y re## cent## ly . 
with my knowledge of the situ## ation , I can guarantee that by adopt## ing these propos## al## s we will be help## ing to protect the environment and the sustain## able kind of fish## ing that we think should be bas## ed more on prevent## ion th## an on cure . 
. - Mr President , I should like to address a special welcome to the Commission## er on the occasion of hi## s first speech and to offer him our best wish## es for the extreme## ly import## ant and difficult job that he ha## s to do . 
I should also like to tell him , how## ever , that I find it quit## e in## comprehens## ible in this report that , after the mistake was ma## de to liberal## ise bottom trawl## ing and bottom gill net## s a year ago in Regul## ation ( EC ) No 19## 54 / 20## 03 , this mistake is not be## ing correct## ed in respect of bottom gill net## s . 
having read the document## s produce## d by the Commission , which are quit## e specific in indic## ating that bottom gill net## s are extra## ordinarily harm## ful and dam## aging to the environment , we are at a los## s to understand why the Commission want## s to impose this practice in the Auto## nom## ous Region of the Az## ores , where it ha## s n## ever be## en allow## ed . 
that is a back## ward step in nature conserv## ation impose## d by the Commission and by the European institution## s , which make## s no sense at all and is total## ly un## accept## able . 
Commission## er , I ask you to think this matter over more care## fully . 
Mr President , Mr Ribeiro &apos;## s excel## lent report is on the second Commission propos## al seek## ing to protect deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s from the effect## s of trawl## ing . 
the first concern## ed re## ef## s off the north @## -## @ west coast of Scot## land , the Dar## win Mounds , for which I was fortunate en## ough to be rapporteur . 
as with that report , it is essential to appreci## ate just how import## ant deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s are for the marine eco## system . 
the## y can maintain hundred## s of different spec## ies of wild## life , including man## y spec## ies of deep @## -## @ sea fish , and the## y are a vital focus for fish re## productive cycle## s . 
in the case of deep @## -## @ sea fish , gest## ation period## s are extreme## ly long and thu## s any negat## ive impact## s on the habitat## s will have serious effect## s on stock## s , bo## th in the short and the long term . 
we are s## till gather## ing research on the full impact of trawl## ing on deep @## -## @ sea coral re## ef## s , but it certain## ly appear## s that in the short span of time since deep @## -## @ sea trawl## ing beg## an , hundred## s or possibly thousand## s of sea## mount## s and coral re## ef system## s may have be## en devastate## d . 
the AL## DE Group there## fore fully support## s the propos## al and the amend## ments adopt## ed in committee , particular## ly Amendment No 4 emphasis## ing the role of regional advis## ory council## s . 
we commend to you the other amend## ments as adopt## ed in committee . 
we endorse plen## ary Amendment No 8 as well , since it is import## ant to examin## e what other area## s of deep @## -## @ sea coral with## in the EU should be closed to harm## ful fish## ing method## s . 
we can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7 , since that fit## s with the pre## caution## ary approach . 
after consider## able thought , we can## not support the second part of that amend## ment be## cause it could have the effect of leav## ing some of the coral un## protect## ed . 
that is with real regret , since the motiv## ation of the whole of that amend## ment is essential## ly one of conserv## ation . 
we hope ver## y much that the Commission and the Council will bo## th appreci## ate the serious## ness of the concern## s be## ing express## ed . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the excel## lent report by Mr Ribeiro on the propos## al for a Council regulation on the protection of deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s from the effect## s of demersal fish## ing , more general## ly term## ed &apos; trawl## ing , &quot; is time## ly and borne out by man## y stu## dies in this area . 
as we all know , the impact on these environment## s - and this is also tru## e for all type## s of marine environment where in## discrimin## ate fish## ing method## s are us## ed - affect## s not on## ly pelagic and ed## ible s## es## s## ile spec## ies , but also in## ed## ible s## es## s## ile organ## ism## s and , more general## ly , it serious## ly damage## s key breed## ing environment## s . 
this lead## s to resource deplet## ion and a result## ing los## s of economic potent## ial , with serious con## sequenc## es for local communit## ies , particular## ly small @## -## @ scale tradition## al fish## ing business## es . 
in add## ition to the reason## s give## n in the international agree## ments refer## red to in the report , the protection of s## uch environment## s is there## fore an import## ant way to achiev## e not on## ly environment## al protection but also s## table social and economic prospect## s for the communit## ies which per## sever## e in the area## s in question . 
this is tru## e in general for all region## s where fish## ing is a tradition## al resource which , as s## uch , ought to be safeguard## ed , not on## ly by limit## ing the industrial catch by fleet## s from other countries , but also by ens## uring the continu## ed exist## ence of breed## ing habitat## s . 
to that end , it is vital to involve the local communit## ies , and e## special## ly th## ose people involve## d in the sector . 
I there## fore believ## e that the author## ities , local firm## s and associ## ations in the sector , with the help of the Comm## un## ity institution## s , in add## ition to watch## ing over the protect## ed area## s should also be respons## ible for the regular scientific monitor## ing of habitat## s , as well as for provid## ing eco @## -## @ friend## ly inform## ation and ens## uring the professional conduct of th## ose involve## d in fish## ing . 
it would certain## ly also be a good idea to encourag## e the product## ivity of small tradition## al business## es by giving them modern tool## s for research## ing , ident## ifying and catch## ing the## ir resource## s , s## o as to promot## e great## er catch s## elect## ivity in the marine environment and to make it possible for business## es like th## ose to surviv## e competit## ion from industrial fish## ing fleet## s , particular## ly Ja## pan## ese and US one## s . 
Mr President , I must begin by say## ing how surprise## d I was to hear Mr Ribeiro , the rapporteur , s## peak in favour of amend## ments reject## ed by a major## ity of the Committee on Fish## eries . 
I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission &apos;## s propos## al , name## ly the Ribeiro report , as it was adopt## ed in the Committee on Fish## eries . 
we s## hall be vot## ing again## st the amend## ments table## d , for the reason## s I am about to give . 
we are oppose## d to the inclus## ion of bottom set gill net## s be## cause , as every## one is aware , these are static net## s . 
by the## ir ver## y nature , the## y do not erode the sea bottom . 
the amend## ment concern## ed refer## s to a possible bio## logical disaster . 
at most , this could be link## ed to the los## s of these net## s and sub## sequent s## o @## -## @ call## ed g## host fish## ing A## s the Commission## er stated , there is no scientific data re## l## ating to area## s or spec## ies . 
this is why I think it is some## what flip## pant and a bad precede## nt to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the area## s in question . 
in## de## ed , to follow the argument## s through , the gear would have to be ban## ned from all Comm## un## ity water## s . 
it would be interest## ing to see if th## ose who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban . 
I s## hall now turn to the second amend## ment . 
on the bas## is of crite## ria deriv## ed from marine ge## ology and bi## ology , this amend## ment call## s for the protect## ed area## s propos## ed by the Commission to be replace## d by the 200 @## -## @ mile political crite## r## ion . 
it should be point## ed out that , right## ly or wrong## ly , that crite## r## ion is no long## er relev## ant to fisher## ies manage## ment under Comm## un## ity law . 
I must emphasis## e o## nce again that coral re## ef## s are not located exclus## ive## ly with## in a 200 @## -## @ mile radi## us from the Can## ary Island## s , Made## ira and the Az## ores . 
the scientific communit## y accept## s that coral re## ef## s are general## ly found a## round a 1## .000 metre bath## y## metric line . 
in accord## ance with the pre## caution## ary principle , the Commission ha## s there## fore gone up to the 1.5## 00 metre bath## y## metric line The## s## e line## s do not of course t## ally with political and administ## rative demarc## ations . 
in add## ition , in this particular in## stance , the zone## s design## ated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200 @## -## @ mile limit in some case## s . 
international water## s are affect## ed . 
Mr President , these are the reason## s why our group will not support the amend## ments table## d . 
Mr President , I welcome## d the Ribeiro report when it appear## ed , and recognis## ed the rapporteur &apos;## s ef## fort . 
this was be## cause , a## long with the whole House , I believ## e it is import## ant to protect deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s . 
I am bound to say , how## ever , that I have be## en ver## y surprise## d at some of the comment## s ma## de by the rapporteur sub## sequent## ly . 
I endorse what Mr## s Fr## aga ha## s just s## aid , and can on## ly hope that li## ttle flag## s similar to th## ose evident else## where in the Chamber do not sudden## ly appear in front of Mr Ribeiro . 
I must emphasis## e that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7 . 
we certain## ly support the Commission &apos;## s propos## al , but we can## not agree to the add## ition of bottom set gill net## s with## out any scientific just## ification . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al make## s a reference to bottom set gill## net## s or similar gear . 
we believ## e that the add## ition of bottom set gill net## s with no further qual## ification could be ver## y detriment## al to certain fleet## s . 
it could also act as a danger## ous precede## nt . 
we do not support the second part of the amend## ment either . 
this is be## cause it seek## s to replace mari## time location## s establish## ed by the Commission on the bas## is of scientific crite## ria with a reference to water## s under the jurisdiction of Member State## s . 
Mr President , deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s are a resource which deserve## s our protection . 
accord## ing to the Unit## ed Nation## s , deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s are a vulner## able habitat which require special attention . 
IC## ES advis## es that the on## ly way to protect cold @## -## @ water habitat## s from fish## ing damage is to map the habitat## s precise## ly and to close th## ose area## s to the form## s of fish## ing that cause damage . 
the on## ly way to protect deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s is to prohibit the use of bottom trawl## s and similar gear## s . 
it was ear## ly this year that this House recognis## ed deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s , when the Dar## win Mounds , off the north @## -## @ west coast of Scot## land , we## re give## n special status as an area of conserv## ation . 
now we turn to the other deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s off the Can## ary Island## s and a## round Made## ira and the Az## ores , and I hope there will be continu## ation of protection to th## ose area## s on a per## man## ent bas## is . 
deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s should not be destroy## ed by bottom trawl## ing , but should be protect## ed for futur## e generation## s to enjoy . 
- Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I too essential## ly want to express my support for Mr Ribeiro &apos;## s report and the propos## al## s it contain## s . 
ens## uring the sustain## ability of marine bio## logical resource## s is also the best way to protect the most threaten## ed of all spec## ies in certain part## s of the Union : the human spec## ies it## self . 
man## y of the fish## ing communit## ies in some coast## al area## s of the Union , s## uch as the Az## ores or Made## ira , do not have any other alter## native## s at all for the## ir live## lihood## s or the## ir surviv## al . 
in this case , it is the Commission it## self that acknowledg## es that we are deal## ing with ver## y sensitiv## e eco## system## s that are high## ly endanger## ed and require ur## gent protection , particular## ly since there is a consider## able lack of inform## ation about them . 
the simpl## e acknowledg## ment of s## uch fact## s is more th## an en## ough reason to adopt any prevent## ive measure## s that might stop the destruct## ion of th## ose habitat## s . 
the propos## al## s put forward by the rapporteur are a step in that direct## ion . 
the## y will there## fore gain my vot## e and I appeal to this House to vot## e for them as well . 
. 
Mr President , I welcome the general## ly posit## ive comment## s on the propos## al , and will respond ver## y brief## ly to some of the critic## ism## s ma## de . 
on the possible damage by fish## ing other th## an trawl## s : accord## ing to the IC## ES 20## 03 report , trawl## s are the main cause of damage to deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s . 
there is li## ttle evidence of passive gear dam## aging coral re## ef## s , al## though IC## ES mention## s some of these effect## s . 
the Commission is read## y to amend it## s propos## al if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member State## s agree on s## uch an amend## ment . 
with regard to the point concern## ing the extens## ion of the protect## ive zone to the whole EEZ , I would under## line that the propos## al delimit## ed an area that include## s most of the sub## marine mountain## s that have be## en kept in good conditio## n . 
extend## ing the zone of prohibition would add in## significant protection and would there## fore run counter to the principle of proportion## ality . 
having s## aid that , I would also refer to the question of the exclus## ive compete## nce of the Commission with regard to marine resource## s , which is found in the Constitution and to which reference ha## s be## en ma## de . 
this is a principle which was al## read## y establish## ed by European Court of Just## ice case law , and all the Constitution does is to cod## ify it . 
how## ever , the Commission does not den## y the right## s of Spa## in and Port## ugal over the## ir European Eco## nomic Zone . 
it is just that there is no need to mention these right## s of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimit## ed by topo## graphy and by geo## graphic## al feature## s . 
on the point ma## de by Mr## s Att## wool## l concern## ing the role of the regional advis## ory council## s , there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amend## ment the regulation on R## AC## s would it## self have to be amend## ed . 
on an## other point ma## de by Mr## s Att## wool## l , the Commission ha## s re## cent## ly table## d a propos## al on conditio## ns for deep @## -## @ water fish## ing , which will lend protection to these import## ant resource## s . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place at 11.## 30 a.m . 
I should like to welcome a delegation from the parliament of Serb## ia and Monte## negro , who have come to Strasbourg in order to take part in the## ir first inter## parliament## ary meet## ing with the European Parliament , and who are seat## ed in the official gall## ery . 
the delegation is led by the parliament &apos;## s p## resident , Mr Zoran S## ami . 
I hope that this e## vent mark## s the begin## ning of fruit## ful co## operation between our two institution## s . 
the next item is the vot## e . 
( 1 ) 
Mr President , I should like to give notice of some technical amend## ments be## fore the vot## e . 
I have be## en mandate## d to do s## o by the Committee on Budget## s . 
I refer to Budget Line 15 03 01 02 - Leon## ard## o da Vin## ci Pro## gramme , where the amount show## n under commit## ments should be mod## ified to read EUR 20## 5.3## 66## .## 8## 80 . 
in Budget Line 19 09 03 - Aid to displace## d person## s in La## tin American countries , the relev## ant amount from the reserv## e should be enter## ed , name## ly EUR 5## 4.## 500 less th## an the amount give## n in Document 12 . 
I trust the House will agree to these amend## ments . 
if there are no object## ions , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o &apos;## s technical amend## ments are accept## ed . 
Mr President , there is nothing secret about the statement I now make on the bas## is of Rule 1## 57 ; on the contr## ary , I make it open## ly . 
our group ha## s had a discuss## ion about the amount to be approve## d under item 3 . 
this ha## s to do with a great gather## ing in the Rhine## land , from which I come , where the Catholic Church , a## mong other bodies , is organ## ising a great gather## ing of young people . 
I my## self am familiar with this meet## ing , having o## nce be## en able , in an## other capacity , to take part in it . 
it is a good thing . 
this meet## ing is to include a state visit by the Pop## e . 
hi## s Ho## liness will be attend## ing this meet## ing , and what we would like to be certain of is that the gather## ing &apos;## s organise## rs are ask## ed to provid## e the EU institution## s with document## ary confirm## ation that non## e of this money will be us## ed to fund the Pop## e &apos;## s state visit . 
the V## atic## an it## self will have to pay for that . 
Mr President , this is a point of order under the same Rule under which you allow## ed Mr Schu## lz to s## peak . 
I should like to note that this is a clear viol## ation of the Rule## s of Procedure , as well as of the principle## s of good taste . 
Mr Schu## lz appear## s not to understand that the spirit and ethical and moral principle## s exist a## long## side the law . 
I should like to remind Mr Schu## lz of this fact . 
the budget is approve## d . 
does the Council wish to comment , or is it satisfied with Parliament &apos;## s approval ? 
Mr President , you have proceed## ed to your second read## ing on the 20## 05 budget - the first full budget## ary year of the European Union of 25 Member State## s and of the implement## ation of the new St## aff Regul## ations . 
I am pleas## ed to note that the agree## ment reach## ed between our two institution## s d## uring the conciliation meet## ing on 25 N## ov## ember 20## 04 ha## s now be## en include## d in the 20## 05 budget . 
it is ver## y import## ant that for the first year of the new term of this Parliament the two arm## s of the budget## ary author## ity we## re able to reach global agree## ment last N## ov## ember . 
it is a posit## ive signal for the futur## e , bo## th for inter## institutional co## operation and for a good budget for the European Union . 
that is why I would like to take this opportun## ity to thank the Chair## man of the Committee on Budget## s , Mr Lewandow## ski , and the two rapporteur## s , Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o and Mr## s J## ens## en . 
I would also like to thank the Commission## er , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , who## s## e role I have appreci## ated ver## y much . 
the Council can accept the maxim## um rate of increas## e result## ing from your second read## ing . 
thank you ver## y much , Minister . 
Mr President , I should like to table an or## al amend## ment to Recital A ver## y brief## ly - . 
the amend## ment involve## s enter## ing the relev## ant amount## s . 
I s## hall read it in S## pan## ish : 
&apos;## A. where## as the Budget for 20## 05 as adopt## ed by the Parliament amount## s to EUR 11## 6.5## 5## 4.## 13## 5.6## 98 in commit## ments , which represent## s an increas## e of 6.## 1 % on the 20## 04 budget ; and EUR 10## 6.## 3## 00## .000## .000 in payment## s , which represent## s an increas## e of 4.## 4 % on the 20## 04 Budget ; where## as this level of payment## s represent## s 1.0## 04 % of estimate## d G## NI for the year 20## 05 , compar## ed to 1.0## 8 % as establish## ed by the Fina## ncial Perspective , a differ## ence of EUR 7## .9## 35 million , &quot; 
Mr President , could you slow matter## s down , be## cause the translat## ions , which are be## ing relay## ed , are reach## ing us at the time of the follow## ing vot## e ? 
take account of the translat## ions intend## ed for the new Member State## s , which are not done as quick## ly as th## ose for the old Member State## s . 
( 2 ) 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I would like to give a ver## y brief ex## plan## ation of why our group ha## s withdraw## n it## s support for this joint motion for a re## solution . 
the Socialist Group in the European Parliament was oppose## d in principle to this procedure , it be## ing our belief that the Commission should first present it## s programme , with Parliament th## en stating it## s position with respect to it . 
we di## d not manage to get this accept## ed by the Con## ference of President## s and the procedure was adopt## ed . 
up to a certain point , we we## re able to support the word## ing of the re## solution as it stand## s ; it also include## s man## y point## s that we can live with and accept . 
there are , how## ever , a number of essential element## s in this text that lead us in this Group - after a long debate yesterday even## ing - to believ## e at present that it is the Commission that should first state it## s position on these point## s ra## ther th## an Parliament . 
we there## fore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State , under which the govern## ment first present## s it## s programme and the parliament th## en states where it stand## s on it . 
that is what should be done in this in## stance too , and s## o we now expect the Commission to present it## s programme . 
we will not be particip## ating in this vot## e . 
Mr President , if the Socialist Group ha## s be## en able to say what it think## s about this procedure under Rule 15## 2 , th## en other group## s should also be allow## ed to do s## o . 
we are ver## y disappoint## ed that the P## SE Group ha## s withdraw## n it## s name from the joint text , even though it was negotiate## d by two of the## ir vice @## -## @ chair## men . 
we also hope that the P## SE Group realis## es that by vot## ing again## st the compromis## e it is taking the risk that Parliament will not have a position on the new Commission &apos;## s strategic policy object## ive## s . 
does the P## SE Group re## ally want this to happen and spoil the re## put## ation of the European Parliament ? 
I think the House ha## s be## en enlighten## ed by the position## s express## ed by Mr Schu## lz and Mr## s E## k . 
we support the idea of having a flexibil## ity instrument in the EU budget in order to obtain a budget## ing margin for pur## e## ly un## foresee## n expend## iture . 
the object## ive## s must th## en be deal## t with under separat## e arrange## ments . 
the## y may in them## selves be of quit## e different kind## s . 
for ex## ample , the Peace II programme is some## thing just## ified in term## s of it## s be## ing an internal matter for the EU , while we are oppose## d to the EU &apos;## s be## ing involve## d , as an organisation , in fund## ing the re## construct## ion of Iraq . 
the Member State## s them## selves must decide about s## uch ef## fort## s in accord## ance with democratic decision## s in e## ach of th## ose State## s . 
. - A## s we all know , the flexibil## ity instrument , which ha## s a ceil## ing of EUR 200 million , is intend## ed to allow financ## ing in a give## n financial year of specific## ally ident## ified expend## iture which could not be financ## ed with## in the ceil## ing## s avail## able for one or more other head## ing## s . 
it is an extreme## ly import## ant mechan## ism for solv## ing e## mer## ging need## s . 
in the specific case of this year , I also consider it essential that the European Union should mobilise the flexibil## ity instrument to finance the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s involve## ment in the re## habilit## ation , re## construct## ion and stabilis## ation of Iraq , as pledge## d at the Madrid Minister## ial Con## ference , and also to support the peace con## solid## ation process in the Republic of Ireland , which ha## s be## en ex## peri## enc## ing grow## ing inst## ability . 
with regard to the issue of the de## centralise## d age## ncies , I believ## e the time ha## s come to find a structural solution to the ever @## -## @ increas## ing volume of fund## ing that the## y need , and to reconcil## e the## ir fund## ing with the need## s of internal poli## cies . 
over## all , I vot## ed in favour . 
. - This propos## al to reject the budget for 20## 05 , which my group put forward and to which I ma## de a significant contribut## ion , is not on## ly appropriate but also consist## ent . 
it help## s to clar## ify the respons## ibil## ities of th## ose political force## s which deal out critic## ism but do not match it with action . 
I there## fore regret the re## jection of the re## jection . 
the propos## al for re## jection is appropriate , be## cause this is the first full year of the enlarge## d EU , with it## s additional cohes## ion require## ments , and a key year in the debate on the Fina## ncial Perspective## s for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
it is there## fore un## accept## able to produce a Comm## un## ity budget for 20## 05 that ha## s on## ly be## en set above 1 % of the Comm## un## ity G## NI ( by thousand## th## s of a per cent ) for psycho## logical reason## s , while it hide## s it## s clear concord## ance with the object## ive## s of the sign## ator## ies to the &apos; Let## ter of the Six &quot; to continu## e the 20## 04 budget , the low## est in relativ## e term## s since 19## 87 . 
man## y thank## s , Mr President . 
I should like to explain that I vot## ed in favour of Amendment No 1## 27 in Se## ction III on fund## ing for World You## th Day , be## cause this does not form part of an official state visit . 
in## stead it is a meet## ing of young European Christ## ians with the most noble of go## al## s . 
if it we## re not for Mr Schu## lz &apos;## s ideo## logical ob## s## tin## acy , he would be able to see how much Europe could benefit from a meet## ing between it## s young people and the Ho## ly Fa## ther . 
if it we## re not for Mr Schu## lz &apos;## s ideo## logical ob## s## tin## acy and re## luc## tance to take an honest approach to the issue , he would not have con## fuse## d it with an official visit by a head of state , name## ly the Pop## e &apos;## s visit to the Fede## ral Republic of Germa## ny . 
. - I took an active role in the conciliation meet## ing## s which reach## ed agree## ment on the European Union budget for 20## 05 . 
that is good reason to feel proud and satisfied . 
fail## ure of the negoti## ations on the enlarge## d EU &apos;## s first budget would have be## en a terr## ible political signal to s## end out to Europe &apos;## s citizen## s . 
it would have be## en a sign of our in## ability to govern our## selves with 25 Member State## s . 
all Comm## un## ity poli## cies will be du## ly fund## ed in 20## 05 , in accord## ance with the establish## ed priorit## ies . 
compar## ed with 20## 04 , this budget will have an increas## e of 6.5 % and will rise above the symbol## ic value of 1 % of G## NI . 
the Council , Parliament and the Commission have agree## d to a statement by which the level of payment## s will be examin## ed in mid @## -## @ 20## 05 and , if necess## ary , the budget line## s in question will be supplement## ed . 
Port## ugal &apos;## s priorit## ies are take## n in## to account financial## ly in 20## 05 . 
there is great## er provision for regional and cohes## ion policy , as well as for the common agri## cultural policy with it## s pilot project## s , and there are more fund## s for con## clud## ing agree## ments on fisher## ies . 
a budget is evidence of the cred## ibility of the object## ive## s that have be## en set out . 
it is point## less to make grand political statement## s with## out provid## ing the fund## ing to put s## uch intention## s in## to practice . 
the budget for 20## 05 is there## fore a cred## ible instrument . 
the budget re## solution states that the European Parliament regret## s the Council &apos;## s comprehens## ive reduction in payment## s in the agri## cultural sphere . 
we , Mr Anders## son , Mr## s H## ed## h , Mr## s Hedkv## ist Peter## s## en , Mr## s Se## gel## s## tröm and Mr## s West## lun## d , do not agree with this . 
we see no reason for want## ing , in the agri## cultural sphere , to increas## e payment## s further in relation to the Council &apos;## s propos## al . 
. 
the Mode## rate delegation ha## s today abstain## ed from vot## ing in the final vot## e on the re## solution . 
the re## solution contain## s much that is laud## able in our view but , be## cause we vot## ed again## st quit## e a few of the propos## ed expend## iture increas## es in the vot## e on the figure## s for the budget , it was im## possible for us fully to support the re## solution &apos;## s conclusion## s . 
we do not agree with the general critic## ism ma## de of the Council for having reduce## d the s## ize of the budget . 
that is particular## ly the case regard## ing agri## cultural aid . 
we are pleas## ed that the Council is taking a step in the right direct## ion by re## duc## ing this . 
we believ## e , how## ever , that agri## cultural policy is in need of radical reform and we should there## fore have prefer## red there to have be## en further reduction## s . 
we cho## s## e to vot## e in favour of Mr Gar## ri## ga Pol## led## o &apos;## s and Mr## s J## ens## en &apos;## s report in spite of paragraph 2 , which regret## s the Council &apos;## s reduction in payment## s to agri## culture . 
that is a paragraph we can## not support . 
it is un## accept## able for the same budget## ary line to contain two item## s of fund## ing as distinct as that for the six## tieth annivers## ary of the end of fascism and that for the Pop## e &apos;## s visit to Co## log## ne . 
I da## re to hope that this bizarre coll## us## ion is not the result of any shame## ful bargain## ing . 
the gather## ing of young people that the latter e## vent would attract must not be fund## ed from the European budget , but by the Catholic Church , which the e## vent will serve to promot## e . 
I am vot## ing again## st this expend## iture at a time when s## o man## y other spontane## ous initiative## s by young people do not manage to benefit from European credit## s . 
. - O## ur position is clear and well known : we are again## st the war and the US @## -## @ Brit## ish occupation in Iraq and we demand the im## mediate withdraw## al of the occupy## ing force## s from that country . 
that position just## ifies re## jection of the propos## al that the European Union should finance the re## construct## ion of Iraq out of it## s Comm## un## ity budget . 
of course , we support the increas## e in human## itarian and food aid to the Iraq## i population , but we can## not accept that our aid should be us## ed to legitim## ise what happen## ed or to benefit the aggress## or . 
leav## ing a## side position## s of principle , it is un## accept## able that that aid should be financ## ed to the detriment of the European Union &apos;## s co## operation and development policy - in other word## s , at the expense of the less develop## ed countries - just as it is also un## accept## able that there should be no multi## annual frame## work programme , as there was in the case of the Balkan## s . 
we are aware that this report deal## s with the kind of fund## ing to adopt or , in other word## s , how to mobilise an extra EUR 18## 5 million which would other## wise have to be found by re## deploy## ment from other budget head## ing## s . 
we are also aware that the additional amount## s will be us## ed to finance the P## EA## CE programme and the de## centralise## d age## ncies , and that the agree## d amount## s are less th## an what is need## ed and will not solv## e the fund## ing require## ments . 
the Ju## ne List reject## s Parliament &apos;## s draft budget for 20## 05 , which involve## s the EU &apos;## s commit## ments increas## ing to 1.2## 4 % of the EU countries &quot; anticip## ated gross domestic in## come . 
we believ## e that the commit## ments for 20## 05 definite## ly should not exceed the Commission &apos;## s propos## al of 1.1## 4 % . 
even though the payment## s s## till do not exceed 1 % of gross domestic in## come , these will gradual## ly increas## e to the level of the commit## ments in the 20## 05 budget . 
this form## s the point of depart## ure for the long @## -## @ term financial frame## work . 
that is why it is import## ant to come down to a lower level by no later th## an 20## 05 . 
the aim should be to come down be## low the expend## iture ceil## ing of 1 % of gross domestic in## come . 
be## low is a s## elect## ion of propos## ed cut @## -## @ back## s : 
* We believ## e that the EU should begin cut## ting back on agri## cultural aid by no later th## an 20## 05 . 
* The subsid## y to EU political part## ies should be complete## ly abolish## ed . 
* The subsid## y for tobacco cultiva## tion should be abolish## ed . 
it should be the respons## ibility of the individual countries success## fully to help the farm## ers concern## ed convert to other crop## s . 
* The subsid## y for inform## ation provision can be reduce## d be## cause we believ## e it to be difficult , political## ly , to provid## e object## ive inform## ation prior to the refer## endum## s on the Constitution . 
we believ## e it is the respons## ibility of the individual countries and of the political part## ies in these countries to provid## e s## uch inform## ation . 
the EU should avoid inter## fer## ing in the democratic process in the Member State## s . 
the Dan## ish Liberal Part## y &apos;## s Member## s of the European Parliament - Mr## s Ri## is @## -## @ Jørgensen , Mr Bus## k and Mr## s J## ens## en - vot## ed again## st Amendment No 3 , table## d by the In## depend## ence and Demo## cracy Group . 
the Liberal Part## y is in favour of reform## ing the payment of travel expense## s in s## uch a way that all reason## able and necess## ary travel expense## s are refund## ed . 
that is not some## thing that will be guarantee## d by this amend## ment . 
. - Con## s## ist## ent with our propos## al to reject the Comm## un## ity budget for 20## 05 , we vot## ed again## st this report , which reflect## s the degree of hypo## cris## y and white## wash## ing that ha## s run through the budget## ary procedure that is now end## ing . 
Parliament is critic## ising the Council , complain## ing that it is re## duc## ing payment## s in agri## culture , that it does not accept it## s propos## al## s , that it is un## will## ing to assess the need## s of the European age## ncies and that it ha## s force## d it to make cut## s compar## ed with first read## ing ; more th## an en## ough reason## s for reject## ing it . 
de## spite this scenario , Parliament welcome## s the agree## ment reach## ed with the Council at the conciliation of 25 N## ov## ember and white## wash## es the procedure by claim## ing that , thank## s to it## s ef## fort## s , &apos; drastic cut## s we## re avoid## ed &quot; and it## s tradition## al priorit## ies we## re retain## ed , which is manifest## ly un## tru## e . 
un## fortunate## ly , that ha## s be## en the story of all the budget## ary procedure## s since 20## 00 . 
in that time , the flexibil## ity instrument ha## s be## en us## ed f## ive time## s in a row , there## by just## ifying the Port## uguese Communist Part## y &apos;## s propos## al to review the current financial perspective . 
every year , Parliament accept## s term## s that call even it## s budget## ary power## s in## to question , for the sake of the sacr## o## sanct St## ability Pact . 
that beg## s the question , th## en , of why it want## s to strength## en it## s power## s if it does not make use of them . 
. - I wish to reiterate the comment## s al## read## y ma## de at first read## ing , regret## ting that this draft budget for the financial year 20## 05 should , over## all , total on## ly 1.0## 04 % of the Gross Dom## es## tic Product ( G## DP ) of the 25 European Union Member State## s . 
I should like it to be more ambitious , as is essential after the access## ion of ten new Member State## s , and to make sense of the dis## course of th## ose who say the## y want to develop institutional Europe by mov## ing in## to new poli## cies and area## s of respons## ibility . 
in view of the negoti## ations as a whole , how## ever , and the real economic and financial difficult## ies of the current situ## ation , I would high## light certain result## s that we## re achiev## ed in the difficult conciliation process . 
I believ## e it is significant that we have go## t past the psycho## logical thresh## old of the 1 % impose## d in the &apos; Let## ter of the Six , &quot; even if on## ly by a tin## y amount . 
I consider certain advance## s to have be## en posit## ive , name## ly in the area of mari## time safety ( particular## ly poll## ution ) and the main## ten## ance of the frame## work of structural poli## cies and external poli## cies , e## special## ly in development aid ; I also welcome the special relation## ships with AC## P countries . 
the rapporteur &apos;## s comment## s are realistic and point to a certain inconsiste## ncy in the project announce## d in the Commission &apos;## s propos## al , that this would be the budget of &apos; competitive## ness and cohes## ion . &quot; 
I expect some## thing much better from the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
we believ## e that the European Union &apos;## s policy on fisher## ies agree## ments need## s to be revise## d . 
over @## -## @ exploit## ation of fish## ing water## s force## s people in## to even great## er p## over## ty and rob## s the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain . 
it would be better if th## ose countries with which the EU enter## s in## to fisher## ies agree## ments we## re in## stead to be give## n assist## ance s## o that the## y them## selves might develop the## ir own fish## ing indus## tries . 
we do not accept amend## ments where## by the Commission would be give## n an in## dependent source of in## come . 
we believ## e that , if the EU conclude## s a fisher## ies agree## ment with a thir## d country , the total amount of financial compens## ation for this thir## d country must be fund## ed by th## ose EU Member State## s who## s## e fish## ing vessel## s make use of what is offer## ed under the agree## ment in question . 
the Member State## s should pay in proportion to the s## ize of the## ir catch## es . 
these Member State## s must th## en e## ach decide for them## selves whet## her the## y , in turn , will fund this expend## iture by tax## ing the## ir respect## ive fish## ing vessel## s . 
. - I vot## ed for this report be## cause of the import## ance of the issue of fisher## ies to Port## ugal , specific## ally in the case of international fisher## ies agree## ments in which the Port## uguese fish## ing indus## try ha## s a direct interest . 
my vot## e was also bas## ed on the fact that an extens## ion of the exist## ing protocol is on the table and the suggest## ed amend## ments do not damage national interest## s in any way . 
. - This propos## al is about address## ing the period between the expir## y of the protocol attach## ed to the fisher## ies agree## ment between the European Union and the Islamic Fede## ral Republic of the Com## or## os and the d## ate by which the Commission believ## es the assess## ments need## ed to re## negotiate the agree## ment will have be## en complete## d . 
in view of the consider## able activity by the Comm## un## ity fleet in that marine area ( 40 tuna sein## ers and 25 surface long## liner## s ) , the propos## ed solution is to extend the pre## vi## ous agree## ment until a new fisher## ies protocol ha## s be## en conclude## d . 
extens## ion will not mean any change to the term## s and restrict## ions of the pre## vi## ous protocol , and the financial compens## ation and fish## ing opportun## ities for the Member State## s will be maintain## ed . 
as the Port## uguese fleet ha## s fish## ing opportun## ities for f## ive surface long## liner## s in that area , it is import## ant that Port## ugal should support this extens## ion and press for a favour## able re## negoti## ation of the agree## ment . 
I vot## ed for the report . 
. - I am de## light## ed at the decision that Article 67 of the Treat## y can be fully implement## ed , s## o that topic## s under Title IV , s## uch as im## migration , asy## lum and border control## s , can be decide## d by qualified major## ity vot## ing under the co## decision procedure . 
we improve efficiency and we strength## en the role of this Parliament , guarantee## ing the principle of democratic legitim## acy , which is fundamental for the adopt## ion of legisl## ation on topic## s as sensitiv## e as asy## lum and im## migration policy and other## s that involve people &apos;## s fundamental right## s . 
I support Mr Bou## rlanges &apos;## s report as well as the two concrete propos## al## s that he make## s , be## cause : 
- co## decision and qualified major## ity vot## ing on legal im## migration are essential for the manage## ment of the Union &apos;## s migration policy . 
with the sign## ing of the Constitution on 29 October 20## 04 , it was ma## de clear that the measure## s laid down on legal im## migration must not affect the Member State## s &quot; right to determine the number of thir## d country national## s the## y can admit to the## ir ter## rit## ories for the purpose of seek## ing work there . 
- the restrict## ions on the Court &apos;## s compete## nce## s in Title IV that we## re introduce## d at Amsterdam , as there we## re fear## s of too much work and excess## ive delay## s , do not make sense either , give## n the introdu## ction at N## ice of Article 22## 5 ( a ) .## .. 
. 
legisl## ation on asy## lum and im## migration policy ha## s for year## s be## en pro## found## ly un## democratic . 
one thing the Treat## y of Amsterdam di## d was to transfer legisl## ative power## s in this area from the Member State## s to the EC , thu## s taking it out of the hand## s of national parliament## s ; an## other was to hand it over to the Council exclus## ive## ly , and hence to the assemble## d national executive## s , with Parliament &apos;## s involve## ment limit## ed to the stating of position## s . 
in an area s## uch as this , with s## uch consider## able implic## ations for fundamental right## s , it is un## ten## able that the executive should make law in this way . 
this draft Council decision on the adopt## ion of the co## decision procedure is thu## s a long over## due step to## ward## s giving Parliament a great## er say in legisl## ation . 
at the same time , though , the Council is plan## ning to reserv## e again certain area## s exclus## ive## ly to the executive . 
this is precise## ly what the Bou## rlanges report criticise## s , and that is why I endorse the report . 
what I see as problematic about this report , how## ever , is that it insist## s upon a provision in the Constitution where## by Member State## s can unilateral## ly bar thir## d @## -## @ country national## s from gain## ing access to the labour market . 
when I was a member of the Constitution## al Convent## ion , I was critical of this rule , which was introduce## d in## to the Constitution by the Germa## n Govern## ment . 
not on## ly does it reflect national ego## ism## s , but also - and this is a much more serious matter - it run## s counter to the principle that workers should enjoy free## dom of move## ment in a common Europe . 
in my judge## ment , this provision is one of the first thing## s that should be submit## ted to scrutin## y after the Constitution ha## s enter## ed in## to force . 
. - The rapporteur s## ought to propos## e that the Court of Just## ice should have it## s compete## nce broad## ened through the re## vocation of Article 68 of the EC Treat## y . 
that was an add## ition to the propos## al for a Council decision , in that sever## al area## s of Title IV , Part III of the EC Treat## y ( vis## as , asy## lum , im## migration and other poli## cies concern## ing the free move## ment of person## s ) would th## en be govern## ed by Article 25## 1 of the EC Treat## y . 
as I have al## read## y argu## ed on other occasion## s , I think that the Union should gradual## ly consolidate it## s compete## nce## s and practice## s ra## ther th## an try to satisf## y a const## ant appet## ite for new compete## nce## s . 
every propos## al deal## s with sensitiv## e material , and the report &apos;## s add## ition suffer## s from the maxim## al## ism typical of a central## ising Europe , even though that path does not enjoy popular support . 
I am not s## ure that the propos## ed re## vocation would strength## en the legal protection of European citizen## s and thir## d country national## s in the s## light## est , as Mr Bou## rlanges claim## s it would . 
I believ## e , ra## ther , that it would have exact## ly the opposite effect . 
I think Parliament would do better if it confine## d it## self to support## ing the propos## al for a decision as present## ed - which in it## self represent## s a major , ambitious advance for the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice - and if it could refrain from embark## ing on this un## health## y , vora## cious pur## suit of &apos; what lies beyond . &quot; 
the measure## s propos## ed in the report - th## ose design## ed to strength## en demo## cracy , human right## s and the function of the constitutional state in thir## d countries - are bad## ly require## d and often necess## ary . 
we wonder , how## ever , whet## her these measure## s should be implement## ed by the EU . 
with it## s long experience and global import## ance , the UN is better plac## ed to implement them . 
we also object to the large s## um of money - approximate## ly EUR 22## 5 million - appropriate## d for these ef## fort## s for the period 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 06 . 
the object## ive## s and the ef## fort## s concern## ed are not clear## ly define## d or limit## ed , and experience of the EU &apos;## s ability to use s## uch money is not encourag## ing . 
for these reason## s , we cho## ose to vot## e again## st the report . 
. - The subject of the Commission &apos;## s propos## al , which the rapporteur endorse## s , is to maintain until the end of 20## 06 a legal bas## is and a financial frame## work for operation## s to protect and promot## e human right## s and democratic principle## s in develop## ing countries and other thir## d countries . 
I vot## ed for it be## cause I consider that to do s## o would be bo## th extreme## ly use## ful and thorough## ly just## ified at a time when ver## y import## ant question## s regard## ing the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s foreign policy are at s## take . 
. - Comm## un## ity fund## ing under the present regulation take## s the form of subsid## ies or contra## cts , which the Commission is propos## ing should also be extend## ed to corporate bodies where appropriate . 
I agree with that . 
particip## ation by civil soci## ety should be support## ed , regard## less of the kind of the institutional structure involve## d in e## ach individual case . 
it is imperative that the European Union should continu## e , improve and intens## ify the action## s describ## ed in the Commission communic## ation of 8 May 20## 01 entitle## d &apos; The European Union &apos;## s role in promot## ing human right## s and democrat## isation in thir## d countries . &quot; 
the European Union is the last window of hope in the eye## s of man## y people . 
as the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s demonst## rated ( with on## ly one abstention ) , we must there## fore provid## e the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s ( EI## DH## R ) with all possible instrument## s to ful## fil it## s object## ive## s , focus## ing prim## arily on support for democrat## isation , good govern## ance and the rule of law . 
for the rest , I refer to the speech I ma## de yesterday d## uring the debate in the House . 
I vot## ed for the report , of course . 
Mr President , I will be ver## y brief . 
I want## ed to say that I vot## ed in favour of the report and that I hope we will be able to make consider## able progress in this area in futur## e . 
I also address## ed a question to the new Commission about this , suggest## ing the introdu## ction of civil## ian service for young people in the European Union - whet## her mal## e or female - prim## arily to creat## e the right conditio## ns in s## uch situ## ations , result## ing in a great## er sense of respons## ibility and aware## ness a## mong the people in the European Union , not on## ly when disaster## s strike , but also d## uring a civil## ian service design## ed to increas## e solid## arity . 
as I have s## aid , I am general## ly in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done a## long these line## s . 
. I have vot## ed again## st the Papa## dimoulis report today . 
a look back reveal## s this to be consist## ent with my past vot## ing . 
the reason is that , in my opinion , the Comm## un## ity action programme does not pass the subsid## i## arity test . 
the Member State## s all have the## ir own civil @## -## @ protection programme## s and the## ir own co## ordination , train## ing and assist## ance programme## s . 
some European co## operation is in order , but a separat## e European centre with it## s own power## s and 24 @## -## @ hour monitor## ing is un## necess## ary . 
be## side## s , the financial bas## is for the propos## al is flaw## ed , which is a second reason for me to with## hold my support for this propos## al . 
. 
natural disaster## s s## uch as flood## s , heat @## -## @ wave## s , forest fire## s , earth## quake## s , environment## al disaster## s cause## d by toxic waste re## lease , toxic industrial accident## s , serious industrial accident## s and terrorist attack## s are , by nature , extreme## ly un## predict## able , and con## sequent## ly claim count## less victim## s and cause significant economic damage . 
what we must do is work together and exchange inform## ation , stream## line resource## s , carry out research and seek technical solution## s that limit the damage as far as possible , but most import## ant## ly , we must pursu## e a policy of invest## ing in prevent## ion and educ## ation involv## ing political institution## s at Comm## un## ity , national , regional and local level and all civil soci## ety organisation## s in a un## ified , respons## ible and different## iated partner## ship . 
people say , in the## ir in## finite wisdom , that &apos; prevent## ion is better th## an cure , &quot; and this dic## tum apt## ly appli## es to the forest fire## s that devastate## d Port## ugal in the summer## s of 20## 03 and 20## 04 and to the oil s## pill## s from the and tank## ers . 
we welcome the fact that the Comm## un## ity action plan in the field of civil protection ha## s be## en extend## ed and that it## s budget ha## s be## en increas## ed , but we also feel that this is an issue that , in light of it## s per## man## ent nature , should not be subject to time constrain## ts . 
civil protection intervention also fall## s under the categor## y of mainstream## ing : bas## ed on new agri## cultural model## s and land @## -## @ use plan## ning that human## ises urban and industrial grow## th .## .. 
there is a significant risk of the financial resource## s provid## ed going on administ## ration and of the resource## s thu## s not be## ing co## ordinate## d efficient## ly en## ough . 
al## though we are ver## y well dispos## ed to## ward## s different countries show## ing solid## arity with one an## other when disaster## s occur , we do not believ## e that this is prim## arily an issue for the EU , but that the Member State## s &quot; respect## ive national parliament## s should decide what financial resource## s should be provid## ed when a serious accident occur## s in an## other Member State . 
. - We would like to observ## e that financ## ing of action## s for natural and man @## -## @ ma## de disaster## s is s## o limit## ed that , essential## ly , it cancel## s out any possibil## ity of material intervention and efficiency . 
for us , damage prevent## ion is more import## ant th## an cure , by which we mean support## ing poli## cies , action## s and infra## structure## s which limit damage and los## s## es in the e## vent of disaster . 
how## ever , how can this happen when every## thing is judge## d by depress## ing financial crite## ria and the interest## s of big business ? 
when a s## eries of public compete## nce## s is transfer## red to privat## e individual## s , how can any## one talk serious## ly of the adopt## ion of a fundamental policy of protection again## st any sort of disaster ? 
when no money is avail## able for anti @## -## @ flood work## s , when anti @## -## @ earth## quake standard## s are not met , when forest## s are left at the mer## cy of ar## son## ists and land cannibal## s , when ship## owner## s remain un## account## able and un## punish## ed after huge eco## logical disaster## s , what protection can we talk of ? 
how can efficient civil protection be organise## d when public good## s and service## s need## ed in critical situ## ations , s## uch as the fire brigade , are be## ing transfer## red to privat## e individual## s or turn## ed in## to repress## ive mechan## ism## s ? 
and th## en , what use is be## ing ma## de of even these crumb## s of s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; restitution ? 
if you want a sil## enc## ing answer , ask the victim## s of the 19## 99 earth## quake in Greece s## till liv## ing in contain## ers . 
. 
I should like to congratul## ate Mr Papa## dimoulis on hi## s excel## lent report on the propos## al for a Council decision amend## ing Decision 19## 99 / 84## 7 / EC as regard## s the extens## ion of the Comm## un## ity action programme in the field of civil protection . 
the aim is to ensu## re continu## ity in this area until a new legal instrument enter## s in## to force . 
the purpose of this programme is to protect the citizen## s , the environment and proper## ty in the e## vent of natural or man @## -## @ ma## de disaster## s through## out the Comm## un## ity , by making avail## able additional support from the other particip## ating countries when national respons## e capacities are overwhelm## ed . 
since this programme was adopt## ed , we have seen it## s effective## ness and the need for action at European level , not least when the was ship## wreck## ed and d## uring the fire## s of summer 20## 03 . 
further## more , the report high## light## s seven area## s in which the programme could be improve## d , most import## ant## ly th## ose of co## operation , exchange of inform## ation and increas## ed resource## s . 
I should also like to express my support for increas## ing the annual budget for this programme to EUR 2.## 4 million per year in 20## 05 and 20## 06 . 
. 
give## n that the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s civil protection programme current## ly in force expir## es on 31 Dec## ember of this year , I believ## e that it would be entire## ly appropriate for the programme to be extend## ed for two year## s to fill the gap between the expir## y of the exist## ing programme and the ent## ry in## to force of the new instrument . 
I regret , how## ever , that the programme is to be extend## ed with## out the necess## ary review## s of the period 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 04 be## ing car## ried out . 
on the other hand , the increas## ed fund## ing re## quest## ed by the Commission is realistic and , in the case of Port## ugal , particular## ly import## ant . 
I there## fore vot## ed in favour . 
. 
vari## ous disaster## s , s## uch as the accident , the forest fire## s , particular## ly in my country , and the flood## s in the South of France have demonst## rated the need for action at European level . 
the scale of some disaster## s often overwhelm## s national respons## e capacities . 
mechan## ism## s at European level , s## uch as the one creat## ed by the current programme , are there## fore be## coming increas## ing## ly just## ified . 
the propos## al take## s a step in this direct## ion , provid## ing for an increas## e of EUR 1.5 million in 20## 04 to EUR 2.## 4 million per year in 20## 05 and 20## 06 . 
I welcome this development , which form## s part of the strength## ened co## operation in the area of civil protection , which the EU beg## an to address in the first Comm## un## ity A## ction Pro## gramme in the field of Civil Protect## ion adopt## ed in 19## 97 , the most significant development of which was the creation of the Solidar## ity Fund for major disaster## s in N## ov## ember 20## 02 . 
the Mon## ito## ring and In## formation Centre is ver## y import## ant , as it provid## es Member State## s or thir## d countries with some## where to s## end re## quest## s for assist## ance . 
a per## man## ent network of contact## s ha## s thu## s be## en set up with## in the Commission aim## ed at establish## ing un## interrupt## ed contact between the civil protection centre## s in the particip## ating countries and at promot## ing the exchange of inform## ation . 
. the Commission &apos;## s propos## al is to ban the use of bottom trawl## s in certain area## s that include the sea## mount## s with the most sensitiv## e habitat## s in the 200 mile## s a## round the Az## ores , Made## ira and the Can## ary Island## s . 
similar restrict## ions are al## read## y in place in an area of North## west Scot## land . 
I feel that we must go further , and also ban the use of bottom gill## net## s . 
in## de## ed , this type of net also cause## s serious damage to eco## system## s , particular## ly in the Az## ores exclus## ive economic zone , due to the vol## can## ic and rock## y nature of it## s sea## bed . 
vari## ous stu## dies have confirm## ed the sensitiv## e nature of deep @## -## @ water habitat## s , s## uch as the deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef , ther## mal vent## s and feed## ing ground## s for fish of sea bank## s and sea## mount## s . 
. 
I wish to offer my whole## hearted support for the Commission &apos;## s propos## al amend## ing Regul## ation ( EC ) No 8## 50 / 98 , of 30 Mar## ch , as regard## s the protection of deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s from the effect## s of trawl## ing in certain area## s of the Atlantic Ocean ( COM ( 20## 04 ) 58 F ) . 
I applaud the Commission for tabling this propos## al , be## cause in s## o do## ing the Commission is keeping it## s promise to propos## e an amend## ment to the technical measure## s in force in the Comm## un## ity aim## ed at ban## ning the use of bottom trawl gear up to at least 200 mile## s a## round the out## er## most region## s of the Az## ores , Made## ira and the Can## aries , with the aim of protect## ing eco## system## s in some of the most sensitiv## e area## s located at the &apos; sea## mount## s &quot; out## side 1## 00 mile## s . 
the deep @## -## @ water habitat## s that the Commission &apos;## s propos## al is target## ing we## re until re## cent## ly protect## ed from trawl## ing ( use of bottom trawl or similar tow## ed net## s oper## ating in contact with the bottom of the sea ) , due to the special access regime laid down in access## ion negoti## ations . 
this regime cease## d to app## ly in August 20## 04 , and s## o it was essential to guarantee the continu## ity of the protection of these area## s as part of Comm## un## ity legisl## ation . 
. 
the protection of the deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s in the Atlantic Ocean is , natural## ly , of special interest to Port## ugal . 
the propos## al is to ban the use of bottom trawl## ing in the water## s of the Az## ores and Made## ira , as well as in the Can## ary Island## s , in order to protect deep @## -## @ water coral re## ef## s , which are of enormous import## ance in term## s of protect## ing bio## divers## ity . 
it is estimate## d that 65 % of fish spec## ies in the sea are dependent on re## ef## s at some point in the## ir life . 
in light of this need for effective protection , we are in favour of extend## ing the ban to bottom gill## net## s , which also cause serious damage to th## ose eco## system## s due to g## host fish## ing . 
whi## lst I am not satisfied with the final result of the vot## e on the amend## ments , I whole## hearted## ly welcome what this report ha## s achiev## ed , and there## fore vot## ed in favour . 
. 
the propos## al for a regulation be## fore us seek## s to ban the use of bottom trawl## ing in the most environment## ally sensitiv## e area## s in the first 200 sea mile## s a## round the Az## ores , Made## ira and the Can## ary Island## s . 
I broad## ly support the propos## ed measure## s and feel that it is vital## ly import## ant that the specific character## istic## s of e## ach area are proper## ly take## n in## to account . 
accord## ing## ly I also support## ed the amend## ment propos## al## s aim## ed at also ban## ning bottom gill## net## s , and deep## ly regret that this measure was not in## corporate## d in## to the final version drawn up by the committee concern## ed , contr## ary to the rapporteur &apos;## s re## commend## ation . 
a## long with vari## ous Member## s of this House , I have campaign## ed for it to be rein## stated and adopt## ed in plen## ary . 
it is well known that this kind of net is extreme## ly harm## ful to eco## system## s , particular## ly give## n the overwhelm## ing prob## ability of g## host fish## ing . 
in the particular case of the Az## ores , the risk is all the great## er give## n the vol## can## ic nature of the sea## bed . 
it there## fore ma## de no sense on## ly to go half## way to## ward## s protection . 
. 
this is y## et an## other re## solution in which the Port## uguese social## ists ( PS ) , social democrat## s ( P## SD ) and popular right ( CD## S @## -## @ P## P ) , us## ing language sprink## led with obfusc## ations and o## mission## s , re## affirm - together ! - the## ir policy opt## ions and the EU &apos;## s fundamental axe## s , name## ly neoliberal## ism , federal## ism and militarism . 
it is a package that is &apos; nice## ly &quot; wrap## ped up in the language of concern for social issue## s and of good intention## s , a package that seek## s to cover up it## s contradict## ions and the tru## e nature of the right @## -## @ wing policy effective## ly pursu## ed at EU level , with the de## vast## ating impact that it ha## s . 
the PS , P## SD and CD## S @## -## @ P## P can try all the## y like to deflect attention from , or hide , the## ir broad understand## ing , y## et re## ality is giving the game away . 
let us keep that in mind , in Port## ugal , on 20 Fe## bru## ary of next year . 
there are a number of sens## ible point## s of view in the motion for a re## solution , but also a number of propos## al## s that it is im## possible for us member## s of the Ju## ne List to vot## e in favour of . 
in particular , we are oppose## d to the follow## ing four paragraph## s of the motion for a re## solution . 
paragraph 20 : &apos; the European Parliament high## light## s the continu## ing need for action to strength## en the EU &apos;## s external border## s , back## ed by the creation of a European corp## s of border guard## s . &quot; 
paragraph 21 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; urge## s that a European Ag## ency for fundamental right## s be establish## ed to monitor the## ir application effective## ly . &quot; 
last part of paragraph 33 : &apos; &#91; the European Parliament &#93; urge## s continu## ed parallel reform of the common fisher## ies policy , including the creation of a European Fish## eries Fund . &quot; 
paragraph 40 states : &apos; &#91; Parliament &#93; believ## es that the Commission should draw up , as a matter of urge## ncy , an appropriate communic## ation and campaign strate## gy which present## s the new Constitution to Europe &apos;## s citizen## s in as clear , fair and understand## able a way as possible . &quot; 
we would note that there are vari## ous view## s of what an &apos; appropriate strate## gy &quot; is in this con## text . 
in view of the above , we definite## ly can## not vot## e in favour of this motion for a re## solution . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of the compromis## e motion for a re## solution on the Commission &apos;## s political orient## ations and wish to high## light in particular the pact on the economic , social and territorial cohes## ion poli## cies . 
as I have s## aid on man## y occasion## s , I feel that cohes## ion policy is a gui## d## ing principle and the ver## y back## bone of the entire EU , with## out which the EU would lose it## s ra## ison d &quot; être . 
with## out cohes## ion poli## cies , the EU would be no more th## an a &apos; hyper @## -## @ market , &quot; an instrument of sub## ordination to the big and the domin## ant , in all field## s . 
as one of the EU &apos;## s found## ing principle## s , the principle of cohes## ion is , more## over , a fundamental## ly Christ## ian @## -## @ Democrat## ic con## cept . 
the Left is welcome to join us in this interpret## ation , but we must not leave it to the Left to advoc## ate and defend principle## s that are our## s . 
in other word## s , we must develop competitive## ness , but with## out dam## aging cohes## ion ; ra## ther , we must make cohes## ion strong## er . 
Mr President , as a substitute member of the Deleg## ation to EU @## -## @ Bulgaria Jo## int Parliament## ary Committee , I want to congratul## ate Mr Van Or## den on hi## s report and to note the ver## y posit## ive progress Bulgaria ha## s ma## de to## ward## s member## ship of the European Union . 
we hope the## y will be member## s in a few year## s &apos; time . 
I want to enter one caveat : there is s## till serious evidence about the lack of professional## ism of the Bulgaria## n judic## iary and of it## s lack of in## depend## ence . 
I would urge the Bulgaria## n Govern## ment to address th## ose issue## s with## in the next year s## o that the## y can become member## s in 20## 07 . 
, . as we have repeat## ed## ly point## ed out , the intrinsic economic and political aim## s of the current enlarge## ment are there for all to see , and o## nce again express## ed in the re## solution vot## ed on just now . 
the re## solution gloss## es over the fact that implement## ing neoliberal poli## cies is a pre## requisite for , and a back## drop to , EU access## ion , al## though it does mention the de## ified &apos; function## ing market econom## y , &quot; which mean## s capital## ism and the domin## ation and exploit## ation of an increas## ing## ly s## ize## able port## ion of that country &apos;## s econom## y by the large financial and economic group## s . 
it also mention## s &apos; direct foreign invest## ment , &quot; which , to some people &apos;## s de## light , ha## s reach## ed &apos; record level## s , &quot; which mean## s even great## er domin## ation of the Bulgaria## n econom## y by the large financial group## s . 
applaud## ing Bulgaria &apos;## s ef## fort## s is at vari## ance with the EU &apos;## s much @## -## @ trumpet## ed aim## s . 
economic and social cohes## ion can## not be built on the found## ation of competit## ion and the re## location of capital as a function of increas## ing## ly un## bridl## ed exploit## ation . 
that activity , which leave## s un## employ## ment and p## over## ty in it## s wake - as evidence## d by comp## any re## location## s in Port## ugal - does not creat## e genuine wealth in the country concern## ed . 
the re## solution it## self mention## s that man## y people have not detect## ed any improve## ment in the## ir economic situ## ation and that e## migration continu## es . 
. 
in common with the Commission , and with the report be## fore us , I feel that Bulgaria ha## s ma## de the necess## ary progress to## ward## s EU access## ion , bo## th at economic and at judicial level , al## though it should be acknowledg## ed , a## mong other similar## ly import## ant issue## s , that crime , corrupt## ion and the traffick## ing of human be## ing## s must be combat## ed more effective## ly . 
again## st this back## drop , and give## n that the on## going reform## s can be achiev## ed in time , I am in favour of the idea of Bulgaria join## ing the EU , depend## ing on &apos; own merit## s crite## ria , &quot; and there## fore feel that the Access## ion Treat## y must be conclude## d in 20## 05 s## o that access## ion can take place in Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
I there## fore vot## ed in favour . 
Mr President , again I congratul## ate the rapporteur on hi## s report and note with satisf## action the progress that Roman## ia ha## s ma## de to## ward## s member## ship of the Comm## un## ity . 
how## ever , I enter a different caveat this time : the situ## ation of orphan## s and young child## ren . 
the state of the home## s in Roman## ia is s## till un## accept## able . 
I would again ask the Roman## ian Govern## ment to address this be## fore member## ship . 
final## ly , Mr President , I thank you and your excel## lent staff for all the co## operation through the year , and wish you a Mer## ry Christ## mas . 
. 
the report be## fore us - follow## ing on from the pre## vi## ous one## s - assess## es progress from the perspective of the overwhelm## ing## ly neoliberal and capital## ist nature of the enlarge## ment process . 
it offer## s us a fair## ly extens## ive present## ation of the crite## ria to be met and of the progress al## read## y ma## de . 
it make## s critic## ism## s and offer## s praise in s## uch a way that these countries end up view## ing every## thing in term## s of , and mov## ing ever close## r to , adopt## ing and implement## ing a legal / institutional frame## work , the &apos; Comm## un## ity , &quot; which act## s as the found## ation of the EU &apos;## s neoliberal model . 
th## ose who advoc## ate this policy are s## o keen that the## y have no compunction about tabling propos## al## s that clear## ly attempt to settle old score## s with the histo## ry of the people &apos;## s struggle , and s## o here come## s , for the thousand## th time , the tired old de## vot## ion to &apos; market economic## s , &quot; &apos; structural reform## s &quot; with## in the frame## work of &apos; competit## ion &quot; and &apos; market force## s , &quot; &apos; implement## ing the process of privat## isation &quot; and &apos; d## ism## ant## ling un## vi## able business## es &quot; and &apos; creat## ing an atmosphere that is con## duc## ive to business and to foreign invest## ment . &quot; 
these demand## s are const## ant## ly reiterate## d , albeit accompani## ed by hypo## critical regret for the## ir de## vast## ating impact on workers and the people . 
. the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support## s the Mos## co## vici report , with explic## it reference to the strict agree## ments that have be## en ma## de on monitor## ing the progress of reform## s and the## ir application , particular## ly in term## s of the political crite## ria : human right## s , corrupt## ion and the in## depend## ence of the judic## iary . 
the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not hesit## ate to call on the Commission to app## ly the safeguard## s define## d in the pre @## -## @ access## ion strate## gy if Roman## ia &apos;## s progress give## s cause to do s## o . 
the Dutch delegation from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament reserv## es the right to adopt a different position in spring when it come## s to the definitive decision on Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion , for in## stance if it should emerge that Roman## ia &apos;## s new govern## ment ha## s not kept it## s promise## s . 
that could mean end## ing the link between the access## ions of Roman## ia and Bulgaria . 
. 
in Fe## bru## ary 20## 04 , Parliament adopt## ed a report that express## ed regret that , de## spite some progress , Roman## ia s## till had not complete## ly satisfied the C## open## hagen crite## ria . 
in the mean## time , as we approach the end of this year , the con## sensus of opinion is that progress to## ward## s access## ion ha## s be## en ma## de , al## though it is recognis## ed that there are s## till man## y area## s in which this object## ive ha## s y## et to be met in full . 
it there## fore make## s complete sense for us to seek to negotiate the term## s of the Treat## y in 20## 05 and that a safeguard clause be insert## ed in case Roman## ia &apos;## s access## ion ha## s to be postpone## d until Janu## ary 20## 08 , which does , in## de## ed , appear prob## able . 
con## sequent## ly , I vot## ed in favour of the report . 
. 
I should like Roman## ia to be in a position to conclude negoti## ations as s## oon as possible , with a view to sign## ing the EU Access## ion Treat## y . 
I welcome the rapporteur &apos;## s re## commend## ations and warn## ing## s . 
it is import## ant that the Roman## ian author## ities and the Roman## ian people are aware of the potent## ial s## tumbl## ing block## s of the access## ion process . 
let me point out , in particular , that safeguard clause## s can be implement## ed in the e## vent that Roman## ia fall## s well short of meet## ing conditio## ns and that access## ion can be postpone## d for one year if the is not be## ing implement## ed and the C## open## hagen political crite## ria are not be## ing com## plied with . 
I feel , how## ever , that s## uch warn## ing## s make no sense un## less the## y serve to encourag## e good behaviour and good perform## ance and n## ever to set im## possibly high thresh## old## s . 
I particular## ly agree with the rapporteur &apos;## s idea that the Commission must creat## e a per## man## ent mechan## ism to close## ly monitor and assist Roman## ia on this road and the Commission must , in my view , continu## e to provid## e Parliament with detail## ed inform## ation on how the country is progress## ing to## ward## s access## ion . 
the adopt## ion of this report is particular## ly time## ly , follow## ing the way in which the p## resident## ial elect## ions we## re conduct## ed in Roman## ia last Sunday . 
that conclude## s the ex## plan## ations of vot## e . 
I should like to welcome the delegation from the Assemb## ly of the K## ing## dom of Saudi Arab## ia , chair## ed by Mr Za## id bin Al @## -## @ Mu## h## s## in Al @## -## @ Hussein . 
the import## ance we attach to this visit , which is the first to the Chamber of the European Parliament since 19## 95 , should be emphasis## ed . 
this visit come## s at a ver## y significant moment , e## special## ly in view of the fact that Saudi Arab## ia will be holding it## s first local elect## ions in Fe## bru## ary 20## 05 . 
this visit constitut## es a new s## tage in the deepen## ing of relation## s between the Saudi people and the European Union . 
Mr President , we are ver## y pleas## ed about the holding of local elect## ions in Saudi Arab## ia , but ver## y much deplor## e the lack of particip## ation by women . 
I declare the s## itt## ing resum## ed . 
the Minute## s of yesterday &apos;## s s## itt## ing have be## en distribut## ed . 
are there any comment## s ? 
just two brief point## s , Mr President , the first of which ha## s to do with the vot## e on Tur## key . 
d## uring the vot## e on Tur## key - on the Eur## ling## s report - I vot## ed in favour of Mr Lang## en &apos;## s Amendment No 16 . 
that ha## s not , how## ever , be## en record## ed ; per## hap## s the machine was not work## ing . 
I would ask you to correct that . 
second## ly , we vot## ed yesterday on the EU @## -## @ Russia summit . 
in s## o do## ing , we s## aid that all sector## s of Chechen soci## ety should be integrate## d in## to the peace process . 
I have learn## ed today that the fami## ly of President Maskh## adov , who## s## e elect## ion took place under OS## CE super## vision , ha## s be## en abduct## ed and inter## ned by the Russia## n secret service## s . 
the## y include hi## s s## ib## ling## s , who are between 69 and 75 year## s of age . 
I would ask that you have this inform## ation verifi## ed and , if it prove## s to be accurate , protest to the Russia## n author## ities about this . 
your comment## s have be## en not## ed , Mr Po## s## s## elt . 
if there are no further comment## s , the Minute## s are approve## d . 
the next item is the debate on seven motion## s for re## solution## s on Zimbabwe . 
Mr President , Zimbabwe is a land of trage## dy and a land of tyrann## y . 
it is a country rich in natural resource## s and rich in the resource## s of it## s people . 
bo## th are be## ing devastate## d by the political tyrann## y of the Mugabe regime . 
people are suffer## ing from hung## er and health problem## s as a result of food and medical aid be## ing with## held from area## s that are cover## ed by the op## position part## ies . 
some 9 million people , 75 % of the Zimbabwe## an population , are now s## aid to be liv## ing be## low the p## over## ty line , but the World Food Pro## gramme is on## ly able to provid## e food for 1.6 million people this Dec## ember . 
that is the first reason why this is an urge## ncy . 
the second reason is that on 3 Mar## ch there is suppose## d to be an elect## ion in Zimbabwe . 
that elect## ion , on the present prospect## s , will be n## either free nor fair . 
it is not up to us to decide who the people of Zimbabwe should elect . 
that is entire## ly for them , but the## y must be free to elect whom## soever the## y wish . 
it is up to the neighbour## ing countries of Africa and to the Africa## n Union to make s## ure that international standard## s of demo## cracy pertain through## out Africa and through## out the country of Zimbabwe . 
it is up to the European Union to make s## ure that we support the monitor## ing of th## ose elect## ions , giving technical support and financial support , s## o that we can play our part in the international observ## er mission## s . 
that is also why it is an urge## ncy today . 
the thir## d reason is the in## toler## able attack on the lib## erty of Roy Ben## nett , one of the## ir member## s of parliament , a man who ha## s suffer## ed , who## s## e fami## ly ha## s suffer## ed and who## s## e workers have suffer## ed over the month## s . 
Mr Ben## nett push## ed a govern## ment minister be## cause he was making racial remark## s about Mr Ben## nett and hi## s fami## ly . 
he was th## en s## ent to prison , not by the court## s , but by a vot## e in the parliament bas## ed on the political division . 
I urge that the A## U and the EU act today to bring a semblance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe . 
Mr President , I have just return## ed from a privat## e visit to Zimbabwe . 
it is interest## ing to note that the situ## ation on the ground does not appear despe## rate . 
how## ever , accord## ing to the statistic## s , the situ## ation is prob## ably wor## s## e in other part## s of the country which I di## d not visit . 
when deba## ting s## uch countries as Zimbabwe , where human right## s are not even discuss## ed be## cause of fear of repress## ion , we must consider the right att## itude to take in order to try to influence the power## s that be . 
we know we are deal## ing with a regime that is not democratic , that ha## s take## n tri## ed to use al## most all it## s power## s to take away the democratic and fundamental right## s of part of it## s population . 
on the other hand , we have seen re## cent## ly that there is a sil## ver lining . 
the court## s , for in## stance , are striv## ing from a ver## y difficult position to try to retain some form of im## partial## ity . 
some## time## s I wonder whet## her a car## rot @## -## @ and @## -## @ s## tick policy might be more appropriate and more fruit## ful th## an just pass## ing motion## s of condemn## ation . 
we may pass this motion but what effect will it have ? 
ver## y li## ttle , I think , with a regime like Mugabe &apos;## s . 
we must start to think in different term## s if we are to be effective when deal## ing with a regime of this sort . 
Mr President , political oppress## ion in Zimbabwe cast## s a long shadow ; it is a cloud that lies over not on## ly th## ose liv## ing in Zimbabwe it## self but also th## ose who have left to seek asy## lum in Europe . 
in my constitue## ncy in the north @## -## @ east of Eng## land , there are Zimbabwe## an## s who fear summa## ry death if the## y are force## d to return to the## ir native land . 
I hope that Member State govern## ments like my own , which think it is safe for asy## lum @## -## @ seeker## s to be return## ed to Zimbabwe , will take note of the re## solution table## d here this afternoon and revise the## ir position . 
the situ## ation in Zimbabwe is get## ting wor## s## e , not better . 
on 9 Dec## ember 20## 04 , the No## n @## -## @ Govern## mental Organ## isation## s Act came in## to force . 
this Act ban## s foreign human right## s organisation## s and give## s the govern## ment power## s to inter## vene in the operation## s of any N## GO in Zimbabwe . 
mean## while , the qual## ity of life for Zimbabwe## an## s ha## s plummet## ed . 
life expect## ancy is now 35 year## s . 
Zimbabwe could be self @## -## @ sufficient in food , but last season it produce## d on## ly a thir## d of the ma## ize it need## s ; y## et the Mugabe regime is inter## fer## ing with the international distribut## ion of food . 
in the light of this deterior## ating situ## ation , it is high time to tighten up target## ed sanction## s again## st the regime . 
a final point : as we have heard , next Mar## ch Zimbabwe is due to hold a general elect## ion . 
there are worry## ing indic## ations that this elect## ion may not be held in free and fair conditio## ns . 
elector## al legisl## ation pass## ed ear## lier this month di## d not meet international democratic standard## s . 
good observ## ation of the elect## ions is going to be a vital part of ens## uring that the## y are free and fair . 
there## fore I hope that we in Parliament , and the Council and the Commission , will provid## e the maxim## um possible support for elect## ion @## -## @ observ## er mission## s at all level## s . 
Mr President , Madam President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Zimbabwe ha## s al## ways experience## d period## s of complex## ity and pro## found division , whet## her under colonial## ism , at the time of I## an Smith &apos;## s Uni## lateral De## clar## ation of In## depend## ence in 19## 65 and the ensu## ing UN embargo , d## uring the war of libera## tion from 19## 72 to 19## 78 and th## en , follow## ing in## depend## ence , in the first democratic elect## ions , which we## re won by Z## A## NU under Robert Mugabe . 
for me , though , as an East Germa## n , it is al## ways s## tri## king how often leader## s who take office full of lofty ideal## s th## en , s## o to s## peak , distance them## selves from the## ir own origin## al go## al## s and vision## s and take less and less account of the people &apos;## s interest## s the long## er the## y are in power . 
Zimbabwe does , of course , even today have mass## ive problem## s to contend with . 
I believ## e that the on## ly thing we can re## commend to Zimbabwe## an## s today is to look a## round them and see how the## ir neighbour## s have manage## d it - to look at what South Africa is do## ing , at what Namibia is do## ing , at how Angola and Moz## ambi## que are try## ing to establish a balance between the vari## ous vest## ed interest## s in the## ir countries . 
if there is to be peace , there must be an attempt at mutual understand## ing , with the use of peace## ful mean## s and every interest , even the most divers## e , take## n in## to account . 
Zimbabwe need## s land reform , but there are other ways of going about it . 
the European Union should not al## ways be , as it we## re , making re## commend## ations to all and s## un## dry on the bas## is of our value## s . 
ver## y often , that go## es wrong ; per## hap## s you all s## till recall the European Union &apos;## s staunch support for Russia &apos;## s President Yel## ts## in at a time when he was an alcohol## ic . 
in this actual in## stance , we can be confident that the SA## DC will have influence and find opportun## ities , and that the Africa## n Union can act to move thing## s forward . 
I am convince## d that we , if we support these countries in the## ir ef## fort## s to influence Zimbabwe , will be ver## y like## ly to be able to help the elect## ions schedul## ed for Mar## ch to be fair and democratic after all . 
- Mr President , the Mugabe regime &apos;## s strate## gy of forc## ing political opponent## s in## to line is continu## ing un## abate## d . 
for ex## ample , the Zimbabwe## an author## ities have force## d two news## paper## s express## ing critical view## s to close in the past 18 month## s . 
in add## ition , Mugabe &apos;## s support## ers have ma## de , and continu## e to make , life as difficult as possible for the op## position party , the Movement for Democrat## ic Change . 
un## doubt## ed## ly with a view to the approach## ing parliament## ary elect## ions in Mar## ch 20## 05 , the Mugabe regime is increas## ing the pressure on in## dependent organisation## s , judging by the No## n @## -## @ governmental Organ## isation## s Act adopt## ed in Har## are exact## ly a week ago . 
in futur## e , these s## hall no long## er be permit## ted to receiv## e any fund## ing from a## broad . 
if a Zimbabwe## an civil lib## er## ties or human right## s organisation ha## s s## o much as one foreign employ## ee on it## s staff , it is hence## forth term## ed foreign . 
pursu## ant to the new Act , foreign N## GO## s can## not be register## ed and will there## fore be ban## ned in the near futur## e . 
the aim of this new legisl## ation is clear . 
after all , numer## ous Zimbabwe## an civil lib## er## ties and human right## s organisation## s re## ly on foreign don## ations . 
it is obvi## ous that the intention of the Zimbabwe## an Govern## ment is to silence them . 
accord## ing to report## s , the N## GO## s concern## ed are un## will## ing to submit to the Govern## ment &apos;## s attempt to gag them . 
that is an extreme## ly courage## ous att## itude . 
the Council and the Commission will have the## ir work cut out to advis## e and assist them in this . 
. - Mr President , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , lad## ies and gentle## men , Zimbabwe is un## fortunate## ly one of the topic## s that figure most regular## ly , most frequent## ly , in these Thursday debate## s that we hold on press## ing human right## s problem## s . 
this tell## s us two thing## s : first## ly , that the situ## ation remain## s serious and , second## ly , that the measure## s that we have adopt## ed have not be## en work## ing . 
what we must first condemn is the destruct## ion of a country by an appal## ling author## itarian regime . 
as ha## s be## en mention## ed in this House , the p## over## ty statistic## s are increas## ing## ly shock## ing ; Zimbabwe us## ed to be a country that , if proper## ly manage## d , could not on## ly have f## ed it## s entire population , but could also have help## ed to solv## e the problem## s of hung## er and need on the Africa## n continent and in other part## s of the world . 
the Mugabe regime , how## ever , de## spite warn## ing## s from the EU and from further a## field , continu## es to increas## e political oppress## ion and we view the elect## ions schedul## ed for Mar## ch with great concern . 
either the country under## go## es a rapid transform## ation and offer## s even the s## light## est opportun## ity for debate or th## ose elect## ions will not be free and fair and one doubt## s whet## her it will even be worth observ## ing them . 
s## uch is the case of Roy Ben## n## ette , of persecut## ion perpet## rated again## st Tsvangirai after hi## s visit to this House , of the negat## ive influence - and I wish to draw your attention to this - that the regime can have in the region , where regime## s can cho## ose to follow the path of demo## cracy or to slip back in## to author## itarian## ism . 
I was re## cent## ly in Moz## ambi## que , for ex## ample , where elect## ions have be## en taking place . 
the count ha## s y## et to be complete## d . 
we be## came aware , how## ever , that d## uring the elect## ion campaign Moz## ambi## can vot## ers vot## ed a## broad and that op## position part## ies - th## ose oppose## d to FR## EL## IM## O - we## re persecut## ed in Zimbabwe . 
the conditio## ns are in place , how## ever . 
Zimbabwe &apos;## s desti## ny can decisive## ly contribut## e to## ward## s con## solid## ating the demo## cracy that we hope for in the region , follow## ing the ex## ample of South Africa , there## by con## solid## ating democratic aspi## rations in Moz## ambi## que and Angola . 
it may , on the other hand , represent a step back## ward## s in## to form## s of author## itarian## ism . 
I wish to point out that we have put increas## ing pressure on neighbour## ing countries and that we have develop## ed dia## logue with the Africa## n Union . 
this demonst## rates the import## ant role that that organisation ha## s to play in exert## ing it## s form of pressure on Mugabe &apos;## s appal## ling regime . 
. - Mr President , the Zimbabwe## an## s are a strong people , and Zimbabwe is a strong country . 
follow## ing in## depend## ence , it was also an economic## ally prom## ising country . 
it is sad to see that a## round 60 % of the population is current## ly in financial cris## is and frequent## ly live## s be## low the p## over## ty line . 
that clear## ly say## s some## thing about the administ## ration of the country and what ha## s gradual## ly gone wrong with it . 
the sad thing is that Mugabe and the Z## A## NU @## -## @ PF party , particular## ly Mugabe &apos;## s inner circl## e , are the perpet## rator## s . 
there are man## y in the Z## A## NU @## -## @ PF party , of course , who are ver## y well aware of the need for out## side help , of the need for the econom## y to develop in a different direct## ion , if the country is to surviv## e . 
we know that neighbour## ing countries have produce## d man## y inform## al contact## s and endeavour## s to achiev## e a solution , and I think that it is precise## ly with these that the opportun## ities for the European Union lie . 
with the support of the Africa## n Union , the New Partner## ship for Africa &apos;## s Develop## ment ( N## EPA## D ) , President Mbeki and all the other contact## s , we must increas## e the pressure , be## cause it is on## ly via the Africa## n rout## e and the European Union &apos;## s connect## ion with this that we stand a chance of achiev## ing any kind of result . 
there is no doubt that the Mar## ch elect## ions have large## ly fall## en in## to and be## en shape## d by the wrong hand## s al## read## y , and it will be ver## y difficult to make them fair and open . 
this render## s observ## ation close to point## less . 
n## ever## the## less , it is in that democratic process and in civil soci## ety that strength is to be found . 
that strength is s## till great in Zimbabwe , s## till non @## -## @ viol## ent and s## till orient## ed to## ward## s peace and democratic solution## s . 
I hope that , by us## ing s## mart sanction## s , by taking the path that we , the European Union , are taking , and in consult## ation with th## ose other countries , we s## hall do our ut## most to take that democratic step there . 
the alter## native path , blood## shed , offer## s no prospect## s . 
I sincere## ly hope that we can use all our diploma## tic mean## s to increas## e the pressure to s## uch a degree that Mugabe is surround## ed by people who set the domin## o## es fall## ing . 
this is necess## ary if the democratic path is to stand a chance of success there . 
in## de## ed , it is my hope that Europe will make full use of all the mean## s at it## s dispos## al to this end . 
. - Mr President , a leg## acy of colonial South## ern Rhode## s## ia is that much of the Zimbabwe## an farm## land is in the hand## s of a small group of farm## ers of European origin . 
my group support## s the wish## es of the black major## ity of the population for the return of most of the land to them . 
un## fortunate## ly , that wish is be## ing serious## ly abuse## d by Robert Mugabe , the man o## nce popular as the leader of the success## ful war of libera## tion again## st the colonial occupier## s and the racist minor## ity Govern## ment of I## an Smith . 
it was not until the elector## ate had al## most lo## st it## s trust in him that he ma## de the long @## -## @ promise## d land reform a priorit## y . 
for Mugabe , the expropri## ation of large farm## s is now principal## ly an instrument to reward hi## s old follow## ing of free## dom fighter## s at last after deca## de## s of delay . 
s## till more , it form## s part of a campaign to eliminate political opponent## s by mean## s of s## lur## s , intimid## ation and coerc## ion . 
if Europe isolate## s this regime , it must do s## o not on the bas## is of old colonial interest## s and old colonial arrog## ance , but be## cause we want to help every country in the world promot## e human right## s and demo## cracy . 
that is what this is all about . 
- Every nation ha## s the right and respons## ibility to resolv## e it## s political problem## s and no @## -## @ one , let al## one the European Union , Brit## ain or the Unit## ed State## s of America , ha## s the cred## ent## ial## s to inter## vene political## ly , economic## ally or militari## ly either in Zimbabwe or in any other country . 
it is precise## ly be## cause the people of Zimbabwe manage## d , through huge , blood## y battle## s , to gain the## ir in## depend## ence from Brit## ain and be## cause the## y are claim## ing the## ir land , the rich## est part of which s## till belong## s to foreign## ers - main## ly Brit## ons - as a result of colonial## ism , that a new plan of intervention is be## ing prepar## ed , the aim of which is to turn Zimbabwe in## to a modern colon## y . 
on the pre## text of any problem## s which exist , most of which are due to long @## -## @ term delay## s as a result of colonial## ism , the govern## ments of Brit## ain and other countries are bank## roll## ing the op## position , the leader of which , it should be not## ed , is accus## ed of the attempt## ed murder of the elect## ed p## resident . 
a network of s## o @## -## @ call## ed &apos; non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s &apos; is be## ing set up , most of which are front organisation## s which have nothing to do with the grass @## -## @ root## s and social move## ment ; the## y are there to prepar## e the ground for intervention . 
for the Communist Part## y of Greece , this motion is un## accept## able ; even the accus## ation of arm## s trad## ing by Brit## ish age## nts ha## s be## en withdraw## n . 
the sanction## s must stop . 
we need to support the people of Zimbabwe in the## ir fight to maintain the## ir in## depend## ence from neo @## -## @ colonial## ism . 
. Mr President , we in the Commission understand and take a ver## y serious view of the prepar## ations for the elect## ions in Mar## ch 20## 05 . 
the Commission reiterate## s it## s attach## ment to the holding of free and fair elect## ions in that country . 
the re## cent introdu## ction by the govern## ment of Zimbabwe of a set of elector## al reform## s which are current## ly under discuss## ion in the Zimbabwe## an parliament is an import## ant step . 
it will have to be assess## ed whet## her this will lead to a genuine in## corpo## ration in## to domestic elector## al legisl## ation of the South## ern Africa## n Develop## ment Comm## un## ity ( SA## DC ) principle## s and guide## line## s govern## ing democratic elect## ions , as un## anim## ously agree## d in the SA## DC Summit in Mau## rit## ius last August . 
the Commission remain## s deep## ly concern## ed about the current political and human right## s situ## ation and the respect for fundamental free## dom## s which at this s## tage would hard## ly allow for free and fair elect## ions . 
a specific matter of concern is the approval by the Zimbabwe## an parliament , on 9 Dec## ember , of the N## GO Bill , which heav## ily restrict## s N## GO## s &apos; room for action and activities . 
the Commission fully support## s the propos## ed EU in Har## are and other SA## DC capital## s as well as the issu## ing of an EU decla## ration express## ing concern## s regard## ing the implic## ations of the bill . 
the Commission is also worri## ed about the risk of politic## isation of the distribut## ion of food aid , main## ly in the con## text of the up## coming parliament## ary elect## ions . 
in the e## vent of clear ver## ification of partisan use , the Commission , together with it## s partner## s , including the W## FP , may have to envi## s## age suspend## ing food aid operation## s . 
after the Mar## ch elect## ions the Commission will reassess the situ## ation . 
any lift## ing or easing of EU measure## s again## st Zimbabwe can## not be just## ified at this s## tage . 
the Commission is aware of the de## liberate attempt## s by the Zimbabwe## an author## ities to under## mine the vis## a ban &apos;## s cred## ibility by multi## ply## ing the## ir travel## s to Europe and ha## s al## ways advoc## ated a strict application of the exempt## ions provid## ed for in the Council common position of 19 Fe## bru## ary 20## 04 . 
the Commission will continu## e to explore all a## venue## s to influence the govern## ment of Zimbabwe and to pursu## e an enhance## d political dia## logue with neighbour## ing SA## DC countries , not## ably South Africa . 
continu## ed international pressure on Zimbabwe and e## special## ly regional peer pressure is necess## ary . 
the vot## e will take place this afternoon , after the debate## s . 
the debate is closed . 
the next item is the debate on six motion## s for re## solution## s on the situ## ation in the east of the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go . 
Mr President , compar## ison## s can be drawn between Con## go &apos;## s present situ## ation and that of Germa## ny d## uring the Thirty Year## s &quot; War - a large country in the middle of a continent broken up , with vari## ous group## s ally## ing them## selves with an as## sort## ment of neighbour## ing power## s , and deca## de## s with## out peace . 
that is precise## ly what ha## s be## en going on in Con## go for deca## de## s , with people dy## ing in the## ir million## s , vast stretch## es of land ly## ing waste , and the econom## y cripp## led . 
as was the case in the after## math of the Thirty Year## s &quot; War , there will be no re## solution un## less - as happen## ed with the religious group## s th## en - the ethnic group## s can be br## ought in## to a peace process that also involve## s all the neighbour## ing states . 
that is why we see it as import## ant that mass## ive pressure should be br## ought to bear on the states border## ing this country of great lake## s , and e## special## ly on Rwanda , in order that it may bring st## ability o## nce and for all and may be deter## red from active intervention in Con## go , which is al## read## y suffer## ing s## o much . 
we will not , how## ever , succeed in that by word## s al## one , and s## o Mr Lang## en and I have start## ed to develop a holistic strate## gy which final## ly inter## link## s economic policy , foreign policy and development policy . 
word## s al## one will be no use to us in this situ## ation ; Europe will be able to use it## s weight on## ly if it make## s simultaneous and strategic use of the economic , political and diploma## tic opt## ions avail## able to it and re## ally get## s active## ly involve## d in this peace process . 
Commission## er , you might well ask your## self what the use is of having this debate on a Thursday afternoon in a Chamber that is not exact## ly full . 
I can re## member a time when this House debate## d how Lithuania could become more th## an a colon## y subject to Soviet oppress## ion , and today we have a Lithuania## n Commission## er in our mid## st . 
of that I am glad , and I am s## ure that you are well able to hand## le this issue of peace and human right## s in Con## go . 
Mr President , the conflict in the Democrat## ic Republic of the Con## go is the most lethal since the Second World War . 
the Inter## national R## escue Committee reckon## s that 3.## 8 million people have now be## en kill## ed and over a million of th## ose are child## ren . 
apart from th## ose kill## ed , 3.4 million have be## en displace## d . 
Con## go## les## e and foreign milit## ary group## s continu## e to use viol## ence to conceal the plunder## ing of gold , timber , iv## ory , tin and other natural resource## s . 
mean## while , the fr## agile and ineffectual transit## ional Con## go## les## e govern## ment stumble## s from political s## tale## mate to milit## ary cris## is . 
bo## th the transit## ional govern## ment and it## s international partner## s have fail## ed to deal with the root cause## s of the conflict . 
natural resource exploit## ation ha## s fund## ed and fuel## led the inst## ability in the country and , in## de## ed , ha## s fuel## led inst## ability and viol## ence in the Con## go for over a hundred year## s . 
what should have be## en a bless## ing to that country ha## s turn## ed out to be a source of deep sad## ness and regret and , in## de## ed , a curse . 
the Con## go &apos;## s natural wealth ha## s be## en a source of privat## e fund## ing for milit## ary and political elit## es in## stead of benefit## ing the vast major## ity of the Con## go## les## e population . 
our re## solution right## ly call## s for a package of measure## s to tackle this situ## ation . 
we must take action to ensu## re respect for the arm## s embargo ; the UN Security Council must impose sanction## s , travel restrict## ions , a ban on financial service## s , et## cetera , on individual## s who have particip## ated in the pill## aging of Con## go## les## e asset## s ; the EU and it## s Member State## s must act again## st comp## an## ies involve## d in exploit## ation ; we need a peace## keeping force in the east of the country ; and action must be take## n to disarm all illegal## ly arm## ed group## s . 
on## ly if s## uch measure## s are take## n can we hold out any hope that the elect## ions due next year will make any differ## ence to the tragi## c situ## ation in that country . 
the problem in the Con## go is n## either ethnic nor racial . 
it is about economic## s , and on## ly if we tackle economic## s will we solv## e the problem## s . 
Mr President , I s## peak in place of Mr Van Hecke , who ha## s had to leave Strasbourg ear## ly as he is travel## ling to the Democrat## ic Republic of the Con## go tomor## row . 
the current situ## ation in eastern Con## go show## s that the Con## go## les## e peace process is s## till ver## y fr## agile . 
in## de## ed , there have be## en report## s of new exchange## s of fire yesterday . 
the AL## DE Group warm## ly welcome## d the initiative to draft an urge## ncy re## solution on the Con## go . 
ultimate## ly , how## ever , our group decide## d not to endorse the compromis## e re## solution . 
we feel that the compromis## e text fail## s to ident## ify the core problem of the continu## ing inst## ability in the region and of the difficult relation## ship between the Democrat## ic Republic of the Con## go and it## s neighbour## ing countries , e## special## ly Rwanda . 
the issue is this : since the end of the Rwanda## n gen## ocide in 19## 94 a large group of extremis## t Hutu## s have be## en hid## ing in a remote area of the Con## go## les## e rain## forest in the east of the Con## go . 
after all these year## s the## y have s## till not be## en disarm## ed . 
the pre## s## ence of these heav## ily arm## ed militia## s is a const## ant threat to the peace process in the Democrat## ic Republic of the Con## go and to securit## y in the entire Great Lake## s region . 
the massacre at the Burundi## an refuge## e camp of Ga## tum## ba last August was on## ly one in a long s## eries of provocative action## s . 
M## ON## UC , the UN Peace## keeping Miss## ion in the Con## go , was suppose## d to disarm and neutral## ise the rebel## s , but ha## s fail## ed to do s## o . 
al## though M## ON## UC &apos;## s mandate ha## s be## en strength## ened and there are extra troop## s , the## y are poor## ly train## ed and there is a serious lack of inform## ation and technical assist## ance . 
we feel that the joint re## solution does not acknowledg## e that if Rwanda is cross## ing the border in## to the Con## go to put an end to the activity of the arm## ed gang## s , it is happen## ing in the con## text of M## ON## UC having fail## ed to do the disarm## ing . 
we would suggest that the European Union and the Member State## s need to get more active## ly involve## d in the DRC and the Great Lake## s region , focus## ing ver## y much on rapid dis## armament of the rebel force## s . 
per## hap## s European troop## s could be us## ed to strength## en the UN peace## keeping force## s . 
the troop## s from Pakistan , Nepal , Uruguay and other countries that are in the Con## go at the moment simpl## y do not have en## ough experience with milit## ary operation## s in sub @## -## @ Sahara## n Africa . 
Europe ha## s that experience . 
we have to consider all the opt## ions in order to make dis## armament happen . 
it is by far the most import## ant pre## requisite to get the peace process back on track . 
in summa## ry , we feel that al## though the re## solution ha## s man## y point## s that we support , it is un## balance## d . 
s## o , with regret , I will abstain . 
Mr President , my Group welcome## s the opportun## ity to discuss the current situ## ation in the DRC , but like other## s deep## ly regret## s the need to come back to this . 
in the report on asy## lum and sustain## able solution## s that Parliament adopt## ed yesterday , one of the thing## s we agree## d was that the European Union &apos;## s common foreign policy and common securit## y policy need## ed to focus on conflict re## solution and prevent## ion , pay## ing special attention to long @## -## @ term conflict situ## ations . 
this is exact## ly what we have in the DRC where , as ha## s al## read## y be## en point## ed out , the desir## e to control natural resource## s play## s an absolut## e## ly key role in the mass## ive displace## ments of people and in the mass## ive number## s of death## s . 
we stress the need for an effective mean## s of arm## s control and an effective dis## armament programme to be put in place . 
we would also endorse the call ma## de for the UN to deal with th## ose profit## eering from the pillage of natural resource## s , not least through the free## z## ing of bank account## s and action## s again## st comp## an## ies . 
we feel perfect## ly able to do this in the case of what we believ## e to be terrorist organisation## s , but seem total## ly in## cap## able of do## ing it with th## ose who cause mass## ive number## s of death## s else## where in the world . 
we also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN Department of Peace @## -## @ Keep## ing Ope## rations ha## s set up a special investig## ative team to look at the case## s of sexual abuse and exploit## ation perpet## rated by some of it## s own member## s in the UN organ## ising mission in the DRC , particular## ly in B## un## ia . 
we know , since this Parliament ha## s discuss## ed it on man## y occasion## s , that rape is us## ed as a mean## s to de## moral## ise opponent## s by demonst## rating the people can## not even protect the## ir own fami## lies . 
this Parliament ha## s recognis## ed on man## y occasion## s that victim## s of rape , child victim## s of s## ex abuse , are particular## ly vulner## able . 
s## o we consider it despi## cable that s## uch crime## s are also be## ing commit## ted by th## ose s## ent to protect an al## read## y traumat## ised population . 
we look for the perpet## rator## s to be br## ought to justice , as well as th## ose profit## eering from the trage## dy in the DRC . 
. - Mr President , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , lad## ies and gentle## men , the situ## ation in the Great Lake## s and in particular in the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go , is an ul## cer , a volcano in the heart of Africa that is , sad## ly , al## ways li## able to erupt . 
follow## ing a conflict that , d## uring it## s six year## s , claim## ed three million live## s , but that continu## es to claim 31## .000 live## s every month , accord## ing to the Inter## national R## escue Committee , the sign## s are that the situ## ation remain## s un## s## table and un## fortunate## ly extreme## ly un## predict## able . 
the AC## P @## -## @ EU joint parliament## ary assemb## ly re## cent## ly met in The Ha## gue . 
our meet## ing open## ed , curi## ously , with the good news of the Dar @## -## @ es @## -## @ Salam Con## ference and of the commit## ment ma## de there by all Head## s of Govern## ment to end the conflict . 
by Thursday , how## ever , when we end## ed the meet## ing , our joint Chair## man , Glen## y## s Kin## nock , had br## ought us the sad news that the Rwanda## n arm## y had cross## ed the border in## to the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go . 
we must there## fore be more effective in this area in order to stabilis## e the region . 
Mr Po## s## s## elt &apos;## s compar## ison with the Thirty Year## s &quot; War was most apt and I hope that he is right , be## cause if s## o the conflict will come to an end and th## ose region## s of the Africa## n continent will be as prosper## ous , s## table and modern as Germa## ny is today . 
this is what we striv## e for . 
the Africa## n continent must be stabilis## ed in open and democratic soci## e## ties . 
what must we do in this House ? 
we must acknowledg## e that we are not do## ing en## ough as regard## s the militia## s of the former govern## ment of Rwanda . 
the## y are a source of inst## ability and an excus## e for per## man## ent inst## ability in the east of the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go and we must take strong## er action to disarm them . 
we must make it clear that any invas## ion is un## accept## able and that respect for a country &apos;## s border## s is a principle that must be appli## ed by all countries in the region . 
we must complete the democratic transform## ation of the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go and do what we can to stabilis## e the country ; the Con## go## les## e arm## y must be re## un## ified , for ex## ample . 
we must strength## en the resource## s avail## able to the Unit## ed Nation## s &quot; mission in order to guarantee genuine peace and st## ability in the east of the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go and to succeed in creat## ing conditio## ns on the ground that do not take us back## ward## s ; in other word## s , conditio## ns that lead all side## s to honour the 20## 03 peace agree## ments , that lead all side## s to honour agree## ments under## take## n in Tanzania on 20 N## ov## ember of this year and that lead all side## s du## ly to comp## ly with Unit## ed Nation## s Security Council re## solution## s . 
. a## mong## st the man## y ex## ample## s of viol## ation of human right## s and democratic principle## s in Africa , the involve## ment of child## ren in arm## ed conflict## s stand## s out as an extreme## ly serious problem . 
I wonder whet## her any debate , even one held in this House , can help to counter p## over## ty in develop## ing countries . 
over 5 billion people in s## uch countries live on one or two dollar## s a day , and a blood## y child## ren &apos;## s war is be## ing f## ought in Con## go , where over 3## 00## .000 child## ren are fight## ing in milit## ary intervention## s which have kill## ed more th## an 3 million people in re## cent year## s . 
does s## uch destruct## ion of child## hood through enforce## d labour , recruit## ment to the arm## ed force## s and sexual exploit## ation not demonst## rate lack of respons## ibility and fail## ure on the part of the vari## ous human## itarian and international organisation## s ? 
in order to take measure## s to prevent trage## dies of this kind , it is necess## ary to begin by ident## ifying the## ir cause## s . 
the most fundamental of these is the long @## -## @ term and wide @## -## @ rang## ing exploit## ation of develop## ing countries by a number of world power## s , including European countries . 
the latter profit from s## uch exploit## ation while the loot## ed colon## ies are left even poor## er . 
Con## go is devastate## d , having become the victim of exploit## ers for whom the country &apos;## s abundant natural resource## s are more import## ant th## an human live## s . 
I believ## e that a person &apos;## s level of civil## isation should be measur## ed in term## s of how respons## ible the## ir att## itude is to the weak## est , and the same is tru## e for th## ose in power . 
y## et the weak## est a## mong us should not be provid## ed with aid that is mer## e## ly a s## ham , and take## s the form of moral de## vast## ation , contra## ception and abort## ion . 
much more is need## ed . 
comprehens## ive care should be provid## ed , and development facilit## ated . 
in add## ition , mal## aria , tube## rculosis and AIDS , which are pre## valent in the country , should be treat## ed , and fami## ly unit## s help## ed to develop sound## ly . 
I also believ## e that in## stead of s## end## ing arm## ed force## s and instruct## ors to Iraq , we should take step## s to ensu## re that peace final## ly prevail## s in Con## go . 
. Mr President , the European Commission share## s the concern## s of Parliament about the increas## ing tension## s between Rwanda and the Democrat## ic Republic of Con## go and the## ir con## sequenc## es for the human right## s situ## ation in the region . 
in## de## ed , we are ver## y concern## ed by the threat## s of Rwanda to use force again## st the territorial integ## rity of the Con## go in order to neutral## ise the ex @## -## @ F## AR and Inter## a## ham## we troop## s , and by the multi## ple report## s of milit## ary operation## s by the Rwanda## n arm## y in the eastern Con## go . 
the human## itarian cris## is that these action## s generate is an additional reason for our concern . 
it is essential to the st## ability of the region that Rwanda withdraw## s with## out delay any force## s it may have in the ter## rit## ory of the DRC , and refrain from any action or statement that contra## vene## s international law . 
the European Commission is deep## ly convince## d that until the problem of the pre## s## ence of ex @## -## @ F## AR element## s in the eastern DRC is definitive## ly solv## ed , it will under## mine peace and securit## y in the region , be a source of inst## ability and a threat to civil## ian population## s . 
in this con## text , the European Commission is convince## d that the local govern## ment should make use of exist## ing mechan## ism## s , including the Jo## int Ver## ification Mechan## ism and the Tri## partite Commission , to find a peace## ful solution . 
further## more , the Con## go should implement with## out delay it## s plan , establish## ed with the support of the Unit## ed Nation## s Organ## isation &apos;## s Miss## ion in the Democrat## ic Republic of the Con## go ( M## ON## UC ) , aim## ed at accele## rating the dis## armament and de## mobil## isation of foreign arm## ed group## s . 
it should also speed up the integration and the train## ing of it## s national arm## y in order to effective## ly disarm the ex @## -## @ F## AR militia## s . 
in## de## ed , the establish## ment of peace and securit## y in the region through bring## ing together the countries is our priorit## y . 
in this con## text , we see the re## solution of the ex @## -## @ F## AR issue as essential and in## es## cap## able . 
the Comm## un## ity is active## ly support## ing the Con## go## les## e author## ities in the re## construct## ion of the country through development project## s for an over## all amount of EUR 0.## 5 billion . 
the European Union is and remain## s the large## st human## itarian aid don## or in Con## go and will continu## e it## s assist## ance . 
thank you , Commission## er . 
the vot## e will take place after the debate## s . 
the debate is closed . 
the next item is the## debate on six motion## s for re## solution## s on Bhopal . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , in today &apos;## s debate we are discuss## ing issue## s we do not usual## ly touch upon . 
the issue## s we general## ly debate are import## ant , but the## y relate to financial perspective## s , communic## ations solution## s and economic matter## s . 
these are all extreme## ly import## ant issue## s , but the## y are not tragi## c . 
the three item## s on the age## nda for today &apos;## s afternoon debate , and in particular the thir## d item on Bhopal , concern one of the great## est trage## dies to have occur## red d## uring the past few deca## de## s . 
this item relate## s to a trage## dy in which a gas explosion cause## d the im## mediate death of sever## al ten## s of thousand## s of people . 
the con## sequenc## es of this explosion are un## fortunate## ly s## till be## ing felt today . 
the institution## s and person## s to be name## d short## ly are respons## ible for this sad state of affair## s . 
the organisation## s which are to blame for what happen## ed have admitted the## ir guilt , as the## y have paid out compens## ation for the death## s of 1## 5.2## 48 people . 
the## y have also paid out compens## ation to 55## 4.8## 95 individual## s who have fall## en ill or become dis## able## d , whi## lst attempt## ing to pay s## uch compens## ation to as few people as possible . 
broad estimate## s suggest that over 1## 00## .000 people have suffer## ed as a result of the gas explosion in Bhopal 25 year## s ago , and million## s are s## till suffer## ing to this day due to environment## al poll## ution . 
what happen## ed in the after## math of the e## vent ? 
follow## ing an agree## ment and vari## ous court ruling## s , the guilt## y party , Union Car## bi## de Corp## oration In## dia , paid out US## D 4## 70 million in compens## ation . 
this would appear to be no mean s## um , but the victim## s of the explosion receiv## ed less th## an 10 % of the money . 
the rest w## ent to the lawyer## s . 
in pass## ing , it is worth not## ing that even in Dick## ens &quot; tale## s of 1## 50 year## s ago , in which he enjoy## ed describ## ing predator## y lawyer## s , there are no in## stance## s of a victim receiv## ing vi## rtual## ly nothing . 
the money vanish## ed , be## cause in add## ition to pay## ing the lawyer## s &quot; fee## s , large amount## s we## re alleg## ed## ly us## ed to pay off corrupt official## s . 
it is in## toler## able that every## one ha## s ma## de money from this trage## dy except it## s victim## s . 
we are witness## es to a con## s## piracy , and action must be take## n to put thing## s right . 
this is the aim of the motion for a re## solution we are to adopt today . 
we must endeavour to reassess the damage , s## o that compens## ation is paid to th## ose entitle## d to it . 
we must ensu## re that bodies are appoint## ed which can resolv## e this problem fair## ly . 
Mr President , today we re## member one of the wor## st industrial disaster## s in histo## ry . 
as we have heard , in the dead of night on 2 Dec## ember 19## 84 , a dead## ly 40 ton## nes of known and un## known poison## s leak## ed in## to the air . 
the people of Bhopal tri## ed to escape the poison## ous cloud . 
the## ir ef## fort## s we## re , how## ever , fu## tile and near## ly 4 000 people died instantaneous## ly ; to d## ate 25 000 innoc## ent people have died . 
these are the bare brutal fact## s and today the people of Bhopal are s## till suffer## ing from this horr## ifying leg## acy . 
that is why we can## not just re## member , but must act as a communit## y to help an## other . 
we need to ask why after 20 year## s the pur## suit of justice ha## s be## en s## o difficult for the surviv## ors . 
we need to ask why the trans## national corpo## ration involve## d den## ies any continu## ing li## ability , either for the state of the Bhopal site or the victim## s &apos; health . 
we need to ask why the site ha## s not be## en clean## ed of toxic waste and continu## es to pollute the water the surround## ing communit## ies re## ly on . 
we need to know just how Dow Chem## ical## s can close the door on what was one of the wor## st industrial disaster## s in this cent## ury . 
we also need to ask why s## o man## y people are s## till await## ing adequate compens## ation . 
I appreci## ate the issue of compens## ation is mir## ed in end## less argument## s as to the calcul## ations , but this is not a sufficient reason for the people of Bhopal to have to re## live the experience day after day . 
whi## lst I support the major part of the re## solution and the sentiment be## hind it , I do not believ## e the propos## ed amend## ments add any## thing construct## ive to this re## solution . 
it is vital when we talk about disaster## s s## uch as Bhopal that we do not descend in## to polemic## s and irrational## ity . 
the al## location of blame is all too often mis## plac## ed and we often condemn all age## nts with## out establish## ing all the fact## s . 
as chair of Parliament &apos;## s South @## -## @ Asia SA## A## RC delegation , I would urge you to keep all these matter## s in perspective , and the budget of e## ach country is particular## ly relev## ant . 
we must recognis## e the limit## ation of certain countries , which may not y## et have develop## ed the technologies or know @## -## @ how to deal with s## uch disaster## s as quick## ly and as safe## ly as we have come to expect in our own countries . 
we must also attempt to see e## ach angle of an issue s## uch as the Bhopal disaster , and we should acknowledg## e the work that ha## s al## read## y be## en done by the Indian Govern## ment and the M## adh## ya Pra## de## sh Govern## ment with regard to medical care , economic and social assist## ance , environment## al clean @## -## @ up , and final## ly financial compens## ation . 
this short list go## es to prove that a lot of work ha## s al## read## y be## en done . 
I feel it would be un## productive to vil## ify a govern## ment that ha## s ma## de ef## fort## s to reme## dy and address the ple## thora of problem## s stemm## ing from Bhopal . 
ra## ther , we need to employ all our diploma## tic ef## fort## s to keep the pressure on the Indian Govern## ment to maintain it## s current ef## fort## s in provid## ing compens## ation and work## ing on detox## ification of the area . 
n## ever## the## less , if we demand that action is take## n and money is spent , we should also be prepar## ed to help in any way we can , including offer## ing technical and financial support . 
we must not condemn with## out first examin## ing what we , as a communit## y , can do to help . 
we should continu## e to be construct## ive and offer the human## itarian , eco## logical and medical expert## ise we have to the Govern## ment of M## adh## ya Pra## de## sh . 
this is a role for the Commission , Member State## s and govern## ments a## like . 
I would urge you , there## fore , to pressure all th## ose who can bring any relief to th## ose who have al## read## y suffer## ed in Bhopal . 
Mr President , while Dow Chem## ical## s and the Indian Govern## ment argue over who is to blame for the Bhopal disaster , the people continu## e to suffer and di## e from the## ir two @## -## @ deca## de leg## acy . 
more th## an 7 000 people died with## in days , but in## action ha## s seen 15 000 further death## s which could have be## en avoid## ed . 
even today , 20 year## s on , n## either side seem## s to care about the suffer## ing , on## ly about the## ir re## put## ations . 
as man## y as 1## 00 000 people are suffer## ing chronic and debilit## ating ill## ness## es , with 10 to 15 people a month continu## ing to di## e . 
the surviv## ors s## till wait for justice : compens## ation and medical assist## ance in man## y case## s . 
the plant site , which continu## es to pollute , will cost an estimate## d GBP 15 million to de## commission , compar## ed with Dow &apos;## s year## ly sale## s of GBP 16 billion and In## dia &apos;## s G## DP of GBP 3## 20 billion . 
the Indian Govern## ment ha## s also y## et to spend US## D 3## 30 million of the origin## al compens## ation give## n to them by Union Car## bi## de . 
the poll## ution in the water supply in near## by s## lum## s is also 500 time## s above the maxim## um re## commend## ed W## HO level## s . 
how can the international communit## y , a multi## national comp## any and one of the world &apos;## s main countries , stand by and watch this happen ? 
just now it should not be about who is to blame , but who is going to stop the suffer## ing . 
Bhopal resident , Abd## ul Ja## b## bar Khan , who run## s the Bhopal Women Gas Vi## ctims &apos; Industri## al Associ## ation , s## aid in the Guard## ian news## paper in the UK : &apos; in New York after 9 / 11 there was compens## ation , punish## ment and clean @## -## @ up in just a few month## s . 
in Bhopal , after 20 year## s , we have nothing . &apos; 
- Mr President , since colonial time## s , the countries of the develop## ing world have be## en supply## ing cheap product## s from the agri## cultural , min## ing and small @## -## @ scale craft sector## s to rich countries . 
the## y re## ly on the rich countries in the North for import## s of expensive product## s bas## ed on new industrial technology . 
that make## s these countries extreme## ly dependent on import## s and export## s and result## s in a trade balance ver## y un## favour## able to them . 
just like the time when European countries exert## ed administ## rative power through milit## ary force , this distribut## ion is s## till lead## ing to per## man## ent p## over## ty and under## development in the Develop## ing World . 
it is e## asy to see , th## en , why the govern## ments of these countries thought that all new indus## tries we## re to the## ir advantage , in particular large @## -## @ scale metal and chemical## s indus## tries . 
these countries had held li## ttle attract## ion for this kind of indus## try in the past , not on## ly be## cause the work## force was s## till in## sufficient## ly train## ed , but chief## ly be## cause most custom## ers we## re in rich## er part## s of the world and transport## ing finish## ed product## s was expensive . 
the on## ly indus## try that took root origin## ated from State @## -## @ own## ed enter## prise## s or serv## ed on## ly the local market and the tour## ists . 
the need for strong## er indus## try in these countries was and is abuse## d by indus## tries from the rich North be## cause , al## though these indus## tries want to expand , the southern countries are s## till not ver## y import## ant as market## s whi## lst the## ir pur## cha## s## ing power remain## s low . 
invest## ment in the South does become an attract## ive prospect for them , how## ever , if wage## s are low and , in particular , if environment## al and safety require## ments there are less exact## ing or ver## y poor## ly monitor## ed . 
this make## s it possible for disaster## s in which man## y people suffer incur## able ill## ness or lose the## ir live## s to occur . 
this danger threaten## s not on## ly the employ## ees of th## ose enter## prise## s but also the people liv## ing in the neighbour## hood . 
where disaster## s do happen , enter## prise## s are not will## ing to bear the cost## s . 
the gas explosion twen## ty year## s ago in Bhopal and the way in which this was deal## t with have a great deal to do with this . 
n## either Union Car## bi## de nor Dow Chem## ical nor the Indian Govern## ment are will## ing to produce sufficient compens## ation for the 20## .000 or more people kill## ed , for more th## an 1## 00## .000 people left with per## man## ent injur## ies , or for clean## ing up the contamin## ation of s## oil and ground water . 
a solution must be found , and disaster## s of this nature must n## ever happen again . 
let us European## s take our respons## ibility , let us join in making payment## s if necess## ary , and most import## ant## ly let us lay down rule## s to ensu## re that this kind of error is not repeat## ed by European enter## prise## s . 
Mr President , 20 year## s have pass## ed since toxic gas escape## d from a fertil## iser plant in Bhopal . non## e## the## less , it## s harm## ful effect## s and environment## al poll## ution are s## till affect## ing the live## s of thousand## s of individual## s . 
this leak kill## ed over 7## .000 people d## uring the night of 2 to 3 Dec## ember 19## 84 . 
a further 15## .000 people died later as a result of it . 
the leak is also respons## ible for chronic ill## ness## es affect## ing more th## an 1## 00## .000 people . 
the Indian Govern## ment and Union Car## bi## de or Dow Chem## ical , the current owner of the fertil## iser plant , have assume## d respons## ibility for the impact of the accident on the live## s of thousand## s of people and the environment . 
as stated in the re## solution the House is to vot## e on today , an in## dependent investig## ation of the current situ## ation in Bhopal must be car## ried out . this could be under## take## n under the au## spice## s of the Unit## ed Nation## s High Commission on Human Right## s . 
expert## s must be involve## d . 
the## y should visit In## dia and consider the con## sequenc## es of Union Car## bi## de &apos;## s## activities and the Bhopal disaster in term## s of poll## ution of under## ground water## s and the environment . 
clear## ly , this also ha## s con## sequenc## es for human right## s in the affect## ed area## s and communit## ies . 
in add## ition , the tragi## c case of Bhopal high## light## s the need to require comp## an## ies to assume the same respons## ibil## ities as states in today &apos;## s global## ised world econom## y . 
comp## an## ies must be party to international agree## ments and convention## s . 
impact assess## ments need to be under## take## n , bo## th as regard## s respect for human right## s and situ## ations of arm## ed conflict and tension . 
this is the rational## e under## pinning the amend## ments propos## ed by the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance . 
I appeal to honour## able Member## s to stu## dy them care## fully be## fore de## cid## ing how to vot## e . 
I should also like to take this opportun## ity to public## ise the propos## al ma## de by the School of Peace Cult## ure of the Auto## nom## ous Univers## ity of Bar## celona . 
accord## ing## ly , I call on the House and the European Union to promot## e 3 Dec## ember as an international day of corporate respons## ibility and human right## s . 
the aim is for comp## an## ies to commit to the promot## ion and protection of human right## s the world over . 
this special d## ate should be an opportun## ity for states , international bodies and civil soci## ety , a## mong## st other## s , to reflect on the## ir share## d respons## ibility . 
all international actor## s share the du## ty of creat## ing a fair## er and more sustain## able world . 
Mr President , if you go to Bhopal today - not 20 year## s ago , but today - you will see thousand## s of ton## nes of toxic waste in pile## s , pool## s of mer## cur## y , skip## s of poison## ed waste and bag## s of chemical## s ly## ing in the open air , seep## ing , when## ever the rain## s come , in## to the pudd## les , stream## s and ground## water ; and you will see people suffer## ing be## cause the## y drink that water . 
the## y suffer from pain## s in the stomach , head## ache## s , anaemia and gynaeco## logical problem## s be## cause the## y have no alter## native but to drink from th## ose well## s . 
that is the problem we are fac## ing in Bhopal today , and we are fac## ing it 20 year## s after that catastrophe , when s## o man## y people died . 
the figure## s range from 3## .000 to 7 000 on one night ; 15 000 later on and 1## 00 000 people s## till suffer## ing from debilit## ating dis## ease## s . 
we are talk## ing about 15 year## s after the settle## ment which ga## ve US $ 500 million to the Indian Govern## ment to disburse for compens## ation and rect## ification of that landscape . 
it is s## till a picture of desol## ation and danger for th## ose people . 
we in this Parliament do not do well when we seek to be judge and ju## ry in these case## s . 
that is why I can## not accept the Green amend## ments that have be## en refer## red to . 
the motion it## self stand## s well be## cause it call## s on the European Union to work with the Govern## ment of In## dia to use the money that is avail## able to make s## ure that there is a clean @## -## @ up of th## ose s## ites , treat## ment of affect## ed people and compens## ation to th## ose affect## ed ; and now , not in an## other 20 year## s . 
that is our mess## age to all th## ose affect## ed : to the European Union ; to the Indian Govern## ment ; by all mean## s , to Dow Chem## ical## s and it## s respons## ibil## ities and to the court## s which will be look## ing at that . 
but today we seek justice for th## ose people and renov## ation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of it## s people . 
. Mr President , I am glad to be able to s## peak im## mediate## ly after Mr Bow## is , who ha## s impress## ed upon us where we have go## t to 20 year## s after 3 Dec## ember 19## 84 , when gas from a 35 @## -## @ ton## ne cock## tail of high## ly toxic sub## stance## s cause## d 7## .000 people to di## e when the## ir heart## s and lung## s fail## ed . 
to this day , some 25## .000 have gone down in histo## ry as the victim## s of the big## gest chemical accident ever record## ed , and some 500## .000 are s## till cripp## led as a con## sequenc## e of it . 
what , though , was done for the victim## s ? 
research ha## s show## n that , 15 year## s ago , compens## ation to the tune of US## D 4## 70 million was agree## d on by Union Car## bi## de and the Indian Govern## ment . 
s## o far , the 1## 00## .000 official## ly register## ed as victim## s have receiv## ed US## D 3## 00 e## ach . 
there are 2.5## 00 house## s for widow## s a## long with seven hospital## s , and man## y facilit## ies have be## en built , but what ha## s happen## ed to the rest of the money , some US## D 4## 00 million ? 
I have to tell Mr## s Gill that we re## ally do have to ask who is to blame for that . 
the ground is s## till contamin## ated . 
the ground water is heav## ily contamin## ated with mer## cur## y , and that is not going to go away . 
toxic residue## s are store## d in the open air . 
small wonder , th## en , that we end up with the situ## ation that Mr Bow## is ha## s describ## ed , with chronic ill## ness## es , brain damage , and child## ren born with de## form## ities . 
if there is to be any substanti## al improve## ment in medical provision for the victim## s , th## en the Indian Pr## ime Minister , Mr S## ing## h , will have to inter## vene , and the govern## ment should comp## ly with the Sup## reme Court &apos;## s ruling and final## ly re## lease the fund## s and en## able full compens## ation to be paid out . 
man## y chemical comp## an## ies s## till have production operation## s in In## dia and in other part## s of the world where labour and environment## al standard## s are far be## low th## ose that app## ly in the European Union or the US## A . 
as the Committee on Em## ploy## ment and Soci## al Affair## s &quot; rapporteur on the REACH programme , I can do no other th## an reiterate the demand ma## de in the work## ing paper : if there is to be compar## ability , we need rule## s ma## de by the European Union , and , in the same way , rule## s laid down as standard## s by the W## TO . 
th## ose who## s## e desir## e for increas## ed profit## s lead## s them to allow the mini## mum environment## al require## ments with## out except## ion are accept## ing the like## lihood of a second Bhopal one day , and that is some## thing that non## e of us can afford . 
. - Mr President , it ha## s be## en twen## ty year## s since the trage## dy in Bhopal in In## dia , with it## s huge human## itarian and eco## logical con## sequenc## es , and I believ## e that the initiative by the political group## s for the adopt## ion of a motion in plen## ary by the European Parliament is particular## ly import## ant . 
how## ever , it is not en## ough to jo## g the memor## y , it is not en## ough to condemn what is often the un## account## able operation of multi## national comp## an## ies in develop## ing countries , it is not en## ough just to state our human## itarian aware## ness in word## s . 
this sort of trage## dy may be experience## d again by people in some other part of the world if the international communit## y does not move to introduce international mechan## ism## s for control## ling the operation of multi## national comp## an## ies , for protect## ing the environment and for protect## ing human right## s and the right## s of workers . 
this is where the role of the European Union with## in the frame## work of the UN and with## in the frame## work of other international organisation## s may be more efficient . 
the motion record## s the problem## s which s## till exist and numer## ous honour## able member## s s## poke about them in the area of Bhopal as a whole . 
how## ever , in my opinion , it does not fully reflect the ef## fort## s ma## de by the federal and regional author## ities in In## dia over re## cent year## s in the field## s of medical , economic , social and environment## al restitution . 
import## ant poli## cies have be## en implement## ed which we should not over## look . 
to close , I consider that the best way for us to express our sympath## y with the victim## s and the## ir fami## lies is for the European Commission to take initiative## s in co## operation with the World Health Organ## isation on the implement## ation of medical and environment## al restitution programme## s . 
- Mr President , Mr## s Grybauskaitė , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should like to congratul## ate Mr## s Grybauskaitė on her assumption of office , and to wish her the best of luck . 
as Ernest He## ming## way o## nce s## aid , &apos; n## ever s## end to know for whom the bell toll## s ; it toll## s for the## e . &quot; 
it is to be welcome## d that the European Parliament is concern## ing it## self with region## s of the world that are far re## mov## ed from Europe , and that it is do## ing s## o with## out regard to the require## ments of political interest . 
on the one hand , the European Union ha## s declare## d a strategic partner## ship with In## dia , and y## et on the other hand , Parliament &apos;## s re## solution states that the Indian Govern## ment ha## s done li## ttle to protect people from the effect## s of the Bhopal disaster . 
we are discuss## ing the neglig## ence of the Indian author## ities , and right## ly s## o , y## et we should also make known our view## s on the li## ability of the US comp## any that impose## d savage nineteen## th @## -## @ cent## ury capital## ism and fail## ed to observ## e any of the safety require## ments that we## re man## d## atory in the US## A . 
the figure## s are as follow## s ; 7## .000 death## s in the im## mediate after## math of the disaster , and up to 30## .000 death## s over the 20 year## s which follow## ed , with over 1## 00## .000 having fall## en ill to d## ate . 
obvi## ously these statistic## s can## not express the human suffer## ing , and mer## e## ly conceal the pain and tear## s . 
Bhopal must act as a warn## ing for govern## ments to put in place rescu## e system## s , and for them not to abandon people . 
it must act as a warn## ing for international comp## an## ies to ensu## re that the desir## e to make a profit does not replace the desir## e to promot## e safety . 
it must act as a warn## ing for international structure## s and organisation## s to provid## e support to region## s hit by disaster## s . 
in conclusion , Mr President , it should also act as a warn## ing for us to call to account th## ose who have take## n s## uch assist## ance from us or from any## one else . 
. Mr President , the Commission welcome## s Parliament &apos;## s initiative to launch an ur## gent debate on this issue . 
it is an import## ant opportun## ity for us to reflect on the way in which we can offer help to the victim## s and how to prevent that set of disaster## s from occur## ring in futur## e . 
let me assure Parliament that the Commission ha## s be## en read## y to support In## dia in deal## ing with this trage## dy and will do s## o in the futur## e . 
through our de## centralise## d co## operation budget line , we have support## ed local non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s in Bhopal with re## habilit## ation and s## kill## s train## ing for victim## s of the disaster , as well as giving support to women &apos;## s self @## -## @ help group## s . 
through our Health and Fami## ly Wel## fare Pro## gramme , we have support## ed the Bhopal Di## strict Hospital , as well as patient wel## fare soci## e## ties of district hospital## s and communit## y centre## s in the region . 
special assist## ance was give## n to the Municipal Corp## oration of Bhopal for the prepar## ation of an urban re## productive and child health plan . 
in add## ition , the Commission ha## s provid## ed a grant of EUR 10 million for the fund## ing of the Govern## ment of In## dia &apos;## s Nation## al Dis## a## ster Risk Man## age## ment Pro## gramme . 
at the re## cent EU @## -## @ In## dia summit held in The Ha## gue , In## dia re## confirm## ed it## s interest in pursu## ing an environment dia## logue with the European Union and propos## ed the organisation of an EU @## -## @ In## dia environment for## um . 
this for## um will be a first step in tack## ling the enormous environment## al problem## s that threaten bo## th In## dia and the European Union . 
let me finish by express## ing our deep## est sympath## y for all the victim## s and our firm hope that s## uch a catastrophe will n## ever occur again . 
thank you , Commission## er . 
we s## hall now proceed to the vot## e on these draft re## solution## s . 
the debate is closed . 
Mr President , I simpl## y wish## ed to point out that there is a mistake in the vot## ing list circul## ated to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament . 
as regard## s the amend## ments on Bhopal , we vot## ed again## st the first of these and in favour of the other three . 
I should like to note that my card ha## s s## till not be## en register## ed and is re## fusing to work . 
I wish## ed to vot## e in favour . 
your comment ha## s be## en not## ed . 
Mr President , I would like to ra## ise an## other point of order . 
yesterday , we we## re vot## ing until 2 p.m . 
it ha## s in fact al## ways be## en the custom of this House to vot## e between n## oon and 1.3## 0 p.m. , be## cause we do of course have a lot of lunch## time commit## ments and we end up keeping our guest## s wait## ing . 
I would there## fore ask the Bur## eau to make it a rule - as it was in the pre## vi## ous legisl## ative period - that vot## ing end## s at 1.3## 0 p.m . 
I would also like to take the opportun## ity to wish all th## ose present in the Chamber a Mer## ry Christ## mas and a Happy New Year . 
thank you for your comment , Mr Rü## big . 
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourn## ed , and I wish you all a Mer## ry Christ## mas and a Happy New Year 20## 05 . 
the next item is the debate on the report ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 70 / 20## 04 ) by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , on be## half of the Committee on Constitution## al Affair## s , on the Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe 20## 04 / 21## 29 ( IN## I ) . 
. Mr President , the enlarge## ment of the European Union mean## s we are having to upgrad## e from driv## ing a mini## bus , cap## able of taking 15 pass## enger## s , to a full @## -## @ s## ized bus , cap## able of taking 25 , with some spare seat## s to take on new pass## enger## s in due course . 
this large## r bus need## s a strong## er motor if we are not to slow down , and one that en## able## s us to cross the difficult hill## s that lie on our path . 
if we are to have a strong## er motor , we will also occasion## ally need strong## er brake## s - per## hap## s an emerge## ncy brake - and better safety feature## s too , s## uch as a safety belt on e## ach seat . 
since we are upgrad## ing , we should also have more comfort## able seat## s s## o that every pass## enger feel## s at home and comfort## able in this bus . 
also , while we are at it , why not have a geo @## -## @ satellite position## ing system s## o we al## ways know exact## ly where we are on the road## map and can better plan the journey## s we want to take together by the most efficient and comfort## able rout## e ? 
that is why we need a new set of rule## s for the European Union : a new Constitution to replace the current constitutional order and the set of overlap## ping Treat## ies . 
in concrete term## s this mean## s a set of improve## ments that the Committee on Constitution## al Affair## s and your rapporteur## s have ident## ified as fall## ing in## to four main categor## ies . 
first , it mean## s great## er clar## ity as to what the Union is , how it work## s and function## s . 
under this head## ing one can ident## ify a s## ing## le Treat## y in## stead of the sever## al overlap## ping Treat## ies - a s## ing## le , clear## er document that spell## s out more clear## ly the object## ive## s and the value## s of the Union and it## s compete## nce## s , what it is respons## ible for and what it is not respons## ible for , and how it work## s , with few## er and clear## er procedure## s . 
this will make it easi## er for citizen## s to see and to understand what our Union is about . 
we will get rid of the distinct## ion between &apos; Union &apos; and &apos; Comm## un## ity &apos; , which no## body except lawyer## s understand## s , creat## ing a s## ing## le legal ent## ity . 
it make## s it clear that we are not creat## ing some huge monolith## ic mon## ster - the myth## ology of the super## state that some people seem to fear . 
it is clear that we are not creat## ing a centralise## d Union . 
second , it will provid## e for a more effective Union - a Union cap## able of de## cid## ing and acting with 25 Member State## s . 
it will make for more qualified major## ity vot## ing and more continu## ity in the chair## manship of the European Council . 
there will be a s## ing## le foreign minister to s## peak for the Union to the out## side world , in## stead of the Commission s## peak## ing on some issue## s and the High Representative of the Council on other## s , which mean## t that thir## d countries n## ever k## new whom the## y had to deal with . 
th## ose post## s will be merge## d in## to a s## ing## le position . 
thir## d , and most import## ant in my view , it will provid## e more demo## cracy and account## ability in the Union . 
under the Constitution , all legisl## ation will be subject first to the prior scrutin## y of national parliament## s , and th## en the double control of the Council and the European Parliament at European level , s## uch that bo## th have to approve vi## rtual## ly every item of European legisl## ation . 
frank## ly , this make## s the European Union the most democratic international structure , or supranational structure , that exist## s in the world . 
compar## e the EU to the IM## F , to the World Bank , to the W## TO or to any other international structure : non## e of them have or will have this degree of parliament## ary in## put and of parliament## ary scrutin## y . 
we should be proud of the demo## cracy that exist## s at the heart of this Union . 
the Constitution will significant## ly reinforce that demo## cracy by extend## ing co## decision , by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by im## prov## ing parliament## ary control over the Commission and the s## o @## -## @ call## ed com## it## ology system for delegate## d second## ary legisl## ation . 
four## th , the Constitution introduce## s great## er right## s for citizen## s through the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , which ha## s be## en in## corporate## d in## to the Constitution . 
this , of course , appli## es on## ly in the field of compete## nce of European Union law , but that is a significant field of compete## nce , and all European legisl## ation hence## forth will have to comp## ly with that Char## ter . 
all of this ha## s led us to conclude that the Constitution is , to quote the committee &apos;## s report , a &apos; vast improve## ment &apos; . 
it is a vast improve## ment on the current Treat## ies and on the current constitutional order . 
it merit## s our support . 
these improve## ments are due in no small part to the in## put of the European Parliament in## to the Convent## ion and the IGC . 
we can be proud of our result## s . 
it is a compromis## e . 
it is not a Utopia## n treat## y . 
all of us would have written it s## light## ly different## ly had we had to write it our## selves , but as a compromis## e package it is a distinct improve## ment . 
I am confident that tomor## row Parliament will endorse it by an overwhelm## ing major## ity . 
this Parliament , elect## ed by citizen## s a## cross the whole of Europe , with part## ies from left to right a## cross the political spec## trum , part## ies in govern## ment and part## ies in op## position , will s## end a power## ful signal if it endorse## s the Constitution tomor## row by an overwhelm## ing major## ity . 
I am confident it will . 
. 
Mr President , when at the last plen## ary session of the last term in office I had the honour of s## peak## ing on be## half of my group at an e## vent held by this House in hom## age to Mon## net , Schu## man and S## pin## elli , I wonder## ed what the found## ing father## s , the vision## aries of Europe , would have thought of the point in European integration we we## re at and what the## y would have thought of the European Constitution . 
I believ## e - I s## aid it th## en and I repeat it today - that the## y would not have believ## ed that what was happen## ing was real , be## cause , leav## ing be## hind a Europe divid## ed by fratricidal confront## ations , this Constitution sanction## s peace on our continent and , to use Mr Ger## em## ek &apos;## s beautiful express## ion , this Constitution stitch## es the two Europe## s together . 
we are mov## ing on from a Europe desol## ated by total## itarian regime## s to a Europe - and this is sanction## ed by the Constitution - bas## ed on democratic system## s in which fundamental right## s are respect## ed . 
after a Europe of ration book## s , this Constitution sanction## s a Europe of prosper## ity and material well @## -## @ be## ing . 
over## coming a Europe which had dis## appear## ed from the world , this Constitution sanction## s a Europe of solid## arity , as demonst## rated by the enormous wave of solid## arity which ha## s arise## n on our continent to deal with the effect## s of the other terr## ible wave that s## truck Asia . 
this Constitution will have , and does have , instrument## s which will allow Europe to play a great## er role in the world from now on . 
I believ## e that the Constitution mark## s a point of no return and , just as , not s## o long ago , the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmon## y , which allow## ed us to move in## to the futur## e , this European Constitution is going to allow all of us European## s to move forward together with## in a project of common civil## isation . 
the value of the European Constitution is that it re## move## s the ambigu## ities ; it is the first document to define what the European Union is , as a Union of State## s and citizen## s , and does not weaken the Member State## s , far from it , be## cause the Union &apos;## s compete## nce## s are compete## nce## s that come from the Member State## s , and it does not weaken national Constitution## s , quit## e the contr## ary : it strength## ens them , be## cause the strength of the European Constitution s## tem## s from the strength of the national Constitution## s . 
with this Constitution , Europe is demonst## rating that it is much more th## an a market ; it is a market as well , and that is import## ant , but it is much more : it is a project of common civil## isation bas## ed on our religious , cultural and human## ist heritage . 
this is acknowledg## ed in the first sentenc## e of the preamble , bas## ed on the value## s of free## dom and human dign## ity , found## ed upon the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
it is also a Constitution that opt## s for a particular economic system : a capital## ist system with a social dimension . 
if we look at the histo## ry of Europe , we see that that was not s## o obvi## ous fif## ty year## s ago . 
today it is . 
for all of these reason## s , I believ## e , Mr President , that man## y of the flag## s that this Parliament ha## s un## fur## led over re## cent year## s are today standing as proud as th## ose we have be## hind us . 
I join## ed this Parliament 13 year## s ago , when it was a consult## ative assemb## ly ; today it no long## er is . 
I join## ed this Parliament when there was talk of the European Union &apos;## s democratic de## ficit ; I believ## e that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic de## ficit , be## cause this Constitution introduce## s more demo## cracy , more efficiency , more clar## ity and more trans## par## ency , as my friend , Rich## ard Corbett , ha## s quit## e right## ly point## ed out . 
Mr President , this work ha## s be## en done by man## y people over man## y year## s . 
I would like to acknowledg## e them today . 
I would like to remind you of the name## s of Emil## io Col## om## bo , Marcel## ino O## re## ja , Fernan## d Her## man , Giorgio Nap## olitano , Olivier Du## ham## el , Antonio Seg## uro , Dimitri## s Tsatsos , Antoine## tte Spa## ak , and s## o man## y people who , seat## ed here in this Parliament , have defend## ed what today is going to become a re## ality . 
the## y have often be## en call## ed utopia## ns or dream## ers ; well , today , these dream## s , these utopia## s , are be## coming re## ality . 
we in this Parliament can feel ver## y proud of the work we have done . 
Mr President , eight year## s ago in this ver## y Chamber , a young Member of Parliament defend## ed the opinion on the Treat## y of Amsterdam and s## aid that it was not perfect , as we k## new , but that it was not the final desti## nation , and cite## d , as I am going to do again today , a Miguel de Cer## van## te## s dis## enchant## ed with life in hi## s final days , who s## aid that there we## re occasion## s when we had to cho## ose whet## her to be a road or an in## n . 
that was a road , and that road ha## s led us to where we are today and I believ## e that today , in this comfort## able in## n represent## ed by the European Constitution , over the coming year## s we European## s are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace , free## dom , justice and solid## arity . 
I would , there## fore , be de## light## ed if tomor## row this Parliament vot## es in favour of this document , and this is ver## y import## ant , since it usher## s in a new er## a on our continent . 
Mr Sch## mit ha## s the floor on be## half of the Council , and I would like to thank him in particular for be## ing here , and also express our condolence## s to him and the people of Luxembourg , who are in national mourn## ing follow## ing the death of the Grand Du## ches## s . 
Mr President , I should like to thank you for these express## ions of solid## arity with the people of Luxembourg at a time of great sorrow . 
I am ver## y grat## e## ful in## de## ed . 
personal## ly , this is the first time that I have had the honour of appear## ing be## fore Parliament and it is there## fore a great honour and a great pleas## ure to be able to s## peak in this House , on the Council &apos;## s be## half , on a matter as import## ant as the draft European Constitution . 
I had the opportun## ity to work with some of you in the Convent## ion and I feel that I can say that the work done in the Convent## ion was histo## ric , remark## able work that under## line## s the import## ance of the process that we are current## ly pursu## ing . 
in this con## text , I should like to congratul## ate the rapporteur## s on the## ir excel## lent work . 
the mess## age that you all wish to s## end out tomor## row by mean## s of an overwhelm## ing vot## e in Parliament is also intend## ed for the citizen## s , be## cause this Constitution is prim## arily a constitut## ion for the citizen## s ; it is the## y who will deriv## e the great## est benefit from it . 
it ha## s be## en s## aid that this Constitution democrat## ises our Union . 
it strength## ens citizen## s &quot; right## s , through the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s ; it confer## s new right## s on Europe &apos;## s citizen## s , by giving them the opportun## ity to interact with the institution## s and in particular the Commission . 
this Treat## y confirm## s that we are no long## er an economic Union and that we are more th## an a political Union in the making ; we are , first and fore## most , a Union bas## ed on common value## s . 
in this respect , the Constitution is a cruc## ial step in the integration process . 
o## nce Parliament ha## s had it## s say , it will be the citizen## s &quot; turn to s## peak , either direct## ly , through refer## endum## s , in countries where refer## endum## s are to be held , or in## direct## ly , through parliament## ary rat## ification . 
the Council is commit## ted to channel## ling all the necess## ary energ## ies for this Constitution to be adopt## ed in all Member State## s . 
e## ach Member State , e## ach govern## ment and e## ach parliament now ha## s the respons## ibility to take us over this hurdle s## o that the Constitution can enter in## to force , and , I should add , on the schedul## ed d## ate . 
the European Parliament , national govern## ments and national parliament## s share a great respons## ibility in this respect . 
we must work together if we are to meet this challenge . 
. Mr President , the Constitution be## fore us today would not have be## en possible with## out the European Parliament . 
this House ha## s play## ed a cruc## ial role in strength## ening the found## ations of our common enter## prise , not least through the substanti## al contribut## ions ma## de by Member## s of this Parliament d## uring the European Convent## ion . 
it would also not have be## en possible with## out that European Convent## ion , which provid## ed s## uch a dynamic , open and innov## ative mean## s of negoti## ation . 
the involve## ment of the European Parliament in this unprecedented process culminate## s today with an excel## lent and well @## -## @ written report , which s## end## s a clear mess## age on the benefit## s of the Constitution and the need for it## s rat## ification . 
I whole## hearted## ly congratul## ate Parliament , and in particular the Committee on Constitution## al Affair## s and the two rapporteur## s , Rich## ard Corbett and Íñigo Mén## dez de Vi## go . 
the Commission fully support## s your re## solution . 
we firm## ly believ## e that the Constitution allow## s the Union to make significant improve## ments . 
in simpl## e term## s , for the first time the power## s , compete## nce## s , right## s and du## ties of the Union are set out in a s## ing## le Constitution . 
the Constitution consolidate## s and simpl## ifies half a cent## ury of treat## y change## s , allow## ing us to move from 12 basic treat## y act## s to a s## ing## le text . 
it make## s the Union more open and simpl## er to understand . 
the Constitution modernise## s the institutional structure . 
it increas## es the power## s of the European Parliament and provid## es for citizen## s active## ly to particip## ate in the decision @## -## @ making process through a petition with one million sign## ature## s . 
we will have more demo## cracy . 
the Constitution set## s out , in 54 concise article## s , the fundamental right## s we will guarantee to our citizen## s . 
for the first time the Union will accede to the European Convent## ion on Human Right## s , s## o there will be more right## s for our citizen## s . 
these three simpl## e con## cept## s - more right## s , more demo## cracy and more open## ness - explain why this Constitution should be ratifi## ed . 
we would certain## ly have wish## ed to be more ambitious in certain policy area## s , but the final result is the best possible compromis## e in the current political situ## ation . 
I also accept that people have fear## s and critic## ism## s regard## ing this Constitution . 
it is not a perfect text and we should not hide from respond## ing to these concern## s . 
our la## test Euro## barometer survey show## s that 68 % of our citizen## s support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution . 
other opinion poll## s show that man## y feel the## y are in## adequate## ly inform## ed about the content of the Constitution . 
your report ha## s ma## de a good start by reject## ing some of the mis## conception## s and s## care st## ories about the Constitution . 
it provid## es a range of good reason## s for the Euro @## -## @ special## ists to be vot## ing y## es , but these are not al## ways the reason## s that will persuade a s## ing## le mother in Gdansk , or a ship## yard work## er in Spa## in to do s## o . 
the rat## ification of the Constitution is an opportun## ity to debate the kind of Europe we want . 
I welcome this opportun## ity to remind our## selves of what Europe ha## s achiev## ed and what Europe stand## s for , as ha## s s## o elegant## ly be## en explain## ed by other## s . 
in the mid @## -## @ 19## 80## s , the vision of creat## ing a genuine s## ing## le market seem## ed a bridge too far . 
and y## et it happen## ed , bring## ing in it## s wake an economic dynam## ism from which we s## till benefit . 
to cite one simpl## e ex## ample , the fact that we do not have to go through custom## s at border## s ha## s dramat## ical## ly reduce## d cost## s and deliver## y time## s . 
in a s## ing## le step we re## mov## ed the need for 60 million V## AT document## s per year . 
today , the young## er generation treat as a right the idea of a zone of free move## ment , in the same way that the## y expect the Union to ensu## re a clean environment and cross @## -## @ border co## operation on public health . 
today , in 12 countries of the EU , we have a piece of Europe in our pocket## s , with the euro be## ing take## n for grant## ed a## cross the Union and with new Member State## s join## ing the queue to introduce it . 
final## ly , first through member## ship of Greece , Spa## in and Port## ugal and now with the 10 new Member State## s , we have help## ed guarantee and consolidate demo## cracy and the rule of law a## cross the whole continent . 
we must now turn to the rat## ification of the Constitution . 
while we respect our different constitutional role## s in relation to the national rat## ification process## es , we can## not toler## ate the debate be## ing con## fuse## d by myth## s or mis## conception## s about the content of the Constitution . 
all of us have a du## ty to make avail## able clear and reli## able inform## ation on what the Constitution does and the benefit## s it can bring . 
in s## o do## ing we must compar## e the result## s of the Constitution with the current situ## ation . 
Lithuania and Hung## ary have al## read## y ratifi## ed the Constitution . 
I would , in particular , like to pay trib## ute to Lithuania and the speaker of the Lithuania## n Parliament , who is here in the Chamber today . 
we must now start to show what concrete impact the Constitution can have on the dai## ly live## s of the people we represent . 
in## de## ed , there is no short## age of good ex## ample## s in this respect . 
as I s## aid ear## lier , the inclus## ion of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s is far from a symbol## ic innov## ation . 
citizen## s will have a cata## logue of right## s and principle## s who## s## e respect by the public author## ities - be the## y European or national - the## y will be entitle## d to invoke be## fore the court## s . 
the possibil## ity of concrete particip## ation in the function## ing of the Union is extend## ed far beyond the elect## ion of the Member## s of the European Parliament . 
the citizen## s &apos; initiative will , for the first time , make European citizen## s protagonist## s in the legisl## ative process . 
modern## isation of the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice will allow the Union to respond to the grow## ing demand for more effective European action in the field## s of border control## s , asy## lum and im## migration . 
the same is tru## e for judicial and police co## operation . 
the Constitution lay## s the found## ations for a s## ing## le area of lib## er## ties and guarantee## s . 
the new provision## s on public health will provid## e high## er qual## ity standard## s with regard to safety . 
the Union will be able to inter## vene in a more effective way to prevent and fight cross @## -## @ border health threat## s s## uch as a## vian flu or B## SE . 
today , we can## not avoid think## ing about the tragi## c even## ts in South## east Asia . 
the Union is al## read## y play## ing a key role in provid## ing human## itarian aid and contribut## ing to the political , economic and social re## construct## ion of that region . 
the new provision## s on civil protection , which entrust the Union with the task of promot## ing consist## ency in international civil protection work , will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the futur## e . 
we have , of course , al## read## y put in place a number of initiative## s aim## ed at inform## ing the public about the content of the Constitution . 
the Commission ha## s produce## d written and audio @## -## @ visual material , develop## ed a web## site , promot## ed and financ## ed inform## ation relay## s , and sponsor## ed seminar## s and other public initiative## s . 
the European Council ha## s support## ed our ef## fort## s , call## ing on the Member State## s to improve the## ir capacity for communic## ation about European issue## s in the con## text of the rat## ification of the Constitution . 
it is now time to move up a gear . 
I seize this occasion to call on you to examin## e the possibil## ity of put## ting in place joint communic## ation initiative## s with us that can maxim## ise the impact of our initiative## s . 
I refer , in particular , to the possibil## ity of organ## ising media even## ts at bo## th European and national level d## uring a &apos; European week &apos; , a## round 9 May 20## 05 . 
in the mean## time the Commission will not refrain from develop## ing other idea## s that can assist the Member State## s in draw## ing up and implement## ing the## ir national communic## ation strate## gies . 
I can also assure you that the Commission## ers them## selves will be active in the debate on the Constitution and the futur## e of Europe . 
sec## uring the rat## ification of the Constitution## al Treat## y is the main concern for the Member State## s and for the European institution## s . 
how## ever , while we do not intend to anticip## ate application of the Constitution , we must also devote some ef## fort to ens## uring a smooth ent## ry in## to force of the Constitution o## nce the rat## ification procedure## s have be## en success## fully final## ised . 
that is why we need to open discuss## ions on prepar## ing for implement## ation of the current provision## s . 
the Commission ha## s be## en engage## d in this process from the start . 
we are proud of the text of the Constitution and will do our ut## most to ensu## re that it s## ees the light of day . 
I remain commit## ted to dia## logue with the European Parliament . 
our work will not stop today . 
in fact it is on## ly just start## ing . 
I look forward to deba## ting these issue## s in more detail with the Constitution## al Affair## s Committee and join## ing you on different plat## form## s to present our case . 
in conclusion , I return to my three simpl## e con## cept## s : more right## s , more demo## cracy and more open## ness . 
this year we will celeb## rate the 15## th annivers## ary of the re## birth of demo## cracy in East## ern Europe . 
setting a## side all other provision## s of the Constitution , these three con## cept## s al## one under## line why countries have join## ed the European Union and why the Commission will defend this Constitution . 
. Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , we have come a long way , and th## ose of us who we## re Member## s of the pre## vi## ous Parliament will be able to re## member how , in this Chamber , we debate## d the Treat## y of N## ice . 
at the time , man## y of us we## re un## satisfied with it , and we s## aid that our stance on the Treat## y of N## ice would ultimate## ly depend on what new method of reform we might have in the futur## e and on what the ef## fort## s at reform add## ed up to . 
the result of that is in front of us today : the Treat## y on a Constitution for the European Union . 
un## like in Dec## ember 20## 00 , when we discuss## ed N## ice in the absence of the C## ent## ral European countries - Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , Po## land , Czechoslovak## ia ( which is now the Czech Republic ) , Slovak## ia , Hung## ary , and Slovenia , not to mention Mal## ta and Cyprus , non## e of whom had y## et join## ed us , it is a particular## ly happy circum## stance that today , the day when we are deba## ting the Constitution , we have a## mong us Member## s from these countries , particular## ly from th## ose European countries that we## re o## nce Communist . 
I think that is a wonder## ful symbol of the futur## e we share on the continent of Europe . 
I would like to extend ver## y warm thank## s to Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go for the out## standing work the## y have done together with the Committee on Constitution## al Affair## s , and also to all th## ose who assist## ed them in it . 
today , I would also like to thank the Chair## man of the Convent## ion , Val## é## ry Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing , for the work he di## d , which was some## time## s on the receiv## ing end of critic## ism , but if he had not done as he di## d , we would prob## ably not have this Constitution today , and s## o Mr Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing deserve## s our warm## est grat## itude today . 
we are the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) - and of the European Democrat## s . 
there are 1## 28 MEP## s in the European People &apos;## s Part## y , and the DE part of our group ha## s 40 Member## s . 
s## peak## ing for the P## PE part of our group , I can assure you that we will be say## ing &apos; y## es &quot; to this Constitution with## out reserv## ations , while the European Democrat## s in our group are entitle## d to come up with the## ir own position## s . 
a constitut## ion need## s value## s . 
al## most as cruc## ial as the procedure## s are the value## s that bind us together , for if we have no aware## ness of value## s , we have no found## ation on the bas## is of which we can take political action . 
we rejoic## e that man## y of our value## s , which we see as Christ## ian , have be## en include## d : human dign## ity , the dign## ity of old## er people , the worth of child## ren too . 
I think it particular## ly splendid that child## ren get a mention in the Constitution , for with## out child## ren , this continent ha## s no futur## e , that we have describ## ed our value## s and ban## ned clon## ing , and that reference is ma## de to our principle## s - the rule of law , demo## cracy , subsid## i## arity and solid## arity . 
all these thing## s give us cause to say &apos; y## es . &quot; 
today , though , I would not wish to den## y that man## y of us would have welcome## d a reference to God in the Constitution , be## cause it affirm## s that our human capacities are not in## finite . 
we would also have be## en glad to see reference ma## de to our Ju## d## aeo @## -## @ Christ## ian heritage , for , at a time when dia## logue with the world &apos;## s culture## s is s## o necess## ary - particular## ly with the Islamic world - I believ## e that it is import## ant that we know where our own root## s are , and that our cultural and religious development should be mention## ed in the Constitution . 
even though that is not in the Constitution , every Constitution is of course a compromis## e , and s## o we say &apos; y## es &quot; to this Constitution , be## cause it reflect## s our value## s . 
it is also proper that a constitut## ion should include a de## script## ion of the constitutional structure of the European Union , and I think it is particular## ly success## ful in this , talk## ing as it does in term## s of national ident## ity . 
Europe is not a melt## ing pot , nor is it mean## t to become a super## state ; on the contr## ary , it is in it## s divers## ity that Europe &apos;## s wealth is to be found , begin## ning in our town## s and communit## ies , where people live , and in the region## s . 
our nation states have the## ir own ident## ities . 
we have a Constitution## al Treat## y which declare## s that it is from the nation states that the Constitution origin## ate## s . 
it is through our own national citizen## ship that we are citizen## s of Europe , and hence free## dom of organisation for local author## ities is ma## de explic## it in the subsid## iary structure of Europe . 
I think that is quit## e a master## stroke . 
J## ean Mon## net , the first Ho## nor## ary Citizen of Europe , o## nce s## aid that nothing is possible with## out people , and that nothing last## s with## out institution## s , and what he s## aid is tru## e to this day . 
if we do not have value## s which under## pin every## thing , and if these value## s are not ultimate## ly express## ed in institution## s that em## body them , th## en th## ose value## s can## not be realis## ed . 
that is why it is right that we should follow J## ean Mon## net &apos;## s direct## ions and go down the road that lead## s to Europe as a communit## y , and , my dear friend## s - I apolog## ise for us## ing an express## ion current in my own party , but , as we are talk## ing about the Constitution today , we are some## how join## ed together as one , not that our differ## ence## s should be obscure## d - n## either now nor in the futur## e must it be inter## governmental## ism or co## operation between govern## ments that shape## s the European Union . 
the Europe of the futur## e must ra## ther be found## ed upon the Comm## un## ity method , and upon the Comm## un## ity action of the European institution## s . 
what this mean## s for us is that we need a strong European Parliament , one that is a symbol of demo## cracy , that we should act as equal## s in all matter## s affect## ing European legisl## ation , that we need a strong Commission , deriv## ing it## s legitim## acy from it## s elect## ion by the European Parliament and hence also from European elect## ions , and that we have to have a Council of Minister## s who## s## e action## s are trans## parent . 
let me conclude by say## ing that much that is in the Constitution is in the nature of a programme and ha## s y## et to become re## ality . 
an ex## ample of this is Article 7## 50 , which states how we are to live as good neighbour## s a## long## side the people## s of Europe who have a European vocation - and right now it is Ukraine of which I am think## ing . 
an## other is foreign policy , an area in which we can## not , in futur## e , allow our## selves to s## peak with two or three voice## s , but must act joint## ly . 
that is why it is not Member State## s of the European Union , as s## uch , that should be seek## ing to join the UN Security Council , but ra## ther the European Union as a whole , if it want## s to be a global actor for human right## s and demo## cracy . 
it is the European Union as s## uch that must be represent## ed in the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
we have man## y task## s a## head of us . 
I s## peak for my group when I say that I hope there will be broad support for this Constitution , not on## ly here in this House , but also in all the Member State## s , be## cause this Constitution is the mean## s where## by we will get through the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury as a Europe of free## dom , demo## cracy and peace . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , this coming 27 Janu## ary will mark the six## tieth annivers## ary of the libera## tion of the concentr## ation camp at Au## s## ch## witz . 
the found## ation of the European Co## al and St## eel Comm## un## ity a few year## s later was a direct con## sequenc## e of what had happen## ed d## uring the Second World War . 
the father## s and mother## s of European co## operation could see with the## ir own eye## s that ultra @## -## @ national## ism , F## asc## ism , and the division of our continent by Bol## sh## ev## ism , al## ways result## ed in oppress## ion , in terror , and in the dign## ity of the individual be## ing lo## st . 
the## y could also see that what creat## ed peace , dign## ity and demo## cracy was supranational action and integration at a supranational , European level . 
it is worth add## ing that this was th## en achiev## ed through the Co## al and St## eel Comm## un## ity gain## ing control of the weapon## s @## -## @ manu## fact## uring indus## tries . 
what we saw happen## ing in the 19## 90## s , when the states that have now accede## d took the## ir present form , was , in principle , a triumph over Communist oppress## ion in one part of Europe . 
the European Union is a union that ha## s manage## d to take the value## s describ## ed in our Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s and use them as the bas## is of democratic integration and to over## come bo## th the F## asc## ism and the Comm## un## ism of Europe &apos;## s past . 
the even## ts of re## cent days , in which people have be## en power## less in the face of force## s that no amount of technology ha## s en## able## d them to confront , show how absolut## e## ly necess## ary it is for action to be take## n at the supranational level , with no national border## s standing in the way . 
in the global village , the European Union is Europe &apos;## s rational and modern respons## e to the challenge## s of the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury . 
the Constitution we are now deba## ting is the frame## work provid## ed for it . 
our group will be vot## ing in favour of the Corbett / Mén## dez de Vi## go report - out of pro## found convict## ion , and also out of the convict## ion that the value## s describ## ed in this constitut## ion are civil value## s . 
the splendid thing about them is that you can understand them as Christ## ian value## s if you are a Christ## ian . 
you can understand them as your own value## s if you are a Jew or a Mos## lem or an un## believ## er . 
these value## s are universal and indi## visible , and s## o the## y are valid for every## one . 
that also make## s it e## asy for us , de## spite the division## s that other## wise separat## e us , to join together in support## ing this Constitution , but if we do that , it is our share## d bas## is for a democratic and dign## ified futur## e in a social communit## y with social respons## ibility and economic prosper## ity . 
in the knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed soci## ety of the futur## e , this Union of our## s must , at one and the same time - and the Constitution does in## de## ed set this out in black and white - perform it## s social task## s and guarantee the protection of the individual and of every citizen from the danger## s present in this divid## ed world . 
that is what this Constitution will be able to achiev## e , and we are large## ly agree## d that we are will## ing and oblig## ed to stand up for it and contend for it . 
one thing al## one is lack## ing , and , s## peak## ing for our group , I will spell out what it is . 
for the European Parliament to commit it## self and mobilise it## self is not en## ough . 
th## ose who sign## ed the## ir name## s to this Constitution at the dign## ified ceremony in Rome , which all of us chair## men of group## s we## re allow## ed to attend , Europe &apos;## s Head## s of State or Govern## ment and foreign minister## s , must , in the same way as we do , appear be## fore the people## s and declare that this is our Constitution and that we want it . 
far from this be## ing one individual matter to be left to the European Parliament or to the Commission , the states## men and states## women of Europe must do the## ir part and affirm this to be the## ir work - not on## ly the work of the European Parliament or of the Convent## ion on the## ir own . 
it is th## ose thing## s too , but it is the work of all th## ose who carry respons## ibility for Europe &apos;## s futur## e , and the## y must affirm , be## fore the people## s of Europe , the## ir support for it . 
if the## y do that , this Constitution will enjoy major## ity support , with the support of the P## PE Group and prob## ably even of that Group &apos;## s European Democrat## s . 
. Mr President , Mr Po## ette## ring proper## ly remind## s us that when Parliament react## ed to pre## vi## ous reform## s of the Treat## ies , the re## solution## s adopt## ed we## re pepper## ed with regret## s , critic## ism## s and thing## s that we deplor## e , p## lus demand## s for further reform . 
this time , we are not oblig## ed to do this be## cause we our## selves have be## en prominent## ly involve## d in the draft## ing of the reform## s , bo## th in the Convent## ion and the IGC . 
this report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go get## s the story right and I am pleas## ed to say that all Member## s of my Group who will be s## peak## ing today will be s## peak## ing in favour of this re## solution . 
there## after we will be out campaign## ing for the ent## ry in## to force in## side the Member State## s where refer## enda are to be held , including in France - to oppose certain fact## ions of the left - and in Brit## ain , where we will be fight## ing to oppose the right . 
the principal argument for this great reform is clear## ly that it strength## ens the European Union . 
it strength## ens our capacity to act a## broad and in## side our Member State## s , making us prepar## ed to stand on our own fee## t in world affair## s , s## hap## ing Europe &apos;## s respons## e to global## isation political## ly . 
the Constitution re## define## s the European Union . 
it strike## s a balance between states - the old and the new , the large and the small - between citizen## s and the author## ities and , as Mr Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing ha## s s## aid , between dream and re## ality . 
it ha## s creat## ed a fresh , large con## sensus be## hind the project of European integration . 
a word to th## ose s## uch as the Brit## ish Con## serv## ative## s who carp on the side## line## s : if you are for Europe , you should be for the Constitution . 
Europe can## not be construct## ed with## out clear , liberal and social value## s , strong rule## s and robust parliament## ary demo## cracy . 
Europe will not work with## out strong author## ities in Bru## ssels . 
with## out the Constitution , thing## s will not work proper## ly and the qual## ity of policy flow## ing from Bru## ssels and Strasbourg will begin to decline . 
futur## e expansion will be out of the question and I can## not believ## e that is what the Brit## ish Con## serv## ative Part## y re## ally believ## es in . 
but Europe can## not work either with## out strong leader## ship . 
this Parliament must learn to fill some of the strategic space that the reform## s begin to open up for us . 
we have man## y new power## s , including , import## ant## ly , the right to propos## e a reform - a reform in the futur## e of the Constitution it## self . 
the Commission must assert it## self quick## ly as the new arrange## ments for the Fo## reign Minister and the Fo## reign Service , the team preside## ncy and e## special## ly the s## o @## -## @ call## ed full @## -## @ time President of the European Council are put in place . 
the prim## e minister## s and preside## nts must co## ordinate the## ir campaign## s . 
I am pleas## ed to hear what Mr Sch## mit s## aid on that . 
the## y must should## er the## ir individual and collect## ive respons## ibility to win these refer## endum campaign## s by show## ing the vot## ers why these reform## s are for them and why this is tru## ly the Constitution for Europe . 
. - Mr President , a major## ity in the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance is in favour of rat## ification of the Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe , be## cause it s## ees it as an import## ant step on the road lead## ing to the political integration of our continent . 
de## spite the Treat## y &apos;## s man## y short## coming## s , there are no other alter## native## s in the current political and institutional con## text . 
the propos## ed Constitution establish## es the Union as a communit## y bas## ed on fundamental right## s , ground## s European poli## cies in a code of common value## s , define## s clear and bind## ing object## ive## s , and express## es a commit## ment to uphold sustain## ability in the economic , social and environment## al field## s . 
it include## s social right## s a## mong tradition## al human right## s , ties the Union &apos;## s external action## s to compliance with international law , simpl## ifies procedure## s , clar## ifies compete## nce## s , expand## s the s## cope of Comm## un## ity decision## s , and increas## es trans## par## ency and the democratic legitim## acy of the Union , as well as opportun## ities for it## s citizen## s to play a part . 
the text ha## s a good man## y gap## s and pit## fall## s in it , and it is understand## able that there should be grow## ing dis## affect## ion to## ward## s the European project a## mong man## y people , associ## ations and move## ments political## ly close to us , in who## s## e eye## s the Union is not y## et able to respond to the## ir concern## s or to be a political ent## ity fully able to act for a better , less un## fair world . 
to den## y this re## ality , as our fellow Member## s do in the## ir report , is , in our view , in## appropriate . 
for us Green## s , the European integration process can## not be consider## ed complete with the adopt## ion of the Constitution , part## ly be## cause other countries and people## s , beyond the current 25 , are s## till finish## ing or start## ing out on the## ir journey to join the Union . 
in that respect too , un## like the rapporteur## s , we believ## e that the Union &apos;## s institutional system is s## till too con## fuse## d and complic## ated and will not last much long## er with## out further reform . 
we there## fore believ## e that any development and improve## ment of the futur## e European Union will depend on rat## ification of this text . 
it is a danger## ous illusion to believ## e that reject## ing this text would prepar## e the way for an## other , better or even ideal constitut## ion . 
on the contr## ary , throw## ing it out would leave us with the provision## s of the Treat## y of N## ice , which are much less advance## d in term## s of bo## th the value## s of the## ir object## ive## s and the institutional structure the## y propos## e . 
if the Treat## y we## re defeat## ed , it would be an ideal opportun## ity for the Euro## sceptic## s to point out that the people no long## er want Europe , where## as we know ver## y well that this is not the case . 
it would also convince man## y govern## ments that the Convent## ion method - that timid , half @## -## @ hearted attempt to over## throw un## democratic , in## efficient method## s of reform like diploma## tic talk## s and the power of veto - can lead no## where . 
we there## fore have a double object## ive : to approve this Constitution s## o that we can quick## ly lay the found## ations for it## s success## or , by seek## ing to build a strong , s## table alli## ance with th## ose political , social , associ## ative and economic force## s that believ## e , as we do , that in order to achiev## e our aim## s of social justice , eco## logical## ly sustain## able development and peace , we must not on## ly win the elect## ions again at a national level , but also make European demo## cracy strong## er and more complete . 
to do that , we need to take back the initiative , and it is on that point , Mr President , that I believ## e it will be possible to re## build a unit## ed front of all th## ose who are today convince## d of the in## es## cap## able need for European demo## cracy but are divid## ed in the## ir evalu## ation of this text . 
. - Mr President , the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go concentr## ate## s al## most exclus## ive## ly on a s## eries of new provision## s that are not in the current Treat## ies . 
s## uch provision## s include re## plac## ing the rot## ating preside## ncy with a more s## table two @## -## @ and @## -## @ a @## -## @ half @## -## @ year preside## ncy , creat## ing the post of minister for foreign affair## s , albeit with## out communitar## ising the common foreign and securit## y policy , strength## ening Parliament &apos;## s power## s , accord## ing national parliament## s the right to call the Commission to account , where the## y feel it ha## s over## step## ped it## s power## s , and giving a million citizen## s the opportun## ity to propos## e that the Commission table a draft law on a particular matter . 
if the text submit## ted for rat## ification by the citizen## s or by the parliament## s we## re in fact limit## ed to that type of provision , man## y member## s of my group - not all , but man## y of them , including me - would not be oppose## d to the draft Constitution## al Treat## y . 
we are in favour of Europe and in favour of any## thing that serve## s to enhance Europe &apos;## s demo## cracy and improve it## s function## ing . 
we should not be bracket## ed with the UK In## depend## ence Part## y . 
we feel that there is a great need for Europe in this global## ised world , but what guide## line## s and structure## s do we need for Europe ? 
that is the question . 
the first thing we need , in our view , is a set of guide## line## s and structure## s that en## able us , at Union level , to control the financial market## s , ra## ther th## an be entire## ly at the## ir mer## cy , as we are now . 
this can be done , provid## ed that it is agree## d to make use of power## ful lever## s s## uch as the C## ent## ral Bank and tax## ation of the capital of major public bodies ; to make law## s aim## ed at holding comp## an## ies account## able on social , environment## al , democratic and ethical issue## s ; to channel fund## s thu## s re## lease## d in## to major political priorit## ies that are public## ly debate## d , democratic## ally establish## ed and regular## ly assess## ed . 
Europe is there## fore the appropriate level to meet challenge## s that a s## ing## le country would now## a## days have difficult## y in tack## ling , due to global## isation . 
it follow## s , for that ver## y reason , that we need guide## line## s and structure## s where## by we can re## verse the trend of maintain## ing the main decision @## -## @ making centre## s at a distance from the people , and where## by we can re## claim popular sovereign## ty and the power to make political cho## ice## s , in## stead of submit## ting to the law## s of the market , even if that mean## s encourag## ing fatal## ism , that dead## ly ene## my of demo## cracy . 
in other word## s , to achiev## e th## ose object## ive## s , Europe is also a relev## ant level , a level at which it is appropriate to promot## e the right## s of workers , citizen## s , member## s of Parliament and the public author## ities to access inform## ation and to take action , in order to reduce the arrog## ant power of th## ose who tend to see them## selves as modern day feud## al lord## s . 
in## de## ed , if there is a role that we are amp## ly entitle## d to expect Europe to take on in full , it is that of respons## ible play## er on the world s## tage , determine## d to use it## s influence to bring about the introdu## ction of a fresh set of rule## s govern## ing international relation## s . 
let us consider the potent## ial## ly salut## ary influence of , say , a European decision explic## it## ly to ban all re## course to war as a mean## s of solv## ing the world &apos;## s problem## s , s## o as to ensu## re that , from the Middle East to the Cau## cas## us , the force of politic## s prevail## s over the politic## s of force . 
think of the posit## ive influence of a decision to conclude alli## ance## s between Europe and the countries of the south that will extend to include international financial and trade institution## s , there## by tack## ling head @## -## @ on the murder## ous onslaught of economic war ; or of a decision to establish with the Unit## ed State## s , of course , the will to forge - with that great nation and with other## s - the most ambitious partner## ship possible , y## et with## in a frame## work of total political and strategic in## depend## ence . 
if you harbour s## uch ambit## ions for Europe , th## en per## hap## s some of you could tell us why , in that case , you are oppose## d to this draft Constitution . 
you are oppose## d to it precise## ly be## cause this text take## s up provision## s accumul## ated in particular since the Maas## tri## cht Treat## y , in order to perpetu## ate them , solemn## ly and for the long term ; provision## s that constitut## e s## o man## y obstacle## s to even the partial implement## ation of s## uch a European project . 
I refer in particular to the key principle## s of the open market econom## y in which competit## ion is free ; to the fact that the European C## ent## ral Bank can no long## er have liberal statute## s or a liberal mission ; to the Commission &apos;## s discretion## ary power## s as regard## s competit## ion or in## de## ed the blatant sub## ordination of all European securit## y and defence policy to the policy form## ed with## in NA## TO . 
new provision## s are add## ed to th## ose old one## s , there## by widen## ing s## till further the gulf separat## ing the con## cept of Europe that is be## ing construct## ed from the one that I have just mention## ed . 
the draft Treat## y thu## s contain## s an article which call## s , in the fi## ery spirit of the multilateral agree## ment on invest## ments , for the remo## val of restrict## ions on foreign direct invest## ment and of other danger## ously ambigu## ous article## s re## l## ating to life patent## ing or in## de## ed to cultural divers## ity . 
in all of these field## s , what we need is not a propag## anda campaign that brook## s no contradict## ion , but a frank , public , plural## ist review of the experience of re## cent year## s which ha## s led to a break## down of trust between the citizen## s and the European institution## s . 
as for the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , it does not say a word about the part of the draft constitutional Treat## y devote## d to the poli## cies and function## ing of the Union , which in fact account## s for two thir## d## s of the whole text . 
we are there## fore oppose## d to this report , just as we are oppose## d to the draft Constitution## al Treat## y it## self . 
o## nce again , how## ever , I wish to make it clear that the &apos; no &quot; that man## y of us are say## ing is open to alter## native suggest## ions . 
it is a European &apos; no . &quot; 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , there is one word mis## s## ing from this Constitution , and that word is &apos; sovereign## ty . &quot; 
it ha## s be## en replace## d by the word &apos; ident## ity , &quot; which is not at all the same thing . 
in the four corner## s of the earth , as we well know , there are people## s who have strong ident## ities and who right## ly claim sovereign## ty , s## uch as the Palestinian## s , the Iraq## is and man## y other## s . 
in Europe , there will now be people## s who , at a time when the## y are at risk of los## ing the## ir ident## ities with Tur## key set to join the EU , will lose the## ir sovereign## ty when the Constitution come## s in## to force . 
one word ha## s dis## appear## ed , the word &apos; sovereign## ty , &quot; and an## other ha## s appear## ed , the word &apos; law , &quot; European law , a word that is the ver## y symbol of national demo## cracies . 
there is there## fore going to be a European law , hence## forth on a high## er legal level th## an national law## s , even constitutional law## s . 
our Constitution , there## fore , for e## ach of our people## s , will become the equi## valent of the internal regulation## s of a region of Europe . 
this European , supranational law will from now on be adopt## ed by major## ity and not un## anim## ously . 
there is there## fore no long## er any opportun## ity for a particular people to voice it## s op## position , even if this is a matter of defend## ing it## s vital interest## s . 
t## hirdly , this supranational European law will be drawn up by a Bru## ssels bureau## cracy that ha## s had the attribut## es of a State confer## red on it . 
that bureau## cracy is be## coming a full @## -## @ scale international play## er , with the right to conclude international agree## ments , with a minister for foreign affair## s ; th## ose word## s do not lie . 
it will enjoy the transfer to it## s remit of the power## s of a super## state - the capacity to draw up law## s , to define public service## s and to address matter## s re## l## ating to im## migration and border## s . 
at the same time - and this will be my last point - national demo## cracies will be trample## d under## foot . 
national parliament## s are having the## ir capacity to make law## s re## mov## ed from them . 
to compens## ate for this , the## y have be## en give## n the right to deliver opinion## s . 
. 
Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteur## s for under## taking the ver## y difficult task of try## ing to find some area## s of agree## ment on the Treat## y in the ver## y divers## e institution and au## gust body that this Parliament is . 
how## ever , in one sense the debate ha## s mov## ed on , be## cause it is now up to the Member State## s and the debate on the Treat## y @## -## @ rat## ification process that take## s place in the Member State## s . 
it is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discuss## ion and the final verdict on this Constitution## al Treat## y will be . 
man## y time## s when we s## peak about the issue## s involve## d , in spite of our best ef## fort## s , some of us would like to see new thing## s add## ed to what ha## s al## read## y be## en agree## d . 
there## fore , we are fight## ing the next argument ra## ther th## an deal## ing with the current debate . 
in add## ition , when you listen to some of the debate , it is like going back to the futur## e , be## cause the same issue## s and point## s that we## re ra## ised in op## position to the first treat## ies in the 19## 50## s , and to the second and sub## sequent treat## ies in the 19## 70## s and 19## 80## s , are be## ing re## hash## ed . 
people are say## ing that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away . 
let us be realistic about what is in this Treat## y and what is good and bad about it . 
as a bas## is for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the futur## e , it is a ver## y good document . 
it ens## ures there will be proper respect and trust for the Member State## s and for the## ir role## s with## in it , in particular for the small## er Member State## s ; it clear## ly set## s down in the doctri## ne of confer## ral who ha## s the power to do what and where the line## s of demarc## ation are drawn . 
when the people who oppose this Treat## y and have oppose## d other treat## ies say that this will over## ride national law , this issue ha## s al## read## y be## en decide## d . 
back in the 19## 60## s in the European Court of Just## ice , the prim## acy of European law over national law was br## ought in## to be## ing . 
how## ever , the Treat## y clear## ly define## s that and narrow## s down that role , name## ly that it on## ly operate## s for European law . 
the European institution## s and European law## maker## s have be## en give## n the power by the Member State## s to make that law . 
s## o let us have a real and honest debate . 
let us move away from the lies , the fear and s## care## monger## ing that take## s place . 
some people will be just## ified in op## posing this Treat## y be## cause of the## ir political belief## s , ide## ologies or the## ir genuine concern## s about what it mean## s for th## ose Member State## s . 
but let us ensu## re that the debate is bas## ed on fact , truth and the written text and not on mis## conception## s . 
Mr President , though this House , in self @## -## @ congratul## atory euphoria , will embrac## e this Constitution , thank## fully the ultimate decision rest## s with the Member State## s . 
it is the## ir vot## es that re## ally matter . 
what I despise most is the false pretence , particular## ly pre## valent in the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , that this Constitution is mer## e## ly a tidy## ing @## -## @ up exerc## ise ma## de necess## ary by enlarge## ment and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generation## s . 
that is demonst## r## ably false . 
th## ose who peddle that de## ception are best expose## d by the Constitution &apos;## s own most ard## ent and more honest proponent## s . 
in the Constitution## al Affair## s Committee , I have observ## ed at first hand the strate## gy and schem## ing of arch Euro## phile## s . 
the## y make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in it## self , but a work in progress and the## y do nothing to conceal the## ir ambit## ion to have it , in the## ir term## s , strength## ened at the first opportun## ity - with## out , of course , the trouble## some obstacle of further national consult## ation . 
the## ir un## disguise## d can## d## our give## s the lie to th## ose who would deceiv## e vot## ers in## to think## ing that this is a mer## e tidy## ing @## -## @ up exerc## ise : it is not . 
the cho## ice for the nation @## -## @ states is this : a cho## ice between a Europe of co## oper## ating sovereign nation @## -## @ states , or a Europe that is it## self a super## state . 
de## spite all the deni## al## s , this Constitution is a frame## work for super## state## hood . 
it declare## s it## s sup## rem## acy over national constitut## ions ; it proclaim## s the sub## serv## ience of national law ; it appoint## s it## s own p## resident and foreign minister . 
it releg## ate## s national parliament## s to mer## e consult## ative sound## ing board## s ; it trade## s mean## ing## ful demo## cracy for the pseudo @## -## @ demo## cracy of this House ; it neuter## s the last defence of the nation @## -## @ state by increas## ing## ly supplant## ing the national veto with radical## ly increas## ed qualified major## ity vot## ing ; and it provid## es an un## bridl## ed path to further integration by permit## ting amend## ment by head## s of govern## ment ra## ther th## an by the people . 
any## one with pride in hi## s or her own nation , who does not want to see it subsume## d in## to a hide## ous conglome## rate , will reject this ta## w## dry Constitution . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , what we have be## en give## n here is a Constitution## al Treat## y found## ed on the work of a Convent## ion compose## d large## ly of parliament## arian## s , and , as it was the## y who ma## de this break## through possible , the development of Europe is no long## er in the hand## s of diploma## ts . 
nine## ty per cent of the draft produce## d by the Convent## ion th## en w## ent through the Inter## governmental Con## ference , and I believ## e that it was this method , involv## ing the people## s of Europe through the## ir elect## ed represent## ative## s , that was cruc## ial in term## s of the progress ma## de . 
not every## thing in this constitut## ion is perfect , but I think the decisive thing is that it is better th## an what we have at present . 
this Constitution## al Treat## y reinforce## s the citizen## s in the## ir right## s ; the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s will give them entitle## ments and safeguard## s . 
it strength## ens citizen## s &quot; right## s be## cause , in futur## e , the elect## ion of the President of the Commission will be direct## ly dependent on the vot## es of the European Parliament . 
the public &apos;## s hand is strength## ened bo## th by the refer## endum and by extend## ing the right## s of the European Parliament . 
this Constitution ha## s become more trans## parent , be## cause it make## s the al## location of power## s and respons## ibil## ities clear## er , there## by making procedure## s more read## ily comprehens## ible , and be## cause the Council is , at least when taking decision## s on law## making , require## d to meet in public . 
the extens## ion of major## ity decision @## -## @ making may well not be sufficient , but it is consider## able , and it does make the European Union more efficient , some## thing that is ap## parent in other area## s , for ex## ample , in the remo## val of the pillar## s structure and the introdu## ction of a s## ing## le legal personal## ity , and , in particular , in the substanti## al improve## ments ma## de in the field## s of foreign , securit## y and defence poli## cies . 
our Europe is found## ed upon value## s . 
the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , which I regard as draw## ing to a high degree on the Christ## ian conception of what human## ity is , is - or s## o I believ## e - one of it## s wonder## s . 
having be## en draft## ed by a pre## vi## ous Convent## ion , the marvel## lous thing about it now is that s## o man## y people## s can take s## uch a common bas## is of value## s as the## ir guide and that th## ose who make our law## s in futur## e must look to see that these value## s are adhere## d to - and this is legal## ly bind## ing ra## ther th## an a matter of policy . 
we want this Europe of our## s to be a communit## y , and that is what the Convent## ion want## ed . 
now , as we move to make the Constitution work , we have to attach high priorit## y to what the Convent## ion want## ed be## ing retain## ed , with## out it be## ing alter## ed by a technocrat## ic approach to it## s implement## ation . 
even now , we have a Fo## reign Service on which to practise , and we are const## ant## ly hear## ing of attempt## s al## read## y be## ing ma## de in the corridor## s of countries &quot; foreign mini## s## tries to contest the Commission &apos;## s power## s - and hence also th## ose of the European Comm## un## ity and it## s Parliament - as a mean## s to## ward## s establish## ing a new inter## governmental author## ity . 
in the way it is represent## ed a## broad , too , the European Union is a Comm## un## ity , and we see this in it## s foreign relation## s , in development and in man## y other area## s of activity , and this must not be change## d by the technocrat## ic way these are share## d out in a foreign service . 
here we have f## ought to secure substanti## al right## s for the Commission , with## out who## s## e consent nothing happen## s , and I would point out to it and to the Council that we will keep a ver## y close eye on this . 
the way in which Europe &apos;## s power## s and respons## ibil## ities are order## ed make## s clear that th## ose power## s and respons## ibil## ities are confer## red by the Member State## s , and it is for this reason that all this talk of a super## state is complete non## sense . 
the fact is that sovereign## ty continu## es to be vest## ed in the Member State## s , and every compete## nce not express## ly define## d as be## ing European remain## s with them . 
in this respect , this Constitution surpass## es any## thing else we have had ; as the opponent## s of a super## state argue that N## ice is wor## s## e , it is the## y who must s## ure## ly be in favour of the Constitution . 
that is the truth of the matter , and s## o I would ask Mr Alli## ster and Mr de V## illi## ers to take an open @## -## @ mind## ed look at the way thing## s are and not tell the## ir vot## ers and the public thing## s that are not tru## e . 
this Europe seek## s to pool sovereign## ty where we as individual states are too weak to go it al## one . 
what this mean## s is that we do not want to take sovereign## ty away ; on the contr## ary , we want to re## claim it for our citizen## s where we can## not act other## wise . 
now that the ts## un## ami ha## s s## truck , we can see that the nation @## -## @ states can no long## er help on the## ir own , be## cause it is beyond us , and that is why our people## s need to be give## n additional strength through our standing together in order to have a chance of surviv## al in this global## ised world order . 
that , after all , is the whole point of this European enter## prise , who## s## e tradition## al object## ive ha## s be## en to make war in Europe im## possible - an object## ive of which we must not lose sight . 
at the same time , the citizen## s , states and people## s must retain the## ir own ident## ities . 
in the futur## e , too , I would like , as a Germa## n , to be able to get ang## ry when we lose at football to the Dutch . 
we want to retain our ident## ity . 
it is in divers## ity that our wealth is to be found . 
that can## not mean , though , that we do not take joint action in situ## ations in which our strength depend## s on our standing together . 
we should see to it that the Constitution is success## fully ratifi## ed . 
domestic , day @## -## @ to @## -## @ day policy must not be allow## ed to decide how the Member State## s and the## ir part## ies hand## le the rat## ification process ; what is , in## stead , decisive is the histo## ric moment , in which it will become ap## parent where the states## men are in the Member State## s , mov## ing the process of rat## ification forward . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I congratul## ate Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go on the## ir out## standing report . 
this Constitution is in## de## ed our bab## y , and even if it does have a few flaw## s , there are no if## s or but## s in our commit## ment to it . 
we want it to grow and flourish . 
let me say , second## ly , that the great## est challenge for the European Union is not Turk## ish member## ship in twen## ty year## s &quot; time , but the rat## ification of the European Constitution in two . 
it is by that that histo## ry will judge us , and - let me say - not just the politic## ians , but also the people## s of Europe . 
I have con## fidence in the people## s &quot; intellig## ence , and in that of the## ir parliament## s . 
in two year## s &quot; time , the Constitution will be in place . 
after all , what will happen if it is not ? 
th## ose who believ## e that the status quo under the Treat## y of N## ice will continu## e to prevail in Europe are hank## er## ing after an illusion . 
Europe will not shake it## self down in## to a core Europe and a fringe Europe , either ; on the contr## ary , with## out a European Constitution , the European Union will de## generate in## to a patch## work Europe , con## fusing the public at home and destroy## ing Europe &apos;## s cred## ibility in the eye## s of the world . 
it would be cris## s @## -## @ cross## ed by the axe## s and alli## ance## s of what would claim to be strategic partner## ships . 
if the Constitution fail## s , we will revert to a Europe of plot## s and counter @## -## @ plot## s , the old Europe , and it is precise## ly that that we do not want . 
the Constitution bring## s to an end twelve year## s of intermittent reform , which have take## n us from Maas## tri## cht to N## ice via Amsterdam and from 12 to 15 , and th## en to 25 , Member State## s . 
now at last , Europe can again give it## s full attention to the political challenge## s of the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury , which are enormous . 
we do , though , have a new bas## is on which to do this . 
the 25 different people## s , all of whom want to retain the## ir ident## ity - and will do s## o - who robb## ed and murder## ed e## ach other , wage## d war on e## ach other and laid e## ach other waste for cent## ur## ies ; these 25 people## s are now in## dis## sol## ub## ly unit## ing the## ir political desti## nies . 
no s## uch thing ha## s be## en done be## fore in Europe &apos;## s histo## ry or that of the world . 
that is what make## s our fight for this constitut## ion s## o worth## while . 
let me say , four## th## ly , that European un## ification was , for fif## ty year## s , an in## ward @## -## @ look## ing affair , focus## s## ing on the access## ion and integration of new Member State## s . 
from now on , it must look out## ward## s . 
Europe is not a world power , but it does have a world power &apos;## s respons## ibility , and that respons## ibility we have to be able to live up to . 
the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury will present European## s with immens## e challenge## s : global## ised business and financial flow## s , international terrorism , climate change and the disaster## s associate## d with it , and the flow of migrants . 
a new world order is coming in## to be## ing - not in ten year## s &quot; time , but now ! 
economic## ally s## peak## ing , Europe is - s## till - a global play## er . 
political## ly s## peak## ing , we are in the regional league . 
if we European## s do not face up to these challenge## s now , we will be exit## ing the s## tage of world histo## ry - political## ly at first , and th## en - inevit## ably - economic## ally . 
that is not the Europe for us to leave to our child## ren . 
Europe &apos;## s respons## e to global## isation is the un## ity of it## s people## s . 
that is our respons## e to the challenge## s of the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury . 
let me conclude by say## ing that the Constitution provid## es two gui## d## ing light## s for the European Union &apos;## s action## s in the futur## e . 
in the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , the Constitution affirm## s that the EU exist## s not on## ly to guarantee the free## dom## s of the market , but also s## o that the citizen## s may enjoy the free## dom## s to which the## y are entitle## d . 
Article 3 of the Constitution commit## s the EU to work## ing to## ward## s peace , securit## y and the sustain## able development of the earth , thu## s affirm## ing that the Union bear## s respons## ibility for our planet ra## ther th## an exist## ing for it## s own sake . 
free## dom for human## ity and respons## ibility for the world - from these grow## s the new Europe &apos;## s ident## ity . 
. - Mr President , the American public## ist Jere## my Ri## f## kin re## cent## ly wrote a book about the European Union and entitle## d it &apos; The European D## re## am . &quot; 
I am grat## e## ful to the President for making it possible for Mr Ri## f## kin to be with us this afternoon , and for giving us the opportun## ity to discuss with him the futur## e of Europe and of the European ideal . 
this book is a dazz## ling ana## lysis of the achiev## e## ments and innov## ations of fif## ty year## s of European un## ification , which are tru## ly un## ique and to be found no## where else in the world : direct elect## ions in 25 countries to one parliament ; a court of law cap## able of hand## ing down ruling## s for all citizen## s and all states ; one s## ing## le curr## ency in twelve countries , en## ab## ling us to defend our economic sovereign## ty at a time of global## isation ; and , now , a European constitut## ion on the table be## fore us . 
this is some## thing of which European## s should be proud ; the## y re## ally should take great pride in what ha## s be## en achiev## ed . 
it is , how## ever , glar## ing## ly ap## parent that s## uch a euphoric ana## lysis is the product of observ## ation from out## side Europe , for the European Union evoke## s astonish## ment and admir## ation from a## round the world : in Africa - having heard President Mbeki &apos;## s speech to this House , we know what expect## ations are plac## ed in Europe ; in Asia , where Europe is giving extra## ordinary help to deal with the present disaster ; and also in America , bo## th North and South . 
I some## time## s wish there we## re less small @## -## @ mind## ed## ness , less fear## ful## ness and less sceptic## ism with## in the European Union . 
ra## ther th## an be## ing afraid of the project of European un## ification , we should hold our head## s high with pride . 
we are a model , and a model secure## d by the European Constitution . 
some of Europe &apos;## s dream## s have al## read## y come tru## e . 
we s## till have work to do on the other## s . 
as ha## s al## read## y be## en s## aid , the found## ing father## s &quot; great dream was that , after a mill## ennium of war , peace would at last be restore## d to the continent , and the EU is the great## est peace project in the world . 
man## y people## s have long## ed for free## dom and demo## cracy . 
let me say it again : the EU is the great## est peace project that there ha## s ever be## en on this continent . 
man## y of th## ose a## round us find the EU ver## y attract## ive and want to join it . 
some dream## s , though , have not come tru## e in a time s## uch as this , in which crime , terrorism and the challenge## s of global## isation are g## na## wing away at the European Soci## al Mode## l . 
I believ## e we will be better able to make the dream of prosper## ity and securit## y a re## ality with this Constitution th## an with## out it . 
s## uch are the big issue## s that have to be explain## ed to people every## where over the coming eigh## teen month## s , as rat## ification is debate## d in the twen## ty @## -## @ f## ive countries . 
the European## s &quot; great dream , the long @## -## @ term go## al## s of this European project and the value## s that under## pin it : these are what we must communic## ate , and we must not allow our## selves to get lo## st in tri## via or detail## s . 
one Member on my committee o## nce s## aid that we must not now count the individual tree## s , the 4## 48 article## s , and pick out one ; in## stead we must look at the whole wood , the project as a whole . 
it is th## en that we come to the conclusion that this is a great leap forward , from a union of states to a union of citizen## s , from diploma## tic Europe to a democratic Europe . 
nothing is set in stone , and there will of course be more stag## es to European un## ification . 
that is what we should be say## ing to all th## ose who are not y## et satisfied . 
I want to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go for pro## duc## ing a re## ally good report , which will prepar## e this House for dia## logue with our partner## s in the national parliament## s and the citizen## s of twen## ty @## -## @ f## ive countries . 
I am glad that the European Constitution owe## s much to this House , from Altiero S## pin## elli &apos;## s &apos; C## ro## cod## ile Club &quot; to the European Constitution Inter## group in the pre## vi## ous and present legisl## ative period## s , in which man## y Member## s have work## ed to achiev## e progress in this area . 
we rejoic## e and are glad that this draft is now on the table . 
we must now do every## thing possible to ensu## re that this draft become## s re## ality ra## ther th## an exist## ing on## ly in black and white . 
there have al## read## y be## en two draft## s ; this thir## d attempt at a European Constitution must see the light of day . 
if , tomor## row , we vot## e for the Constitution by a large major## ity , every## one will go out and fight for it . 
Europe &apos;## s friend## s must not let this histo## ric opportun## ity be take## n out of the## ir hand## s . 
we must not leave the field to it## s opponent## s , who will lead the## ir countries and people## s in## to isol## ation and down a political cul @## -## @ de @## -## @ s## ac . 
. 
Mr President , Parliament &apos;## s Committee on Develop## ment express## ed decisive support for the constitutional text , in the belief that it represent## s histo## ric progress by establish## ing solid## arity with th## ose who need it most , development co## operation and respons## ibility in human## itarian assist## ance , where## ver it is require## d , as defi## ning character## istic## s of the European Union . 
in the opinion of the Committee on Develop## ment , we call for mobil## isation s## o that the Constitution can be ratifi## ed and can enter in## to force as s## oon as possible , and for that mobil## isation to involve th## ose institution## s , N## GO## s and individual## s in Europe who have ma## de North @## -## @ South solid## arity a fundamental cause with## in our political struggle and our social commit## ment . 
let us re## member , there## fore , that the Constitution make## s these value## s of solid## arity and co## operation and human## itarian respons## ibility the European Union &apos;## s distinguish## ing mark## s and that , accord## ing## ly , the## y must transcend all poli## cies and guide all Comm## un## ity action## s . 
the Constitution also mean## s that , in the futur## e , the European Union will have the legal personal## ity we have lack## ed and which will allow us to act as a Union on the international s## tage and particular## ly with## in the real## m of the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
in this way , we will be making consider## able progress with regard to represent## ative## ness , respons## ibility , efficiency and potent## ial , which are particular## ly import## ant in term## s of the European Union &apos;## s pre## s## ence and work in the countries of the develop## ing world and in the field of development co## operation . 
let us not forget that the eradic## ation of p## over## ty in the world is explic## it## ly laid down as one of the European Union &apos;## s constitutional object## ive## s . 
we will end - though this is of particular relev## ance give## n the current circum## stance## s in South## east Asia - by stress## ing that the Constitution provid## es for the creation of a European body of volunteer## s for human## itarian action## s , there## by demonst## rating it## s consider## able time## liness and capacity for anticip## ation . 
. Mr President , in the area of trade policy , this Constitution put## s the European Parliament in a much strong## er position . 
when , as was former## ly the case , the European Parliament &apos;## s democratic control di## d not extend to trade policy , that ga## ve rise to const## ant critic## ism . 
this House di## d not even have to be consult## ed when the autonomous trade legisl## ation was adopt## ed . 
in futur## e , necess## ary measure## s will have to be laid down by European act## s and frame## work legisl## ation , s## o , in principle , Parliament will particip## ate as an equal . 
that is some## thing in which we should take great satisf## action . 
it is s## till , how## ever , a source of anguish that it ha## s s## till not y## et be## en possible to make qualified major## ity vot## ing the norm in the Council . 
on this , the Convent## ion was more advance## d th## an the Inter## governmental Con## ference . 
n## ever## the## less , this Constitution make## s for great## er consist## ency in the trade policy matter## s that we have be## en deal## ing with with## in the W## TO ever since the Uruguay round . 
this Constitution put## s the European Union on a better legal foot## ing for conduct## ing negoti## ations . 
. 
Mr President , for th## ose of us who work to ensu## re that the Union &apos;## s economic resource## s are well spent , this is a good day : all spend## ing is going to be subject to great## er democratic control by Parliament and the Council , and efficiency in spend## ing is going to increas## e , be## cause govern## ability is be## ing increas## ed : we are re## plac## ing veto## es with demo## cracy . 
that mean## s we are going to be able to spend better ; and if the resource## s the citizen## s contribut## e are better spent , we will have more author## ity to ask for more resource## s in order to implement the poli## cies the citizen## s are demand## ing of the European Union . 
it is , there## fore , a great day , a day for be## ing happy to say &apos; y## es , &quot; at a time when , through this Constitution , we are bring## ing the European project to fruit## ion after fif## ty year## s . 
this Constitution bring## s much progress with it ; n## ever## the## less , as our Group President , Mr Po## ette## ring , quit## e right## ly s## aid , it is lack## ing certain thing## s . 
we have be## en timid in term## s of acknowledg## ing our Christ## ian root## s , we have be## en timid in recognis## ing the obvi## ous . 
we have just celeb## rated Christ## mas ; this Parliament will stop at East## er ; here in Strasbourg the most import## ant build## ing is not a build## ing like this one , but a medi## e## val build## ing , a cathedra## l . 
per## hap## s we have be## en victim to a degree of in## toler## ant secular## ism , but Christ## mas , East## er and the Strasbourg Cathedral will s## till be there and there are man## y aspect## s we have be## en able to improve . 
we must , there## fore , say &apos; y## es , &quot; be## cause we believ## e in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolv## e the dai## ly problem## s of the citizen## s . 
we are going to do s## o in the best way : by spend## ing better , control## ling our spend## ing better and having more democratic and effective poli## cies . 
our group and I personal## ly say y## es to the Constitution . 
Mr President , there was a large major## ity of us in the Committee on Em## ploy## ment and Soci## al Affair## s who vot## ed in favour of the new draft Constitution . 
we di## d s## o not be## cause we thought that the propos## al was perfect in all respect## s . 
in## de## ed , we should like to see more decision## s with qualified major## ity vot## ing in the social area . 
I my## self should like to see opportun## ities exist for cross @## -## @ border union right## s . 
we vot## ed in favour be## cause this propos## al in the social area is better th## an the current propos## al . 
we must not turn the best in## to the ene## my of the good when we judge the new draft Constitution . 
let me give a few ex## ample## s of improve## ments . 
first## ly , the object## ive of full employ## ment . 
this is the first time we have this object## ive in any draft for the new Constitution . 
second## ly , the social clause in Part III , which oblig## es the EU to meet the social object## ive## s in all the area## s of compete## nce . 
t## hirdly , the fundamental right## s in the Char## ter of Citizen## s &quot; Right## s , which also include## s union right## s . 
four## th## ly , the strength## ening of the social partner## s &quot; role through recogn## ition of the significance of the social dia## logue and trialogue . 
fifth## ly , the emphasis upon the balance between employ## ment policy and macro## economic policy . 
six## th## ly , the introdu## ction of a legal bas## is for service## s of general economic interest . 
seven## th## ly , the fact that EU citizen## s are now able to take initiative## s . 
the new draft Constitution would make the EU more open , more efficient and more democratic . 
for our## selves who defend the social model , it is quit## e e## asy to support the new draft Constitution be## cause it include## s a long list of improve## ments which will significant## ly improve the opportun## ities for develop## ing the social model in the futur## e . 
. - Mr President , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety ha## s adopt## ed a position with regard to the Constitution , of which I s## hall high## light the follow## ing s## al## ient point## s : we welcome the fact that the implement## ation of the three pillar## s of sustain## able development is a## mong the Union &apos;## s object## ive## s and that environment## al integration and a high level of protection for human be## ing## s have be## en recognis## ed . 
it is a p## ity that the thir## d part re## l## ating to the Union &apos;## s poli## cies and function## ing does not t## ally with the principle of sustain## able development , with## in the s## cope of the poli## cies on agri## culture , cohes## ion , transport and trade . 
certain environment## al measure## s - s## uch as th## ose re## l## ating to tax , town plan## ning , quantitative water manage## ment and land use - could be subject to the ordinary legisl## ative procedure , but in## stead are s## till adopt## ed un## anim## ously by the Council . 
we welcome the adopt## ion of measure## s aim## ed at attain## ing high standard## s of qual## ity and safety of medicine## s and medical de## vice## s . 
measure## s re## l## ating to sur## veil## lance and ear## ly warn## ing system## s in the fight again## st serious cross @## -## @ border health threat## s are also a step in the right direct## ion . 
s## uch measure## s form part of the EU &apos;## s share## d power## s and are there## fore subject to the ordinary legisl## ative procedure . 
we welcome the introdu## ction of a chap## ter on democratic life in the Union , and the principle where## by these position## s must be take## n as trans## parent## ly as possible and in the mann## er that is close## st to the citizen## s . 
further## more , we should like to high## light the import## ance of the Comm## un## ity institution## s &quot; respons## ibility to## ward## s the public , and public access to the court## s and other relev## ant organisation## s , not least in the field of the environment . 
personal## ly , Mr President , I feel that the next step is to discover how the public will take to the new constitutional structure ; how this Constitution , which ha## s be## en creat## ed in a some## what top @## -## @ down fashion , will be receiv## ed and experience## d from the bottom up## ward## s ; and how the principle of equal## ity between State## s and the Comm## un## ity method will be strict## ly guarantee## d in practice . 
on## ly histo## ry will be able to tell us . 
. Mr President , al## though Mr Le## in## en ha## s enjoin## ed us to consider the whole forest of the Constitution , and not just individual tree## s , I must , as spokes## man for the Committee on Indus## try , give brief attention to the tree## s of industrial policy , some of which I might wish would grow better th## an the Constitution make## s provision for . 
some significant progress ha## s , though , be## en ma## de . 
the ex## ample I would like to give is that of space policy , for which Europe now ha## s additional power## s ; it may well not sound either particular## ly every## day or convincing , but I am not talk## ing about us comp## et## ing with the American## s or the Russia## ns or the Chi## nes## e or any## one else in s## end## ing our man - or woman - to the moon or to Mar## s . 
ra## ther , what I am talk## ing about is our making use of the mean## s of inform## ation afford## ed by space policy for what we have to do in Europe and also a## round the globe . 
consider , th## en , the great disaster that we now have to deal with : we need better inform## ation and warn## ing system## s , and Europe ha## s the technology to provid## e them . 
consider the day @## -## @ to @## -## @ day problem## s and task## s in connect## ion with inform## ation and navig## ation that our Ga## lileo ha## s to deal with , and , final## ly , let us give thought to securit## y policy . 
we can## not deploy our troop## s with## out the inform## ation the## y need be## ing provid## ed from space . 
if we want a proper policy of milit## ary securit## y a## round the world , th## en we also need a proper space policy , with an emphasis on civil## ian and peace## ful use , and for that the Constitution provid## es additional possibil## ities . 
for that reason , the Indus## try Committee , too , fully and whole## hearted## ly support## s the European Constitution . 
. 
Mr President , it go## es with## out say## ing that I must begin by congratul## ating the rapporteur## s on the## ir excel## lent report . 
I have had the honour of be## ing draft## s## man of the opinion for this report for the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment and I would like to say that the debate on this issue ha## s be## en ver## y posit## ive and intens## e , be## cause , a## mong## st other thing## s , we must re## member the essential role play## ed by regional and local administ## rations in European integration . 
and it is also essential to re## member that the European Constitution recognis## es local and regional auto## nomy as an integ## ral part of the national ident## ity of the Member State## s . 
this mean## s that , a## mong## st other thing## s , the European Constitution guarantee## s the in## viol## ability of the current border## s of the State## s making up the current European Union . 
today , how## ever , on the subject of the Constitution and the region## s , I would also like to condemn the fact that , in a region of Europe , a S## pan## ish region , the Bas## que Count## ry , the exclus## ive national## ist govern## ment of that Auto## nom## ous Comm## un## ity want## s to implement a rupt## ur## ist , s## e## cession## ist and in## dependent## ist plan , the Ibarretxe Plan , which is a direct attack on the S## pan## ish Constitution and the European Constitution . 
be## cause Ibarretxe and hi## s govern## ment , who call them## selves democrat## s , have ma## de a pact with the murder## ers of ET## A and Batasuna to bring this plan in## to be## ing ; the## y have ma## de a pact with an organisation which is on the European Union &apos;## s list of terrorist group## s , Batasuna , and the Bas## que Nation## alist Part## y ha## s ma## de a pact and an alli## ance with criminal## s , with murder## ers : in short , with the en## emi## es of Europe . 
at this point , I am convince## d that this Constitution is also going to put an end to in## dependent## ist , rupt## ur## ist and s## e## cession## ist propos## al## s s## uch as the Ibarretxe Plan and I am s## ure that the new Constitution will represent an in## surmount## able obstacle to this Ibarretxe Plan and to any## body who want## s to dis## member the European Union . 
. Mr President , Commission## er , ever since the advent of the common agri## cultural policy near## ly half a cent## ury ago , the European Parliament ha## s be## en li## ttle more th## an a consult## ative body when it come## s to the making of law## s . 
right up to now , the Council ha## s be## en able to take decision## s with## out reference to Parliament , and over half the European Union &apos;## s Budget is dispos## ed of with## out any democratic control . 
this is some## thing that the European Parliament , and the Committee on Agri## culture in particular , have n## ever accept## ed . 
un## official## ly , we have found ways of delay## ing final vot## es as a mean## s of forc## ing the Council in## to a sort of co## decision . 
we have also done ster## ling work on hand## ling s## uch cris## es as B## SE , which mean## s that our be## ing con## cede## d co## decision in principle is some## thing we have , to some ex## tent , earn## ed , and that is some## thing we welcome . 
it ha## s to be clear to us , though , that a number of point## s remain to be rect## ified . 
in one article in particular , the Council ha## s reserv## ed to it## self the right to vot## e on quota## s , price## s and restrict## ions on quant## ity , with## out , this time , consult## ing Parliament at all . 
we s## till , th## en , have much to do in the futur## e . 
we will s## till have to draw on our creat## ive power## s in order to exert our democratic influence in these matter## s and in get## ting it stated , in principle , that agri## cultural policy will be subject to co## decision . 
if it is , though , Parliament will be give## n more respons## ibility , and I hope that this House will continu## e , as be## fore , to give the interest## s of agri## culture and of r## ural area## s the attention the## y deserve . 
. 
Mr President , Member## s of the Committee on Fish## eries are well attune## d to opinion in Europe &apos;## s coast## al and is## land communit## ies . 
that committee , in a near un## anim## ous decision , endorse## d my opinion on this Constitution . 
the most import## ant paragraph in that opinion , which will be re## table## d tomor## row for vot## ing as Amendment No 13 on be## half of my Group , refer## s to exclus## ive compete## nce . 
it &apos; consider## s that with## in the con## text of the other exclus## ive compete## nce## s of the EU , which are detail## ed in the Constitution , the inclus## ion of the conserv## ation of marine bio## logical resource## s is anoma## lous and un## just## ified &apos; . 
the common fisher## ies policy ha## s not be## en one of the European Union &apos;## s success st## ories . 
decision @## -## @ making is too centralise## d , too in## flex## ible and too remote from the communit## ies that it affect## s . 
to entrench the CFP effective## ly in prim## ary constitutional law is a major step in the wrong direct## ion and one that will - I believ## e - be an obstacle to the kind of major reform## s demand## ed by the fish## ing communit## ies that I am familiar with . 
exclus## ive compete## nce take## s the CFP out## with the principle of subsid## i## arity , ens## uring that regional advis## ory council## s can n## ever evolve in## to manage## ment bodies . 
I hope that colleague## s will support Amendment No 13 tomor## row and support the fish## ing communit## ies , as the Fish## eries Committee of this Parliament ha## s done . 
these communit## ies strong## ly believ## e that exclus## ive compete## nce is not on## ly un## necess## ary but is in## de## ed anoma## lous and un## just## ified . 
. Mr President , I too would like to warm## ly congratul## ate bo## th rapporteur## s , particular## ly on the way in which the## y structure## d the## ir report , in which there is li## ttle room for us on the Lega## l Affair## s Committee to make further improve## ments , al## though what we have propos## ed ha## s be## en in## corporate## d , and for that I am ver## y grat## e## ful . 
we , in the Lega## l Affair## s Committee , will , though , be deal## ing with the issue## s of special interest to us in an own @## -## @ initiative report , particular## ly the reform of legal instrument## s and of the law## making process , the principle## s of subsid## i## arity and proportion## ality , and the innov## ations in the justice system . 
I believ## e that an## other issue that will demand our attention in the futur## e is that of how we can guarantee coher## ence between part## s I and III of the Constitution . 
this opinion by the Lega## l Affair## s Committee does of course concentr## ate on the re## arrange## ment of the Union &apos;## s instrument## s of action , of which there is at present a veri## table ple## thora : the Convent## ion count## ed 35 different type## s of them . 
I would like to pay trib## ute to it## s V## ice @## -## @ President , Giul## iano Ama## to , who achiev## ed great thing## s as chair## man of the Work## ing Group on Simpl## ification , some## thing that all th## ose present who we## re involve## d in that Work## ing Group will be able to confirm . 
the## y can all , in any case , take pride in the## ir own contribut## ions . 
that much about this European Constitution is un## ique as ha## s al## read## y be## en s## aid ; I also contend that some## thing else that is un## ique is the amount of simpl## ification that this Constitution ha## s en## able## d us to achiev## e and the amount of bureau## cracy it ha## s en## able## d us to do away with . 
I am think## ing on## ly of the constitutional reform process## es that are going on in Austria and Germa## ny at the moment . 
I also see this as proof that the EU is not the bureau## cracy it is al## ways depict## ed as be## ing ; on the contr## ary it is ver## y much an institution cap## able of reform## ing it## self and ha## s show## n it## self to be more s## o th## an not a few nation states . 
our legisl## ative instrument## s will in futur## e be simpl## e and read## ily distinguish## able from administ## rative instrument## s - and , when the Constitution is in place , much else about our live## s will be s## o much easi## er . 
I also believ## e that , al## though these change## s are less spectacular th## an some of what is going on in the institution## s , the## y play a ver## y import## ant part in making the EU more democratic and bring## ing it close## r to the people . 
. - Mr President , I congratul## ate the Member## s who have drawn up this import## ant report . 
the Committee on Civil Lib## er## ties , Just## ice and Home Affair## s found it a pleas## ure , a great pleas## ure , to approve the revise## d content## s of the Constitution## al Treat## y , be## cause sever## al issue## s re## l## ating to the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice will at last be address## ed in a new way in keeping with people &apos;## s demand## s : clear## ly , when one talk## s of free## dom one is talk## ing of the most import## ant thing in life for e## ach one of us . 
there remain , how## ever , certain aspect## s - which I s## hall high## light - that the Civil Lib## er## ties Committee examin## ed but which left us some## what perplex## ed , al## though with## out detract## ing from our pleas## ure and hence our desir## e to have this report adopt## ed un## anim## ously by this Parliament . 
n## ever## the## less , the Civil Lib## er## ties Committee was ver## y pleas## ed to issue a favour## able opinion and there## fore , on be## half of the Civil Lib## er## ties Committee , I call on all Member## s to express the## ir approval of the Constitution## al Treat## y tomor## row . 
Mr President , the La## eken De## clar## ation right## ly call## ed for the EU institution## s to develop in a way which br## ought them close## r to the people . 
as the rat## ification process on the Constitution gather## s pace , it must be s## aid that th## ose ambit## ions clear## ly have not be## en realis## ed . 
as a member of the Convent## ion , I ma## de great ef## fort## s to try to persuade my colleague## s that the e## mer## ging draft was wrong for Europe in principle and wrong for Europe &apos;## s citizen## s . 
I argu## ed through## out that Europe di## d not need a constitut## ion but a simpl## ifying treat## y . 
that would have be## en en## ough to modernise the institution## s and the work## ing## s of the Union . 
I even submit## ted a draft of a possible alter## native . 
Pr## ime Minister Blair agree## d with me th## en ; now he embrac## es the Constitution as it ha## s be## en drawn up . 
there is nothing anti @## -## @ European in op## posing the Constitution . 
how## ever , Brit## ish Con## serv## ative## s and other colleague## s in the P## PE @## -## @ DE Group think that it centralise## s more power## s , make## s the institution## s more remote and reduce## s the power## s of nation @## -## @ states . 
Europe ha## s mis## s## ed an histo## ric opportun## ity to modernise it## s work## ing## s to meet the demand## s of an enlarge## d and more divers## e Union . 
a simpl## ifying treat## y could have tackle## d the real issue## s : relativ## e economic decline , fraud and waste , and great## er involve## ment of national parliament## s in the decision @## -## @ making process## es . 
at a time when the gener## osity of people a## cross Europe and the world to## ward## s the victim## s of the ts## un## ami disaster is evident to all , it is in## explic## able why this Parliament is commit## ting a consider## able s## um of money to a programme of even## ts and re## ception## s in support of the European Constitution . 
th## ose fund## s would have be## en better direct## ed to assist## ing in the disaster relief . 
the Constitution is of s## uch far @## -## @ reach## ing significance that it## s re## jection in one or more of the Member State## s in the forth## coming refer## enda would render it void . 
how## ever , ra## ther th## an be## ing total## ly negat## ive , we should regard that out## come - should it occur - as a fresh opportun## ity for us all to establish a modern Union that respect## s and celeb## rates it## s divers## ity and which is account## able by the people and from the people , ra## ther th## an one which demand## s too much conform## ity . 
we live in a ver## y peculiar time in the histo## ry of the unit## ed Europe . 
even though it is ver## y difficult to divid## e the re## cent past in## to section## s , we witness## ed , organise## d and be## came part of s## uch even## ts that clear## ly allow us to draw the conclusion and declare that we have enter## ed in## to a new er## a . 
today , the unit## ed Europe consist## s of 25 Member State## s , and we know that expansion is s## till in progress . 
the unit## ed Europe &apos;## s new face show## s more and more define## d character## istic## s and in order to maintain and pre## serve these trait## s , we now have a Constitution , which is the topic of today &apos;## s present## ation . 
the Constitution prove## s that the unit## ed Europe will be able to meet the legal require## ments of the expansion as well . 
this Constitution allow## s for more opportun## ities to make Europe become the Europe of it## s citizen## s . 
the role of Parliament , who## s## e Member## s are appoint## ed by direct elect## ion , ha## s grown , and we believ## e that the decision## s ma## de by the European Parliament and the national parliament## s should and will be built upon e## ach other . 
thu## s , the range of norm## s that pertain## s to the whole of the Comm## un## ity may extend in the long run , e## special## ly in the area of social issue## s . 
Hung## ary had al## read## y ratifi## ed the Constitution at the end of last year . 
how## ever , this document that is on the age## nda today is ver## y import## ant to us as well . 
there have be## en concern## s that inform## ation ha## s be## en suspicious## ly with## held . 
I firm## ly believ## e that we do not with## hold inform## ation and we do not have any secret## s , we have nothing to hide . 
it seem## s as if we have to force inform## ation on the European political system## s and citizen## s of Europe . 
it require## s certain knowledge to be a European citizen and to be democratic . 
in the s## o @## -## @ call## ed Lisbon process , we need to be familiar with the norm## s of the Constitution , it## s social norm## s and also know that norm## s require more and more guarantee## s in order to build a social Europe , strength## en solid## arity and secure social tolerance . 
the Constitution is our basic law , but as man## y have s## aid be## fore , it is not a final document set in stone . 
let me mention two area## s that reflect our futur## e challenge## s . 
first## ly , the challenge of a multi## cultural Europe . 
what I mean by this is not the question of Islam , but the challenge that our Europe is religious and secular . 
second## ly , the question of minor## ity issue## s . 
d## uring the rat## ification debate , the Hung## arian parliament urge## d that minor## ity right## s should be strength## ened in communit## y legisl## ation . 
I believ## e that our common European citizen## ship is the key to over## coming discrimin## ation and the in## securit## y of national ident## ity . 
let us take advantage of the opportun## ities provid## ed by European citizen## ship ! 
Mr President , this part @## -## @ session of the European Parliament is of histo## ric significance . 
a motion for a re## solution ha## s be## en table## d on the Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe , and this House , Europe &apos;## s large## st democratic institution , will s## end an import## ant mess## age to the nation## s and citizen## s of Europe by adopt## ing it . 
the re## solution approve## s the Constitution## al Treat## y and call## s for it## s rat## ification . 
adopt## ion of the re## solution will be an opportun## ity for all th## ose who believ## e that Europe need## s a Constitution not on## ly to gain inform## ation on the Treat## y , but also to convince Europe &apos;## s citizen## s that it should be adopt## ed . 
in add## ition , I believ## e it will also act as an appeal to the European Commission to become involve## d in convincing European citizen## s of the Treat## y &apos;## s merit## s . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y ha## s be## en the target of much critic## ism in my country , and it di## d not live up to all the expect## ations held of it . 
I have no doubt that , as it stand## s , the Treat## y make## s it possible to strength## en the European Union . 
first## ly , bo## th the Treat## y and the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s enshrine## d there## in state un## ambigu## ously that respect for the dign## ity of the human be## ing is the bas## is of our common value## s , thu## s confirm## ing the significance of our Ju## d## aeo @## -## @ Christ## ian heritage . 
second## ly , the Treat## y strength## ens the role of the Comm## un## ity institution## s , not## ably Parliament , the European Commission and the Court of Just## ice . 
t## hirdly , the Treat## y extend## s citizen## s &quot; right## s and creat## es a European public space . 
four## th## ly , the Treat## y strength## ens the EU by creat## ing the post of EU Fo## reign Minister , and it en## able## s full continu## ity to be achiev## ed by mean## s of long## er preside## ncies , with## out the EU be## ing turn## ed in## to a super## state . 
fifth## ly , it strength## ens the EU as a communit## y of states , nation## s and citizen## s , bas## ed on common value## s and solid## arity . 
this is the kind of EU we need . 
two new Member State## s , Lithuania and Hung## ary , have be## en the first to rat## ify the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
I am s## ure that my country , Po## land , in which the major## ity of citizen## s are in favour of adopt## ing the Constitution## al Treat## y , will also demonst## rate it## s un## equi## vocal support for the Treat## y d## uring the refer## endum . 
I believ## e this should be regard## ed as some## thing significant and , in it## s own way , symbol## ic . 
twen## ty @## -## @ f## ive year## s ago , the Pol## ish Solidar## ity move## ment re## mov## ed the first stone from the Berlin Wall , and our Germa## n colleague## s ought not to forget this . 
fifteen year## s ago , the Round T## able talk## s in Po## land show## ed that it is possible to make the transit## ion from a total## itarian system in## to free## dom with## out any disrupt## ion to international peace . 
this was the begin## ning of the un## ification process in Europe , and the Treat## y represent## s a great opportun## ity for this unit## ed Europe . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the desti## ny of Europe is at s## take . 
I believ## e that I know what that mean## s ; my father surviv## ed the battle of Stalin## grad ; my mother emerge## d from the concentr## ation camp## s at Au## s## ch## witz and D## ach## au . 
are we not all , on this continent , the product## s of an end## less success## ion of perpet## rator## s and victim## s of cease## less viol## ence ? 
that is why I insist that Europe is a promise - a promise ma## de 60 year## s ago on the brink of the abyss that was Au## s## ch## witz , and in the ruin## s of Europe . 
the promise was that national## ism would be over## come , that demo## cracy and the right## s to free## dom would be un## restrict## ed and that Europe would be unit## ed political## ly . 
our action## s must be measur## ed again## st that . 
this Constitution , which the vast major## ity of Green## s will be end## ors## ing , is a great step to## ward this promise be## ing kept . 
it is not the end ; the task## s have not be## en complete## d . 
it is for that reason that we will be vot## ing in favour of it , and of the report as well . 
this Constitution lay## s the found## ations of a European demo## cracy . 
it establish## es the Union as a communit## y of fundamental right## s . 
it## s poli## cies are under## pin## ned by a common code of all @## -## @ embrac## ing value## s and object## ive## s ; for the first time , it declare## s social right## s to be human right## s as tradition## ally under## stood . 
it simpl## ifies the Treat## ies , make## s external action## s subject to international law , make## s the EU more effective and trans## parent , more democratic## ally legitimate , and creat## es the possibil## ity of it## s citizen## s s## har## ing in it## s decision @## -## @ making . 
in## de## ed , it does creat## e some## thing that is a Europe of citizen## s ra## ther th## an the Europe of state chance## ries that o## nce exist## ed . 
that is why we will be vot## ing in favour of it , and that is why I am glad to see Mr Wurtz here to hear me say that I find hi## s critic## ism## s in## comprehens## ible . 
hi## s amend## ment make## s no reference to demo## cracy , even though this Constitution is in## dispens## able if Europe is to be democratic . 
why does he not mention that ? 
he claim## s that social progress is absent , y## et this Constitution , for the first time in the 200 year## s &quot; histo## ry of human right## s , acknowledg## es and enshrine## s social right## s as human right## s in the tradition## al sense of the word ! 
de## spite certain contradict## ions , we have , for the first time , in## corporate## d full employ## ment and the social market econom## y in the list of this Constitution &apos;## s object## ive## s and value## s . 
it is not tru## e to say that we have agree## d to make Europe a milit## ary power . 
the whole process is high## ly question## able . 
the issue of our relation## ship with NA## TO is as y## et un## resolv## ed , and , al## though non## e can s## ure## ly say in what way Europe will emancip## ate it## self , we have ma## de our action## s subject to international law and to the UN Char## ter , while also , and for the first time , making civil conflict prevent## ion a task impose## d by the Constitution . 
you can## not make thing## s s## o e## asy for your## self . 
I am worri## ed about the rat## ification process , but that is not what we have to get through . 
when the p## resident of the Lithuania## n parliament was here , when our Hung## arian colleague## s s## poke , these rat## ification## s took place with## out any inform## ation campaign on the part of the govern## ments and with## out any public debate . 
is that how we want to win the Constitution ? 
we will not do it that way ! 
we have at least nine refer## endum## s a## head of us , and pleas## e can the rapporteur## s , whom I want to congratul## ate and thank , allow us to say that this report is complete## ly un## critical . 
that put## s a question mark again## st the cred## ibility of this House . 
we are not the Inter## governmental Con## ference &apos;## s court poet## s . 
we are not here to s## ing the praise## s of a Constitution that is not with## out it## s defect## s . 
we have not creat## ed a European social order . 
European demo## cracy is in## complete . 
the s## hap## ing of a European peace frame## work s## till call## s for great de## ed## s to be done , and s## o I would have like## d to see us not on## ly vot## e by a large major## ity to adopt this Constitution , but also open up prospect## s for the continu## ation of the constitut## ion @## -## @ making process . 
we in the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance will make our contribut## ion by setting in motion the first citizen## s &quot; initiative , which will demand a first amend## ment to the Constitution , comp## let## ing demo## cracy , peace and the social order in Europe . 
Mr President , in defi## ance of the re## solution pass## ed by the major## ity of my party , the PD## S , and of the major## ity in my group , I support this Constitution . 
to the## ir &apos; no &quot; I say &apos; no . &quot; 
as a social## ist and a convince## d European , I can## not square re## jection of the first European Constitution with my con## science . 
it was through a democratic process that it came in## to be## ing , and that is it## self a first in the histo## ry of the European Union ; I my## self play## ed a part in that as a member of the Convent## ion . 
let me set out the reason## s that have led me to this conclusion . 
for cent## ur## ies , the people## s of Europe have suffer## ed from imperial## istic war## s and bitter anim## os## ities . 
to these we are , as we must , put## ting an end . 
on that the Constitution set## s it## s seal . 
defi## ning the Union as a communit## y of value## s , the Constitution enshrine## s a can## on of value## s rang## ing from the respect for human dign## ity , which is the high## est good , to justice and solid## arity . 
all these value## s I count as my own , and I want to do every## thing I can to see them , in the## ir entire## ty , actual## ly ma## de real in soci## ety . 
the Constitution reinforce## s the right## s of citizen## s ; it make## s the EU distinct## ly more democratic , above all , in## de## ed , present## ing new opportun## ities to creat## e a social Europe . 
the Constitution substanti## ally advance## s European integration , making the European Union as a whole better prepar## ed to face the futur## e . 
the Constitution is significant## ly better th## an the Treat## y of N## ice , by which the Union is at present held together in law . 
my decision also ha## s to do with the fact that the Left , d## uring the course of the Convent## ion , large## ly refrain## ed from contribut## ing any practical propos## al## s of it## s own to the process , and with it## s fail## ure to come up with any real alter## native## s to what it now reject## s . 
I find that un## accept## able . 
whi## lst I would like to see a peace## ful , democratic and social European Union and to see Europe unit## ed , this go## al will elude us un## less we are prepar## ed to make concession## s to one an## other . 
I am convince## d that Europe will n## ever come in## to be## ing if the political fami## lies declare the## ir own standard## s to be point## s beyond which the## y will not go . 
my say## ing &apos; y## es &quot; to the Constitution does not , of course , mean that I wish to gloss over or ignor## e it## s defect## s , and I want to continu## e to contend for change## s in the EU . 
I will , of course , take up the cudgel## s again## st neoliberal poli## cies , and I will also fight again## st all that tend## s to turn the European Union in## to a milit## ary power . 
my particular concern is that we must prevent the European Union from degener## ating in## to an im## age of the power project## ed from America , and from it## s be## ing weaken## ed in economic and social term## s by re## armament . 
Mr President , a blank cheque is a cheque on which the recipient write## s the amount concern## ed . 
a cheque of this kind can be issu## ed in an emerge## ncy , if the sign## atory know## s the recipient ver## y well . 
why , how## ever , re## commend to the elector## ate that it endorse an agree## ment that is to be give## n sub## stance by leader## s we can## not possibly know at present ? 
we do not know whet## her the most import## ant and most sensitiv## e issue## s are to be decide## d un## anim## ously or by qualified major## ity vot## ing . 
the futur## e un## elect## ed prim## e minister## s will them## selves be able to determine how the## y will make decision## s , in## stead of giving the elector## ate the last word . 
nor do we know the content of import## ant article## s in which decision## s are left to the Court of Just## ice . 
in one place , a pledge is give## n on matter## s re## l## ating to countries &quot; social system## s ; else## where , our wel## fare system## s can be vot## ed away on the bas## is of a major## ity decision or a judgment . 
in one place , the status of the national church is maintain## ed ; else## where , the precede## nce take## n by the Dan## ish Constitution in matter## s re## l## ating to the national church is re## mov## ed . 
in one place , national ident## ity is guarantee## d ; else## where , the Constitution ha## s to give way if it is in conflict with a decision by official## s in Bru## ssels . 
in Article III @## -## @ 3## 75 , the Dan## ish Sup## reme Court lose## s the right to decide the limit## s plac## ed upon the EU author## ities . 
in man## y place## s , there is free## dom of cho## ice as to whet## her a bind## ing decision or voluntary co## ordination is to be us## ed . 
thu## s , we do not know what we are suppose## d to endorse . 
it is there## fore wise## st not to endorse any## thing until the amount is stated on the cheque , together with the ident## ity of the recipient , and until we are also give## n the right to cancel the cheque . 
in that way , we s## hall at least know what we are vot## ing on and how we can over## turn a decision . 
constitut## ions are for states . 
between states , agree## ments are ma## de , that is to say treat## ies . 
I want to see a Europe of demo## cracies that solv## es practical problem## s by focus## ing upon cross @## -## @ border issue## s , or matter## s that we can## not solv## e our## selves . 
in that way , we should not be los## ing any## thing in term## s of demo## cracy , but should have every## thing to gain in term## s of co## operation . 
we should th## en have a democratic bon## us in## stead of a grow## ing democratic de## ficit that might end up with the collapse of demo## cracy . 
as the well @## -## @ known poet E## b## be K## l## ø## ver## d## al Re## ich point## ed out , demo## cracy with## out a is simpl## y the exerc## ise of power . 
govern## ment that provid## es no opportun## ity for adjust## ing a country &apos;## s course at the d## ate of the next elect## ion is not demo## cracy , but oliga## rchy . 
Europe deserve## s better , and that is the title of the alter## native statement that I re## commend be adopt## ed in## stead of Mr Corbett &apos;## s and Mr Mén## dez De Vi## go &apos;## s report . 
- Mr President , the Convent## ion , in which this Parliament took part , drew up a text consider## ed at the time to be the best possible compromis## e . 
th## en the Council , in turn , reach## ed the most work## able compromis## e , and the new Constitution## al Treat## y was sign## ed in Rome . 
depend## ing on individual national constitut## ions , it is now a matter for the people , through refer## endum## s , or for the national parliament## s to give final approval to the new path . 
it is a path which , like it or not , regard## s Europe not as a federal super## state that ha## s gradual## ly erode## d away ident## ities , tradition## s and culture## s , but as a Union of sovereign states that have free## ly cho## s## en to breath## e life in## to a common policy . 
it come## s at a time in human histo## ry when natural disaster## s and man @## -## @ ma## de trage## dies require that not just the economic interest## s of our countries be represent## ed on the world s## tage , but also the value## s of demo## cracy , free## dom and respect for human dign## ity - value## s that our continent ha## s secure## d and set out at last after cent## ur## ies of war and conflict . 
if today , in this Chamber , we divid## e over some## thing that no long## er depend## s on our decision , but on rat## ification by the individual Member State## s and individual people## s of the Union , it will mean disavow## ing our Parliament &apos;## s ability to plan the futur## e and releg## ating it to the role of a talk## ing shop in which plen## ty of fine speech## es are ma## de but li## ttle is decide## d . 
that stand## s in stark contrast to the increas## e in our prerogative## s which , after a great struggle , we have final## ly achiev## ed precise## ly through the draft## ing of the new Treat## y . 
it would seem appropriate to recall that , while the value## s and principle## s of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s now include## d in the second part of the Treat## y form the ethical bas## is for the Union , sever## al part## s of the Constitution## al Char## ter are s## till in## complete and will need up## d## ating in the light of current circum## stance## s . 
further## more , we must ensu## re that the Constitution is not exploit## ed for party @## -## @ political purpose## s again## st govern## ments that have be## en du## ly elect## ed by the## ir own citizen## s . 
the European Union must not run the risk of be## coming a place where political group## s join in battle to attack free## ly ma## de national decision## s on ideo## logical ground## s . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , we hear it s## aid that the EU need## s this Constitution if it want## s to deepen integration , but , as we have just heard from one of it## s most forth## right advoc## ate## s , not every## thing in the draft we are to vot## e on is ideal . 
it is , ap## parent## ly , better th## an what we had be## fore , s## o this is progress in any case . 
that actual## ly sound## s pre## tty feeble . 
we are also told , though , that this Constitution will in no way facilit## ate the development of a European super## state ; on the contr## ary , it ap## parent## ly strength## ens the Member State## s in the## ir ident## ities . 
if that is s## o , th## en the citizen## s of Europe &apos;## s states should be give## n a real chance to have the last word in the debate on it## s rat## ification , if at all possible by mean## s of refer## endum## s . 
for that , though , the## y need real inform## ation ra## ther th## an just the one @## -## @ sided propag## anda celeb## rating the Constitution . 
the Constitution &apos;## s weak## ness## es , too , need to be discuss## ed with## out accus## ations of anti @## -## @ European## ism be## ing throw## n a## round : for ex## ample , the fact that small## er Member State## s will have few## er ways to defend the## ir interest## s ; the fact that the European Parliament will continu## e to be a tooth## less tiger , particular## ly in matter## s affect## ing foreign and securit## y policy ; and also the fact that Europe &apos;## s workers are s## till expose## d to the risk of wage and social dump## ing . 
on## ly a frank and open debate on this Constitution &apos;## s flaw## s and danger## s will make it possible for the people## s of Europe and the citizen## s of the EU to see it as some## thing more th## an a Bas## ic Law hand## ed down from on high . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , Commission## er , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , what is at issue in today &apos;## s debate on the European Constitution## al Treat## y ? 
on the other hand , though , this treat## y make## s a multi## tu## de of improve## ments over again## st the treat## ies that we have at present , and that is the compar## ison in which the Constitution## al Treat## y must come out best . 
it bring## s us more demo## cracy , strength## ens the European Parliament , and involve## s the national parliament## s in the law## making process . 
in## stead of weight## ed vot## es , there will be dual major## ity in the Council . 
in## stead of more general clause## s , power## s will be specific## ally confer## red . 
the Commission is to be limit## ed in s## ize , which will help to make it more democratic , and the Constitution## al Treat## y make## s for great## er trans## par## ency , which of course make## s it necess## ary to involve the national parliament## s . 
be## fore we come to decide on some## thing at first read## ing , the national parliament## s will be give## n the chance to say some## thing about it . 
not on## ly in that it make## s for trans## par## ency do I regard that as some## thing import## ant . 
the Council will have to hold it## s meet## ing## s in public . 
we are at last taking leave of the clandestine diploma## cy that ha## s character## ised Europe for over fif## ty year## s . 
to s## um up , what that mean## s to me is that the European Union will be concentr## ating on the task## s it can perform , ra## ther th## an be## coming a super## state . 
even if people s## till need to be more inform## ed and more involve## d , this is s## till , on the whole , a respect## able treat## y . 
I can s## peak for my own party , the CS## U , but also for our colleague## s in the CD## U , when I say that we will vot## e in favour of this Constitution## al Treat## y with## out any reserv## ations . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the re## solution on the European Constitution## al Treat## y ha## s be## en written in a ver## y posit## ive spirit . 
we seem to be commend## ing a flaw## less piece of work , as if we we## re un## aware of it## s weak## ness## es . 
we should not , how## ever , ignor## e the voice## s warn## ing of the short## coming## s of the present draft Constitution . 
we may decide that , de## spite every ef## fort , this Constitution is n## either trans## parent nor comprehens## ible . 
I am also s## truck by the fact that the motion for a re## solution does not allow for much democratic discuss## ion , thu## s brand## ing th## ose who have the## ir reserv## ations about the Treat## y as anti @## -## @ European . 
the European Constitution is a practical instrument that will affect European integration for deca## de## s to come . 
Europe can set out on the road either to## ward## s a bureaucrat## ic federalist super## state , or to## ward## s the political opposite , a liberal and competitive Europe . 
let us make it quit## e clear that adopt## ing or fail## ing to adopt the European Constitution is a pre## domin## ant## ly political matter , and not a pre## requisite for integration . 
it is there## fore entire## ly legitimate to vot## e bo## th for the Constitution and again## st it . 
rat## ification is often portray## ed as an essential step which should not be open to too much discuss## ion . 
advoc## ate## s of the European Constitution some## time## s even threaten that the Union will not allow it## self to be held back by just a few countries not rat## ifying the Constitution , and that these countries will be marginal## ised and will have to content them## selves with some less## er form of affil## i## ation . 
I consider this approach to be ver## y un## fair . 
I have al## read## y repeat## ed## ly refer## red to the risk that democratic principle## s will be violate## d ; I grew up in a political system where a cheer## ful and happy &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e was the on## ly possible cho## ice at every elect## ion . 
I should now like to issue a warn## ing again## st the use of these same principle## s . 
I am not try## ing to target the Constitution## al Treat## y direct## ly . 
I simpl## y wish to emphasis## e the need for open and democratic discuss## ion , and to stress that a fail## ure to adopt the Constitution is not a disaster , nor does it mean an end to the process of integration in Europe . 
on the contr## ary , it might lead to more pro## found consider## ation as to where European integration is head## ing and where the vot## ers would re## ally like to see it . 
thank you for your attention . 
Mr President , Madam V## ice @## -## @ President of the Commission , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , lad## ies and gentle## men , I wish to express my support , on my own be## half and on be## half of the S## pan## ish Socialist## s , for the Corbett @## -## @ Mén## dez de Vi## go report , which mark## s the end of an histo## ric process . 
there have be## en two debate## s on the creation of constitut## ions in the European Union . 
the first was the debate of the Congress of the European Movement in 19## 48 , in which Church## ill , Reyn## aud , Ram## a## dier , van Ze## e## land , Madariaga and Adenauer had the opportun## ity to begin deba## ting a Constitution for Europe . 
Mr President , pleas## e allow me to refer to my country , which will be the first to hold a refer## endum on the rat## ification of the Constitution , with a public and open debate which we believ## e is import## ant for every## body . 
it is tru## e to say that the Za## pat## ero Govern## ment , after win## ning the elect## ions of 14 Mar## ch , un## block## ed the process of ap## prov## ing the Constitution , but I would like to say - and I can## not see any Member of the S## pan## ish People## s &quot; Part## y , and I would there## fore ask the V## ice @## -## @ President of the## ir Group , Mr## s Gross## etête , to communic## ate this on my be## half - that the Convent## ion beg## an with the S## pan## ish Presidency of the Council of Mr Azna## r , and it was he who call## ed for the refer## endum . 
I there## fore believ## e and hope that there will also be decisive support from the S## pan## ish People## s &quot; Part## y - the support of the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s appear## s to be guarantee## d - for the whole of this process . 
I believ## e that in that way we will be able to ensu## re that we have a refer## endum which genuine## ly set## s a posit## ive precede## nt for the refer## endum## s in the other State## s which have decide## d to hold them and that there be a public and open debate . 
I will end by say## ing that this conclude## s a process in which Europe ha## s be## en construct## ed with pass## ion and with good sense , and this ha## s led it to change histo## ry . 
Mr President , any position on the European Constitution must be bas## ed on a balance between what this Constitution say## s and what it does not say - some## thing that is not per## hap## s proper## ly under## line## d in the report we are vot## ing on at this part @## -## @ session . 
this lead## s me to say &apos; y## es &apos; to this Constitution be## cause of what it represent## s and be## cause it mean## s a new step forward on the way to a strong## er and more efficient , more trans## parent , more democratic Europe . 
with this Constitution , Europe will have a strong## er voice in the world . 
citizen## s will get better protection of the## ir fundamental right## s . the## ir free## dom and securit## y will be better defend## ed . 
more## over , our value## s , including th## ose which are be## hind our social and economic model , will be strong## ly proclaim## ed and protect## ed to allow Europe &apos;## s grow## th and , simultaneous## ly , to protect Europe &apos;## s social cohes## ion . 
but that does not prevent me from acknowledg## ing that the text reflect## s the un## fortunate bias of some political major## ities that exist## ed in Europe at the time when it was draft## ed . 
I particular## ly regret that it reflect## s a vi## rtual Europe , a Europe that is not the real Europe , a Europe that does not exist in political term## s , where every## thing that lies between individual citizen## s and states is just ignor## ed . 
people## s in Europe , region## s , and the## ir political role in the construct## ion of a divers## e and plural Europe have simpl## y be## en neglect## ed , have be## en pass## ed over in silence in this text . 
but this is just not the re## ality of the Europe we are all build## ing here together . 
what is wor## s## e , some language## s , s## uch as my own - Cata## lan - which are strong## er th## an acknowledg## ed official## ly at European Union level , are blind## ly ignor## ed in this Constitution . 
some of these problem## s can be solv## ed out## side the Constitution , and some of us will keep fight## ing for that . 
I will there## fore join th## ose who support this posit## ive step forward in the build## ing of Europe and I will strong## ly re## commend a &apos; y## es &apos; in the S## pan## ish refer## endum , al## though I will fully comprehend and respect any other position taking a different view of this balance . 
I will not take this text as some## thing en## grav## ed in stone , but as an improve## ment that allow## s us to keep work## ing for a Europe where all citizen## s and people## s can feel comfort## able , and are acknowledg## ed as the## y re## ally are and want to be . 
Mr President , we European Green## s are in favour of a &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e in the coming refer## endum on the European Constitution in Spa## in . 
we will have the great respons## ibility of holding the ver## y first refer## endum on the continent , and a result express## ing the S## pan## ish citizen## s &quot; firm support for the Constitution will s## end a clear and strong mess## age to the other European countries and will provid## e the im## petus to carry on build## ing the Europe we want to see after rat## ification . 
our &apos; y## es &quot; is a demand## ing &apos; y## es . &quot; 
on the other hand , we are concern## ed and con## fuse## d by the position of the S## pan## ish People## s &quot; Part## y . 
I would ask the question : what ha## s happen## ed to th## ose people who s## aid the## y want## ed to di## e for N## ice , s## uch as Mr Azna## r ? 
I see that the## y are s## till al## ive and kick## ing and that the## y are current## ly creat## ing con## fusion , double language and alarm in relation to the coming refer## endum in Spa## in , put## ting narrow @## -## @ mind## ed party @## -## @ political interest## s above European integration . 
this double language , together with an att## itude of say## ing or do## ing li## ttle in relation to the Constitution , and con## fusing the people with other issue## s which have li## ttle to do with the Constitution , does ver## y li## ttle to promot## e European integration . 
some people are call## ing for a &apos; y## es &quot; with## out any real convict## ion and s## end## ing con## fuse## d and contradict## ory mess## age## s to the## ir own vot## ers , seek## ing on## ly to erode the current govern## ment of Spa## in . 
the demand## ing &apos; y## es &quot; that we Green## s advoc## ate mean## s cho## os## ing to take advantage of the new European political area construct## ive## ly in favour of the social and eco## logical Europe we want . 
the Constitution is not the end of the road , it is not the final desti## nation , and is not even an in## n . 
we believ## e , like Antonio Machado , that the path is ma## de by walk## ing ; we believ## e that this Constitution is a step forward and we will continu## e a## long this road in the futur## e . 
Mr President , I must again point out the wisdom contain## ed in the Norwegian Mountain## eers &quot; Hand## book . in the e## vent of a dis## crep## ancy between the map and the ter## rain , follow the ter## rain . 
other## wise , we end up in trage## dy or farce , some## thing we are well on the way to## ward## s . 
this is due to the fact that , in cruc## ial area## s , the Constitution go## es again## st the democratic intention## s that are invoke## d and correspond## ing## ly depriv## es genuine demo## cracy of vital susten## ance . 
the Constitution involve## s a huge concentr## ation and central## isation of the EU elit## es &quot; political power , e## special## ly over the judic## iary and police . 
the EU Constitution constitut## es a genuine abolition of liv## ing demo## cracy in civil soci## ety , e## special## ly since the expansion of the EU &apos;## s power make## s real democratic control im## possible . 
the on## ly hope in this process lies in the forth## coming refer## endum## s . 
the EU elit## es are try## ing to abolish this ultimate democratic element too . 
demo## cracy is now s## o deep## ly compromis## ed that it is open## ly practise## d as the power of the elit## e to govern the people . 
the fight again## st the EU Constitution is a fight for demo## cracy , and one that we intend to win out## side this House . 
Mr President , it is pre## tty clear that what we are involve## d in here is a one @## -## @ sided exerc## ise in sell## ing this Constitution to the people## s of Europe . 
listen## ing to some of the talk , you would think the Second Com## ing of the Lord was be## ing debate## d . 
start## ing this week , you will be spend## ing large amount## s of tax## payer## s &apos; money tell## ing people what the## y should think and how the## y should vot## e . 
I suggest that first you ought to put your House in order . 
some week## s ago I reveal## ed to this Parliament Commission## er Bar## rot &apos;## s past and the affair was white## wash## ed . 
now it ha## s emerge## d that d## uring hi## s hear## ing , Si## im Kallas , who is in charge of the anti @## -## @ fraud drive , ga## ve de## liberate## ly mislead## ing inform## ation and in## accurate d## ate## s , and us## ed a mis## interpret## ation as a mean## s of s## hy## ing away from a vital question . 
yesterday afternoon , President Bor## rell deni## ed me the chance to make a one @## -## @ minute speech to mention this to Parliament . 
you will not win your constitutional battle by bury## ing the truth and by fail## ing to have a proper debate . 
the whole process will fall y## et further in## to dis## repute , al## though , give## n the fact that I , a## long with man## y colleague## s here , will be campaign## ing for a &apos; no &apos; vot## e , per## hap## s I should be grat## e## ful for the mann## er in which you conduct your## selves . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , there have be## en time## s in the course of this debate when one might have be## en forgiv## en for think## ing that no critic## ism of the Constitution had ever be## en voice## d . 
I believ## e that this will change when the Member## s of this House return to the## ir countries and en## counter divers## e and vari## ed critic## ism of the Constitution from a number of ver## y different quarter## s . 
the Union for Europe of the Nation## s Group , in common with man## y of the other political group## s in this House , is divid## ed on the issue of the Constitution . 
the member## s of Law and Just## ice who constitut## e the Pol## ish element in this group are oppose## d to it , not be## cause it would be a bad thing for Po## land , but be## cause it would be a bad thing for Europe . 
to begin with , the Treat## y alter## s the system accord## ing to which vot## es are count## ed , to the dis## advantage of countries with a particular interest in poli## cies re## l## ating to East## ern Europe , cohes## ion and agri## culture . 
this appli## es to Po## land in all three in## stance## s , of course , y## et it is not the implic## ations for Po## land that are the most significant problem , but the weaken## ing of whole sector## s of European policy . 
the Treat## y strength## ens the EU &apos;## s power## s over economic , employ## ment and social policy with## in the Union . 
it does not y## et go s## o far as to grant exclus## ive compete## nce## s , of course , and no decisive step ha## s y## et be## en take## n . 
n## ever## the## less , it substanti## ally strength## ens the EU &apos;## s power## s . 
y## et it is not harmon## isation of economic policy that Europe need## s , but system## s competit## ion in this field . 
harmon## isation will consign Europe to the margin## s of global competit## ion . 
the Treat## y is a significant step to## ward## s use of the Comm## un## ity method in the field of foreign policy . 
again , no final decision## s have y## et be## en ma## de , but a step ha## s be## en take## n in that direct## ion . 
it is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Comm## un## ity method and the inter @## -## @ state method in foreign policy , and Mr Re## hn , the new Commission## er , admitted as much d## uring hi## s hear## ing be## fore the Committee on Fo## reign Affair## s . 
final## ly , the Treat## y is bas## ed on false pre## mis## es from it## s ver## y first line## s . 
an ex## ample of s## uch false## hood and extreme prejudice is the remo## val from the preamble of reference## s to Christ## ian## ity and God , who## s## e pre## s## ence is s## till felt in the major## ity of the European Union &apos;## s Member State## s . 
these are all reason## s why today we must say &apos; no &quot; to the Treat## y and &apos; no &quot; to this motion for a re## solution in order to say &apos; y## es &quot; to Europe . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , not on## ly is the draft Constitution far from be## ing ideal , it is also far from be## ing the compromis## e it could have be## en . 
th## ose in favour of a Constitution and a better European Constitution would do best to reject this draft , as I am in no doubt that a sub## sequent one would be an improve## ment . 
the member## s of Self @## -## @ De## fence will vot## e in favour of Amendment No 1## 02 , an extreme## ly import## ant amend## ment by Mr Bon## de to which I have put my own name . 
the democratic de## ficit would be increas## ed if national parliament## ary compete## nce## s we## re to be hand## ed over not to the democratic## ally elect## ed European Parliament , but to the un## elect## ed European Commission , and this would be most un## desir## able . 
it would also be un## desir## able to abandon the principle of &apos; one country , one Commission## er . &quot; 
y## et it would be a good idea to hand back to the nation states all matter## s which are not in actual fact of supra @## -## @ national import## ance , and more free## dom and less central## ism is a good principle to follow . 
in conclusion , I should like to say that the member## s of Self @## -## @ De## fence are open to the idea of an EU Constitution . 
we do not reject it as s## uch , but we can## not vot## e in favour of the motion for a re## solution as it stand## s . 
we have doubt## s , and these doubt## s are share## d by million## s of inhabit## ants of the EU &apos;## s Member State## s . 
y## et we are open to dia## logue , as this is what the million## s of inhabit## ants of our countries want . 
we will there## fore abstain from vot## ing in the final vot## e . 
- Mr President , Commission## er , I should first like to congratul## ate the two rapporteur## s , Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , on the## ir remark## able report . 
I should also , how## ever , like to thank Val## é## ry Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing , with## out whom , I am s## ure , we would not be here today deba## ting this histo## ric s## tage in Europe &apos;## s development . 
we are in a position to gauge how far we have come . 
the great## est danger for Europe would be to fall back in## to inter## governmental method## s . 
in## de## ed , we must deplor## e the fact that European govern## ments have not follow## ed all the propos## al## s ma## de by the Convent## ion , the con## sequenc## e of which is that we s## hall gradual## ly have to adapt the Constitution as we go a## long . 
in fact , what we need is more Europe in a global## ised world confront## ed with terrorism , migr## atory flow## s , climate change and major economic disrupt## ion . 
we need more Europe , more Union - a Union bas## ed on our universal value## s - and more demo## cracy . 
the Constitution will bring all of this , strength## ening Parliament &apos;## s role and involv## ing national parliament## s at the same time . 
th## ose reject## ing this Constitution s## peak of Bru## ssels bureau## cracy , of a los## s of national sovereign## ty and of a European super## state . 
for want of argument## s , the## y trot out the same back## ward @## -## @ look## ing slogan## s , which are today de## void of mean## ing be## cause the## y bear no relation to re## ality . 
this is typical of the## ir in## ability to look to the futur## e . 
how else can we explain that all 25 of our govern## ments agree## d to adopt the Constitution ? 
the## y certain## ly di## d not intend to commit . 
be## cause we must work collect## ive## ly together in the service of the European citizen and for futur## e generation## s , we say &apos; y## es &quot; to the Constitution for Europe . 
European## s must cho## ose between insul## arity and para## lysis , on the one hand , and open## ness and modern## ity , on the other . 
the cho## ice is simpl## e - if we want a free and respons## ible Europe , we must rat## ify the Constitution for Europe . 
- Mr President , as a French social## ist and as a European social## ist , I s## hall be vot## ing tomor## row , with e## motion and pride , in favour of the report by the two Member## s of this House . 
I s## hall there## fore turn my speech in## to a trib## ute - a trib## ute to Altiero S## pin## elli , who drew up the first European Constitution in this democratic## ally @## -## @ elect## ed House . 
I n## ever forget that he was a veteran of the young communist## s and I turn to my fellow social## ists and say to them &apos; n## ever forget where you have come from . &quot; 
he was an old anti @## -## @ fascist milit## ant , an old federalist , and I pay trib## ute to th## ose Member## s of Parliament who vot## ed for this draft d## uring the s## itt## ing of 14 Fe## bru## ary 19## 84 . 
Mr Po## ette## ring vot## ed in favour , Mr Hänsch vot## ed in favour , Mr Wurtz vot## ed again## st and Mr Ver## g## è## s vot## ed again## st . 
the## y will do s## o again , loyal as the## y are . 
if you re @## -## @ read the text on which we s## hall vot## e tomor## row , you will notice that it take## s up a number of element## s of that old text . 
let me give you some ex## ample## s . 
Article 3 of the S## pin## elli report enshrine## s the principle of European citizen## ship ; Article 4 , respect for fundamental right## s ; Article 6 , legal personal## ity ; Article 9 , the Union &apos;## s object## ive of full employ## ment ; Article 34 s## peak## s of European law## s ; Article 44 mention## s sanction## s ; Article 82 of Part 4 , which is Part 3 today , s## peak## s of rat## ification , and I could go on . 
what I am try## ing to say is that tomor## row &apos;## s vot## e form## s part of the con## text of this long histo## ry , and that this Constitution ha## s not simpl## y fall## en out of the sky ; it is part of a major historical move## ment . 
the sea## m was first min## ed over 50 year## s ago and yield## ed the raw material of re## conciliation . 
the s## ing## le curr## ency , the euro , which is more th## an ten year## s old , was Germa## ny &apos;## s curr## ency of re## conciliation . 
let us there## fore view this Constitution as a hand proffer## ed to the people## s who have join## ed us again , now that the dark night of total## itarian## ism is over . 
- Mr President , current even## ts demonst## rate that we need Europe now more th## an ever . 
we need Europe to protect us , and to initiate and drive forward an origin## al social model . 
we need Europe to generate grow## th , to co## ordinate our economic poli## cies and to combat un## employ## ment . 
we need Europe to implement a genuine research and development policy , like the one pursu## ed by the Unit## ed State## s . 
we need Europe to protect and pre## serve our environment and , final## ly , we need a Europe that car## ries weight in the world , with milit## ary and civil European defence , and a genuine foreign policy . 
the world &apos;## s balance depend## s on Europe &apos;## s continu## ed exist## ence . 
in order to address this enormous expect## ation we need more effective , more trans## parent and more democratic institution## s . 
we need institution## s that move away from a way of work## ing that is all too often inter## governmental , where## by decision## s are al## ways take## n with## out the citizen## s ever be## ing involve## d . 
we need institution## s that favour Comm## un## ity decision @## -## @ making , be## cause this is the on## ly tru## ly democratic method of decision @## -## @ making . 
we also need strong institution## s , en## ab## ling us to move to## ward## s a more integrate## d Europe , de## spite the timid## ity of the Head## s of State or Govern## ment . 
this is why we support bo## th this excel## lent and well @## -## @ written report and the draft Constitution . 
even if it does not go as far as we would like , this Constitution is a symbol## ic and significant step to## ward## s a more un## ified , strong## er and more democratic Europe . 
we owe that to our citizen## s . 
Mr President , for the Cata## lan Republic## an Left - the - and for the other part## ies in our European coal## ition - for ex## ample from the Bas## que country , Ar## agon and Andalusia - this is not a good Constitution## al Treat## y . 
it does not recognis## e our wish for internal enlarge## ment . 
state## less nation## s will not have any recogn## ition in this Treat## y . 
we would have accept## ed the Treat## y if on## ly it had include## d a small step forward - official @## -## @ language status for the Cata## lan language . 
today , in Parliament , about 2 % of Member## s may not s## peak the## ir mother ton## gue . 
of this 2 % , the vast major## ity of us are Cata## lan speaker## s . 
I am the four## th Cata## lan @## -## @ s## peak## ing Member - after President Bor## rell , Mr Guard## an## s Cam## b## ó and Mr Ham## mer## stein Min## tz - to s## peak here this morning in a language other th## an our own - 
we reject this constitutional Treat## y be## cause we want to be direct## ly involve## d in Europe and want a strong## er , more unit## ed and cohes## ive Europe , built on it## s own divers## ity ; just the opposite of a nation @## -## @ state built on the bas## is of the French model and again## st pluri## lingual## ism , divers## ity and pluri## national## ity . 
work## ing nation @## -## @ states do not make a good bas## is for the construct## ion of Europe . 
Europe should be built on the bas## is of national divers## ity com## prising state## less nation## s , nation @## -## @ states and constitutional region## s , for the purpose of establish## ing a new European citizen## ship . 
- Mr President , the prim## ary du## ty of a parliament is to represent the people . 
our du## ty in relation to the Constitution## al Treat## y should be , first of all , to measure the gap between the people## s of Europe and this Treat## y : with## out the people there can be no Constitution . 
to the democratic de## ficit in the draft## ing of the Treat## y we can now add the lack of demo## cracy in it## s adopt## ion : if we can## not have a s## ing## le refer## endum for all of Europe &apos;## s citizen## s , we could at least have held a refer## endum on the same day in all the countries of the Union . 
in## stead , how## ever , every## thing is done hap## hazard## ly and people are just as divorce## d from the Treat## y today as the## y we## re yesterday . 
Europe is in danger of going the way of the title## s of a famous tri## logy by the great European intellectual Italo Cal## vin## o : from to to . 
there are no people and there is no constitutional spirit in the Treat## y ; it lack## s any idea of it## s place in the world and in time . 
that is all ver## y serious , at a worry## ing time when war and terrorism have come to pre## dominate in politic## s , when natural disaster## s like the one in South @## -## @ East Asia s## peak of the social in## justice and the in## toler## able p## over## ty of this world . 
in a global## ised world , Europe is in danger of dec## lining : there is a feel## ing of mal## a## ise in Europe link## ed to it## s internal cris## is of social cohes## ion , while inst## ability ha## s become the key social factor of our time## s . 
this Treat## y represent## s the abdic## ation of politic## s in the face of all that : a sil## ent Constitution . 
in it , peace is a vague aspi## ration , not a repudi## ation of war . 
in it , the right## s of people , women and men , workers and migrants , are a vari## able dependent on a balance## d budget and monetar## y st## ability . 
demo## cracy is an optional extra . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y does not provid## e for right## s , apart from th## ose of the market ; it does not propos## e reform## s ; it ha## s no futur## e ; but in## stead it keep## s Europe s## tuck in it## s present cris## is . 
it is not just in## adequate : it is the wrong direct## ion al## together . 
that is why the Con## federal Group of the European Unit## ed Left / Nord## ic Green Left is decla## ring it## self again## st this Treat## y and will be campaign## ing again## st it in every country . 
we need to free our## selves of this enc## umbr## ance in order to build the Europe of the futur## e . 
Mr President , today , the European Parliament is deba## ting a treat## y that is , as regard## s it## s nature and content , a constitut## ion , or at least that is what the rapporteur## s tell us we are do## ing . 
in the report , the## y take as the## ir start## ing point the ap## parent op## position between the Council and Member State## s on the one hand and Parliament and the citizen## s on the other . 
in do## ing s## o , the## y over## look the fact that the European institution## s owe the## ir exist## ence to the voluntary transfer of power## s by the Member State## s . 
more## over , citizen## s continu## e to ident## ify prim## arily with the## ir own state . 
a European ident## ity that ha## s be## en impose## d from above , with it## s own symbol## ism , will not change this in any way . 
the treat## y endow## s the European Union with the character## istic## s of a state . 
one un## fortunate illust## ration of this is the Fo## reign Affair## s Minister , a joint figure## head who ha## s to cover up the lack of joint policy , and it is equal## ly un## fortunate that this person him## self become## s an institution . 
the rapporteur## s have to recognis## e that the dual respons## ibility on the part of the Council and Commission creat## es con## fusion and s## ow## s the seed## s of potent## ial conflict## s of loyal## ty . 
I can## not describ## e this treat## y as any## thing other th## an an im## pet## uous leap in the dark . 
- Mr President , as a Lithuania## n I ought to be proud that my country &apos;## s parliament was the first to rat## ify the European Constitution . 
how## ever , the major## ity of Lithuania &apos;## s citizen## s have not seen , read or discuss## ed it . 
it was not even debate## d by Lithuania &apos;## s Parliament . 
on the other hand I am s## ure that for the most part this Constitution is in keeping with the interest## s of my nation and state . 
how## ever , I would like to take this opportun## ity to draw your attention to Part 1 Article 8 of the Constitution , which lay## s down that the word euro - the name of the common curr## ency of the European Union - must be us## ed in the same way in all European Union language## s . 
it go## es again## st the fundamental principle of the Constitution and that of the creation of the European Union it## self , that is , respect for national language## s and culture## s . 
accord## ing to this article , which is bas## ed on Council Regul## ation No 97## 4 / 98 of 19## 98 , there would be an unprecedented intervention in the gram## matic## al system## s shape## d over thousand## s of year## s and in semantic relation## s express## ed not in word order , not in word## s with one form , but in the de## cl## ens## ion of word## s , of the language## s of the seven new countries of the European Union , a## mong them the Lithuania## n language . 
the Regul## ation mention## ed , announce## d six year## s ago , be## fore the new countries we## re admitted to the European Union , does not allow the word euro to be decline## d . 
s## uch a ban contradict## s Article 3## 14 of the European Comm## un## ity Treat## y and Article 53 of the Treat## y on European Union on the tru## e equal## ity of the European Union &apos;## s official language## s , as well as European Comm## un## ity Treat## y Article 5 on subsid## isation and Article 15## 1 on the limit## s of cultural poli## cies . 
I ask## ed the Commission and the Council why these circum## stance## s have not be## en take## n in## to consider## ation and four month## s later Mr Almunia , the European Commission## er for Eco## nomic and Mon## et## ary Affair## s , re## plied that the non @## -## @ dec## lin## able word euro is us## ed in the Constitution be## cause this was laid down in the Council Regul## ation . 
back to square one , and dis## respect for national language## s remain## ed . 
if s## uch a ban remain## s in the Constitution , th## en in the Lithuania## n version and all legisl## ation we will have an abundance of not on## ly un## gram## matic## al but absurd statement## s . 
I hope that Parliament will take these argument## s in## to account . 
thank you for your attention . 
- Mr President , a Constitution is the found## ing act of a State , and it was an entire## ly conscious decision to cho## ose that term , just as it was to give the EU a flag , an ant## hem , a motto and even a national celeb## ration . 
de## spite your pathetic deni## al## s , the European Constitution is , there## fore , with## out doubt , the found## ing act of a European super## state . 
it represent## s the death of our often an## cient nation## s and the## ir transform## ation in## to a number of power## less province## s with## in this bureaucrat## ic , omni## potent and centralise## d State . 
I know that you bli## the## ly accus## e th## ose who do not share your blind belief in the benefit## s of the Europe of Bru## ssels of lies , of mediocr## ity and even of stupid## ity . 
this is a hand## y tactic and entail## s n## ever having to explain . 
it also make## s it possible to follow the per## empt## ory statement## s of the happy few , who know - or think the## y know - what is good for the , in the## ir view , un## cultivate## d , mass## es . 
the fear instil## led in you by the fact that refer## endum## s are to be held on the Constitution is an illust## ration of the contempt in which you hold the citizen## s . 
what , for that matter , are the benefit## s of which people s## peak ? 
I have seen with my own eye## s , as a direct con## sequenc## e of European poli## cies , the destruct## ion of our farm## ing and of our econom## ies , comp## any re## location## s and de## industrial## isation , end## emic un## employ## ment and p## over## ty , the dis## integration of our social protection system## s , the open## ing of our border## s to im## migration on a mass## ive scale , to terrorism and to international crime . 
the Europe of Bru## ssels is not , of course , s## ole## ly respons## ible - it could not have creat## ed or exacerb## ated these problem## s with## out the coll## us## ion of govern## ments , of all political hue## s , which have decide## d to sacrifice the## ir countries &quot; in## depend## ence and the## ir inhabit## ants &quot; free## dom to the Bru## ssels Lev## ia## th## an . 
the European Constitution will put the finish## ing touch## es to this mon## st## rous ed## ific## e , which was beg## un over 40 year## s ago . 
that might be what you want , but we are reject## ing it be## cause Europe and the European## s deserve better th## an this soul## less super## state . 
we are reject## ing it in the name of free## dom , in the name of in## depend## ence , in the name of the sovereign## ty which belong## s s## ole## ly to the people and which is in## alien## able , and in the name of th## ose people &apos;## s right to self @## -## @ de## termination . 
the Member## s of this House have betray## ed the## ir home## land## s . 
the## ir guilt is there for all to see . 
the## y will be curse## d by histo## ry and by futur## e generation## s . 
- Mr President , we would be making a serious mistake if we consider## ed the Union to be mer## e## ly an economic ent## ity or a vast free @## -## @ trade area , or even a kind of super## state re## plac## ing the national states . 
Europe is prim## arily a great ideal , and it was an ideal for the found## ing father## s Alcide De Gas## peri and Kon## rad Adenauer , from Robert Schu## man to Altiero S## pin## elli , from Gaetano Mart## ino to Hel## mut Kohl . 
Europe is our histo## ry : it is the synthesis of our culture## s and our language## s , our ident## ity and our futur## e . 
it is the Europe of value## s , of the central import## ance of the individual , of free## dom , solid## arity and subsid## i## arity . 
we can## not think of a Union shut in tight## ly with## in it## s border## s ; we can## not think of Europe as a machine - albeit an efficient one - run by a bureau## cracy that keep## s changing the rule## s . 
on the bas## is of the principle of subsid## i## arity it## self , Europe must in## stead solv## e the major problem## s of it## s citizen## s which other institution## s are un## able to address . 
does the Constitution interpret these value## s ? 
the answer is substanti## ally &apos; y## es , &quot; even though we can## not hide our pro## found regret that there is no reference to the Union &apos;## s Ju## d## aeo @## -## @ Christ## ian root## s . 
s## uch a reference would have represent## ed not a religious cho## ice , but the ident## ification of our un## deni## able historical root## s . 
the decision to sign the Constitution in Rome was , for our country , an import## ant acknowledg## e## ment of the work car## ried out d## uring the six month## s of I## ta## ly &apos;## s Presidency . 
to be effective , a fundamental law need## s to have life breath## ed in## to it ; in other word## s , it ha## s to be put in## to practice and invest## ed with political power . 
that is why Europe , through the Constitution , re## ally must s## peak with a s## ing## le voice in foreign policy . 
it must win a seat on the new UN Security Council and it must be an export## er of peace and not just of special interest## s in the Medi## terranean area and the Middle East . 
the world of global## isation need## s this Europe , the Europe of solid## arity , subsid## i## arity and human right## s - the political Europe of the people whom this Parliament tru## ly represent## s . 
thank you , Mr President . 
there can be no doubt that Europe , the Member State## s , and , above all , Europe &apos;## s citizen## s need a European Constitution . 
the present frame## work of the Treat## ies is too narrow for an enlarg## ing Europe . 
what was adequate for 15 Member State## s is no long## er adequate for 25 Member State## s . 
after all , one would not try to dress a fully @## -## @ grown 25 @## -## @ year @## -## @ old in the same suit he wor## e when he was 15 year## s old . 
he would need to be b## ought a new one . 
the same is tru## e for Europe , and the enlarge## d European Union must there## fore have a legal and organisation## al frame## work that correspond## s to it## s s## ize , intention## s and ambit## ions . 
the European Constitution creat## es s## uch a frame## work . 
the Constitution is a good document as it represent## s a compromis## e . 
it make## s the EU more citizen @## -## @ friend## ly , more efficient and better . 
it also make## s the Union a place where human be## ing## s are valu## ed and where demo## cracy and securit## y are safeguard## ed . 
more## over , it provid## es for a high level of protection of citizen## s &quot; personal right## s , and grant## s them better access to the affair## s of the entire EU and influence on the European Union &apos;## s legisl## ative capacities . 
the EU &apos;## s citizen## s are well aware of this , and this is why the## y support the European Constitution in s## uch large number## s , even if the## y are not entire## ly familiar with the detail## s of it## s content## s . 
this is the case in my country , Po## land . 
I am proud to be able to tell you that 73 % of Pol## es are in favour of the European Constitution , de## spite the reserv## ations pre## vi## ously express## ed by my govern## ment with regard to the draft Treat## y , and de## spite the campaign that ha## s be## en conduct## ed again## st the Constitution with## in the country . 
it ha## s become ap## parent that it is a mistake to exploit the Constitution in domestic political disput## es . 
no political party ha## s the right to call for the Constitution to be reject## ed , even if it is in op## position . 
refer## endum## s on the Constitution should relate to it## s content## s , and not turn in## to anti @## -## @ governmental plebiscit## es . 
the citizen## s of the European Union are aware of this , and this is why the## y know better th## an politic## ians what is good for them . 
the## y subscrib## e to the view that who## ever is in favour of Europe is in favour of the European Constitution . 
we should listen to them . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the European Constitution , or Constitution## al Treat## y , is a better legal bas## is th## an any we in the European Union have pre## vi## ously had , and , as it is a good and accept## able compromis## e , our group re## ally can vot## e to endorse it . 
we should regard the European Constitution## al Treat## y as be## ing , above all , a great chance to construct a share## d European ident## ity . 
that is what we in Europe need : a sense of be## ing &apos; us , &quot; a feel## ing of belong## ing together , with us all see## ing our## selves as European## s and also Germa## ns , West## ph## al## ians from the north of the Rhine , and , in my case , citizen## s of Co## log## ne - all this ma## de possible by this European Constitution## al Treat## y . 
we have written our share## d value## s in## to this Constitution## al Treat## y , there## by making this old continent in## to some## thing of a new world , for the wonder## ful thing about this Constitution## al Treat## y is that we are defi## ning in precise term## s what hold## s us together . 
if this feel## ing of be## ing &apos; us , &quot; this ident## ity , is to come in## to be## ing , it is quit## e vital that all European## s should be able to decide for them## selves whet## her the## y want this Constitution . 
that is why we are campaign## ing for refer## endum## s on it in every European country , for al## though most of the people can now vot## e on the Constitution## al Treat## y , not all European## s can . 
if the people of Europe are to know , first## ly , that this Constitution exist## s , and second## ly , having give## n it some thought , that the## y want it , it is vital that the## y them## selves should be ask## ed . 
we should there## fore let people them## selves vot## e and make an ef## fort to ensu## re that refer## endum## s are held in every country . 
it will not , un## fortunate## ly , be possible to organise it s## o that the## y are held all on the same day , but , if people them## selves are ask## ed , it will in any case enhance the## ir sense of ident## ity , the## ir aware## ness of be## ing &apos; us . &quot; 
lad## ies and gentle## men , I would invit## e you to see this Constitution## al Treat## y in perspective and not as the finish## ed article . 
the European idea ha## s n## ever be## en fix## ed , and it will not now be fix## ed in the word## ing of this new Treat## y . 
this Constitution is an import## ant , essential and in## dispens## able stag## ing post , but it is s## till on## ly a stag## ing post . 
Mr Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing s## aid of this document that it was un## hop## ed @## -## @ for . 
I prefer to say of it that , broad## ly s## peak## ing , it can s## till be improve## d , give## n the ex## tent to which , and de## spite the un## question## able advance## s it entail## s , the d## ro## s## s from the pre## vi## ous document## s s## till cl## ing## s to it . 
our fellow citizen## s are prepar## ed to live with this document as an inter## im report on the## ir common histo## ry but have no desir## e to be take## n host## age by it for deca## de## s , with all move## ment on what was the European compromis## e at the begin## ning of the twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury in## definite## ly postpone## d . 
that is the whole point of Amendment No 17 , which I have table## d on be## half of my group and which a great man## y of my fellow MEP## s have co @## -## @ sign## ed . 
through this ver## y clear and ver## y brief amend## ment , our Parliament , and I quote , &apos; &#91; a &#93; n## nounc## es it## s intention of us## ing the new right of initiative confer## red upon it by the Constitution to propos## e amend## ments to the latter . &quot; 
I would thank our two co @## -## @ rapporteur## s , Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , for having support## ed this amend## ment , as it is the medium through which our House indic## ate## s that , while remain## ing fore## ver the driv## ing force of European development , it is attentive to the social and democratic advance## s await## ed by our fellow citizen## s . 
if the document we## re to be set in stone , there would be a danger of the same thing happen## ing to the Constitution too . 
more## over , any stone out of which the Constitution## al Treat## y we## re to be carv## ed would not , what## ever Mr Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing may think , be that out of which the e## quest## rian statue commemor## ating the President of the Convent## ion would also be carv## ed . it might , ra## ther , be that mark## ing the grave of the European project . 
the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance would there## fore again invit## e you to embrac## e a progress## ive Europe , as the constitutional process is s## till in it## s ear## ly days , and it## s strength and interest lie specific## ally in it## s new## ness . 
I o## nce wrote a book on the emerge## nce of human right## s the## ory and on the American Constitution , s## o I have some understand## ing of the posit## ive aspect## s of this document . 
what I do not understand , how## ever , is why the European Parliament wish## es free## ly to condemn it## self to a second @## -## @ class position by support## ing this document . 
Article III @## -## @ 3## 30 ( 2 ) read## s as follow## s : &apos; a European law of the European Parliament s## hall lay down the regulation## s and general conditio## ns govern## ing the perform## ance of the du## ties of it## s Member## s . 
the European Parliament s## hall act on it## s own initiative after seek## ing an opinion from the Commission and after obtain## ing the consent of the Council . 
the Council s## hall act un## anim## ously on all rule## s or conditio## ns re## l## ating to the tax## ation of Member## s or former Member## s . &quot; 
this pre## serve## s the sup## rem## acy of the Commission , the executive , which ha## s more right## s th## an we do , and it also pre## serve## s the un## just dis## par## ities between us as legitimate represent## ative## s of the European people . 
on## ly we are tru## ly legitimate , with all the other European bodies be## ing deriv## ative , and s## o I believ## e that this provision must be omit## ted . 
al## though Mr## s Wall## s## tröm ha## s just s## aid that we would have more demo## cracy , I do not think that it is more demo## cracy we want , but mer## e## ly demo## cracy , pur## e and simpl## e . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , if you ga## ve the Constitution , or what## ever you ultimate## ly call it , to a carto## on## ist in any country of Europe who respect## s the principle## s of demo## cracy , of national sovereign## ty , of the value## s of the histo## ric and cultural heritage , he would draw it like a minc## er from which vari## ous part## s of vari## ous anim## al## s , from sheep to cow## s , come out in the form of minc## ed meat . 
but people are not anim## al## s and it is a crime to treat them like minc## ed meat . 
fascism di## d it with weapon## s and some people appear to en## vy it## s intention## s , and 65 year## s later certain other weapon## s s## uch as money and propag## anda are be## ing us## ed for the same reason . 
we there## fore say no to the can## ning of the people## s of Europe , no to the law of the jung## le which thrott## les the weak , no to the im## position of under## hand approach## es and people and no to ef## fort## s to turn citizen## s in## to doc## ile rob## ot## s in the hand## s of multi## national## s and bank## s . 
we say y## es to the right of opinion and re## jection , y## es to the Europe of sovereign nation## s , y## es to Christ## ian## ity and human right## s , y## es to the pride and dign## ity of the people## s . 
&apos;## i recognis## e you by the fierce edge of your s## word . 
I recognis## e you by the look which measure## s the earth with force . &quot; 
and force us## ed on the spirit is wor## s## e th## an force again## st the body . 
there is s## till time for resist## ance . 
we have time to re## verse global## isation and the new order of thing## s . &apos; . 
Mr President , since the first six countries join## ed force## s , the European Comm## un## ities have develop## ed a form of co## operation that is not perfect but that is non## e## the## less a form of co## operation between states of equal value who## s## e govern## ments have the last word concern## ing the states &quot; co## operative particip## ation . 
what is more , the adhere## nts of this Constitution have not today conceal## ed the fact that Europe is to be govern## ed not by the countries &quot; govern## ments but by a strong Commission who## s## e parliament## ary legal## ity lies in the direct## ly elect## ed European Parliament . 
my party and I disput## e the sense and valid## ity of this construct## ion . 
this Constitution re## move## s countries &quot; in## depend## ence in favour of a non @## -## @ trans## parent regime pursu## ing object## ive## s that , in all too man## y case## s , do not have grass @## -## @ root## s support . 
my country &apos;## s old## est constitutional document , the Jut## ish Law of 12## 41 , states , for ex## ample , and I quote : &apos; the law s## hall be honest and just , toler## able in term## s of the country &apos;## s custom## s , appropriate , use## ful and clear , s## o that every## one might know and understand what the law say## s . &quot; 
it may be s## aid of the Constitution that we are deba## ting in this House today that it is not honest about the intention## s be## hind it . 
if it is just , it is on## ly s## o in the eye## s of th## ose who wish to amass power through## out the whole of Europe . 
it is not toler## able for the major## ity of European## s , for it on## ly correspond## s to the custom## s of a few countries . 
it is of no use in term## s of free co## operation , and it is not clear , for no one can know and understand what the Constitution say## s . 
this draft Constitution must be reject## ed . 
other## wise , the EU will end up as a regime of the big power## s , which will damage the EU as a whole . 
I re## commend the minor## ity &apos;## s amend## ment . 
Europe deserve## s better . 
pleas## e allow me , lad## ies and gentle## men , to use my time to explain the actual supplement## ary propos## al , to digress a li## ttle from the spirit of the pre## vi## ous discuss## ion . 
the propos## al I refer to , P## roposal No 10 , correct## s one of the dis## crep## ancies introduce## d by the Constitution , th## ose dis## crep## ancies about which s## o much ha## s be## en s## aid today . 
in fact , the text of the agri## cultural policy is out of d## ate in the Constitution , fif## ty year## s out of d## ate . 
the legitimate aim of agri## cultural policy half a cent## ury ago was to produce sufficient food . 
today the situ## ation is revers## ed , Europe ha## s the problem of dispos## ing of it## s surplus## es . 
the European Parliament &apos;## s AG## RI committee ha## s even point## ed , in it## s view## s on the Constitution , to the direct conflict between the origin## al aim## s of the common agri## cultural policy and the Constitution . 
on the other hand , increas## ed competitive## ness is a priorit## y aim of all the reform## s which have be## en and are be## ing ma## de in the common agri## cultural policy - but this is not include## d in the Constitution . 
the draft amend## ment right## s this wrong . 
it would also be desir## able for the European Parliament to adopt this draft amend## ment be## cause , in the entire re## solution of the European Parliament , this is actual## ly the on## ly reference to the most import## ant common policy - the agri## cultural policy . 
the subject of our debate , the Constitution , may be the first joint creation of the reunite## d Europe . 
the Member State## s may also regard it as the## ir own , as we , including my## self , particip## ated in the work of the Convent## ion draft## ing the Constitution for a year and a half . 
it is , per## hap## s , not by accident that two new Member State## s , Lithuania and Hung## ary we## re the first to rat## ify the Constitution . 
the Hung## arian parliament even propos## ed an amend## ment including minor## ity right## s a## mong the fundamental principle## s of the Constitution . 
it is an import## ant basic principle , since Europe is also the Europe of minor## ities , and every## one is a minor## ity in Europe . 
at the same time , it is import## ant that minor## ity right## s are exerc## ised collect## ive## ly and mutual## ly and that the Constitution allow## s for this as well . 
this is , there## fore , ver## y pleas## ing to us . 
how## ever , I find it a li## ttle un## settling that there are man## y people here in the European Parliament and also a## mong the European public who we## re offend## ed by the acknowledg## e## ment of the historical fact that Christ## ian## ity contribut## ed to build## ing a joint Europe , to the creation of today &apos;## s Europe . 
it was by no mean## s an attempt to get rid of a secular Europe , but we found it necess## ary that in add## ition to mention## ing the inherit## ance of human## ism , enlighten## ment and other common European value## s , the preamble acknowledg## ed the contribut## ion of Christ## ian## ity to this joint Europe and it## s role in making it possible for us to be here today . 
I am , how## ever , pleas## ed that the Constitution allow## s for an institutional dia## logue between church## es and the European Union , which is a ver## y import## ant aspect for church## es . 
this hold## s tru## e , no matter how man## y dis## approve of this idea . 
as the leader of the Hung## arian Socialist delegation and as a p## resident of the Inter## group for historical national minor## ities , regional language## s and constitutional region## s , I welcome the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
this Constitution## al Treat## y is of histo## ric import## ance in man## y regard## s . 
it is definite## ly s## o for national minor## ities , as it will be the first time in the histo## ry of the Union that national minor## ity right## s become part of the . 
at last a work## ing system can final## ly be establish## ed to protect minor## ity right## s with## in the European Union . 
as a Hung## arian Socialist , I am e## special## ly proud that it was my govern## ment who initiate## d the section regard## ing minor## ity group## s . 
million## s of people belong## ing to national minor## ity group## s will celeb## rate the Constitution## al Treat## y &apos;## s coming in## to effect . 
I represent a country where 10 % of the population is ma## de up of minor## ities , and from a cultural point of view , one thir## d of it## s people live## s out## side it## s national border## s . 
as a represent## ative in the European Parliament , I had the right to say in the Hung## arian parliament &apos;## s rat## ification debate that every country , including Hung## ary , s## hall now have two Constitution## s . 
the more gener## ous Constitution is to be observ## ed . 
we must ensu## re that we al## ways refer to the Constitution that grant## s more right## s to our citizen## s , to the citizen## s of Europe . 
all countries will become rich## er in this respect . 
with regard to minor## ity right## s , the Hung## arian Constitution is far more gener## ous th## an the European Constitution## al Treat## y , as it include## s collect## ive right## s , acknowledg## es national minor## ities as decision @## -## @ making factor## s in legisl## ation , and in add## ition to equal treat## ment , it emphasis## es the import## ance of favour## able treat## ment , posit## ive discrimin## ation and allow## s minor## ities to establish the## ir own institution## s of self @## -## @ govern## ment at all level## s . 
Mr President , there is plen## ty of critic## ism that could be level## led at the Constitution## al Treat## y , and , al## though the text is certain## ly an improve## ment on what we have at present , the question remain## s as to whet## her it is good en## ough . 
in my view , there are a few mis## s## ed opportun## ities in a number of area## s . 
let us , for ex## ample , consider the elect## ion of the President of the European Commission . 
as I see it , the European public , or at least the European Parliament , should be ask## ed to vot## e . 
in## de## ed , that is what is stated in the new Constitution , but in the first in## stance there is on## ly one candid## ate , as oppose## d to vari## ous candid## ate## s , s## o there is no cho## ice . 
the same appli## es to co## decision : a wonder## ful European model , a broad major## ity of people## s and a political major## ity should app## ly a## cross the board . 
that may be what the Constitution stipul## ate## s , but ver## y li## ttle will be put in## to practice right now . 
it follow## s that there is room for much more efficiency and more demo## cracy . 
when it come## s to rat## ifying the Constitution , and certain## ly in countries where a refer## endum is to be held on it , the debate will not , though , be about subtle## ties and the differ## ence## s between the old and new situ## ation . 
that is a debate reserv## ed for con## nois## s## eur## s like us . 
the treat## y is about more th## an these innov## ations ; it is about the text as a whole . 
we will be vot## ing on a text which is an out## line of what we have built up over 50 year## s of Europe - fif## ty year## s of peace , securit## y , free move## ment of person## s , good## s , service## s and capital . 
if I consider the opportun## ities and challenge## s which the Dutch , a## long with all European## s , are able to take on in this large Union , th## en I have no doubt## s and vot## e in favour . 
a refer## endum will be held in the N## ether## land## s in a few month## s &quot; time . 
I am al## read## y oppose## d to the argument that , as a result of the new Constitution## al Treat## y , the imminent access## ion of Tur## key would mean that small Member State## s , s## uch as the N## ether## land## s , would more or less dis## appear in## to obliv## ion with## in the Union . 
this is rab## ble @## -## @ rous## ing , be## cause Tur## key is a separat## e decision and the public should , in my view , make up it## s own mind in a refer## endum when the time come## s . 
it is , how## ever , also a sign of small @## -## @ mind## ed think## ing . 
it is in the present institutional cha## os of Europe that large Member State## s can exert dis## proportion## ate amount## s of influence , and small## er Member State## s benefit from law and order . 
I am in favour of proper and democratic govern## ance and again## st cha## os . 
d## uring the forth## coming refer## endum , the Dutch Liberal## s will campaign active## ly in favour of the EU &apos;## s new Constitution## al Treat## y . 
Mr President , the wor## st sentenc## e in the Constitution , which is in conflict with the basic idea of the Co## al and St## eel Union , is &apos; Member State## s s## hall under## take progress## ive## ly to improve the## ir milit## ary cap## abilities . &quot; 
if the purpose had be## en on## ly to reduce the defence budget through great## er efficiency , that is what would have be## en stated . 
now , the clear aim is to increas## e the EU &apos;## s milit## ary s## tri## king power . 
from dis## armament , we are now mov## ing to## ward## s re## armament . 
if we combin## e this with the word## ing to the effect that &apos; &#91; I &#93; n it## s relation## s with the wide## r world , the Union s## hall uphold and promot## e it## s value## s and interest## s , &quot; we see a return to a 500 year @## -## @ old colonial policy . 
this may cause anxie## ty in the wide## r world , which re## member## s the last time we want## ed to spread our civil## isation with the help of the arm## y . 
it might per## hap## s creat## e peace between our## selves , but in the world it will creat## e anxie## ty . 
this is not a document for the futur## e . 
it is a return to old @## -## @ style imperial## ism and colonial## ism . 
it is some## thing I reject . 
Mr President , I am in favour of reject## ing the Constitution , as is all my group . 
at the same time I would like to remind every## one that the European Parliament does not have compete## nce in this matter . 
this debate and the committee initiative report to be adopt## ed , which is bas## ed on it , have no legal bas## is or value . 
one reason why the Constitution should be reject## ed is that it mean## s the militari## s## ation of the European Union . 
under the Constitution , Member State## s even have to agree to increas## e the## ir milit## ary expend## iture . 
it is quit## e in## cred## ible that there should be a provision on s## uch a subject at the level of the EU Constitution . 
govern## ments of the Member State## s are be## having as if the Constitution we## re al## read## y in force . 
it ha## s be## en decide## d to establish 13 battle group## s , and to equip them as if the## y we## re shock troop## s . 
in fact the## y are shock troop## s , as the intention is to use them for illegal milit## ary operation## s just be## cause the EU decide## s to . 
we in the Convent## ion di## d not adopt a ruling for the Constitution stating that operation## s out## side the EU &apos;## s border## s must al## ways be lawful - in other word## s , that the## y must al## ways have a mandate from the Unit## ed Nation## s . 
the Constitution should be reject## ed , but let the people do it . 
in fact , the people of just one nation will suffice . 
Mr President , this is the first time delegate## s have be## en present here who bring with them 50 year## s &quot; experience of life under total## itarian## ism . 
today , al## though we are deal## ing with the draft European Constitution , I occasion## ally feel as if I am back in the old time## s . 
an un## elect## ed get @## -## @ together known as the Convent## ion ha## s produce## d a rush## ed document . 
in a similar way , a power## ful elit## e o## nce ma## de decision## s in our country and th## en issu## ed it## s re## solution## s as pre## desti## ned inevit## abilities . 
we are today be## ing told that re## jection of the Constitution would cause a catastrophe of cosm## ic proportion## s . 
life ha## s ultimate## ly show## n that no catastrophe## s have occur## red , and the same is tru## e now . 
a hybrid structure mix## ing constitutional principle## s with practical poli## cies ha## s be## en develop## ed , open## ing up bound## less s## cope for interpret## ation by uncontroll## able EU official## s . 
there is a parallel here , as well , as we too have had document## s pass## ing decision## s from our country to other## s with## out author## isation . 
we are s## itt## ing here today in a Chamber adorn## ed with lavish ban## ner## s on the Constitution . 
on s## uch occasion## s , we too us## ed to put up ban## ner## s and listen to nois## y bra## s## s band## s , s## o that the es## s## ence of the document which had be## en approve## d was eclips## ed by the euphoria . 
we do not need a European Constitution , and what we certain## ly do not need is this fuzzy document we are about to vot## e on . 
what we also do not need is to expend EU resource## s on spectacular celeb## rations . 
we should do better to s## end the money to S## ri Lanka . 
- Mr President , I s## peak on be## half of the new Italia## n Socialist Part## y . 
we feel that we must warm## ly welcome the new European Constitution . 
the Member State## s are transfer## ring a grow## ing proportion of the## ir sovereign## ty to benefit an ambitious global idea , where## by 25 countries tread a common path together , side by side . 
it is 21 year## s since this Chamber , by a large major## ity , adopt## ed the plan to reform the European Union that had be## en drawn up by the Italia## n Member Altiero S## pin## elli . 
it was a complex and dar## ing plan , which was clear## ly design## ed to creat## e a more integrate## d Comm## un## ity . 
since th## en , li## ttle by li## ttle , the nation## s of the old continent have continu## ed to add to and to develop the reason## s for unit## ing with## in this international frame## work , which ha## s under## gone remark## able mod## ification## s and change## s . 
the Constitution , sign## ed on 29 October in Rome , just as in 19## 57 , is a fundamental achiev## e## ment in that con## text . 
half a cent## ury later , Europe &apos;## s road ha## s come back to the place where it all beg## an : an ex## citing new challenge involv## ing us all in creat## ing and build## ing the Europe of tomor## row . 
Mr President , as V## ice @## -## @ Chair## man of the Convent## ion , I can on## ly rejoic## e at the like## lihood of the European Parliament , tomor## row , and by an overwhelm## ing major## ity , decla## ring it## self in favour of this Constitution . 
al## though the European Parliament need not give it## s opinion formal## ly for some time , this position on the bas## is of the excel## lent report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , in my view , s## end## s a strong mess## age to Europe . 
it is tru## e that we , in the Convent## ion , tri## ed to provid## e an answer to the challenge## s that Europe is fac## ing , name## ly enlarge## ment and global## isation , and this Constitution would not have assume## d it## s present dimension## s with## out the European Parliament &apos;## s import## ant contribut## ion . 
I think that this Constitution , al## though it is a compromis## e , ha## s , in term## s of qual## ity , be## en a consider## able step forward . 
the Constitution provid## es the institutional frame## work that the enlarge## d Europe require## s . 
in## de## ed , it is im## possible for Europe to continu## e to work with the same institution## s and the same rule## s as it di## d when there we## re fifteen Member State## s . 
at the same time , I think that the tru## e dimension of this Constitution is that we , al## though the first step was take## n at Maas## tri## cht , are on## ly now re## ally changing from an economic communit## y to a political union : the end of the pillar## s , the communit## isation of the thir## d pillar as regard## s the area of free## dom and justice and a far more develop## ed external policy , en## ab## ling Europe to s## peak with one voice in this global## ised world . 
al## though I hope that a large major## ity will support this Constitution tomor## row , let us not forget that we in this House carry a major respons## ibility in convincing the Member State## s that Europe need## s it . 
I declare the session adjourn## ed until 3 p.m . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , be## fore the two vot## es which will take place today at n## oon , I should like to give the floor for one minute to Mr McMillan @## -## @ Scott , Chair## man of the Deleg## ation for Observ## ation of the Palestinian President## ial Elect## ions and V## ice @## -## @ President of the Parliament . 
. Mr President , we have all return## ed safe## ly from Palestine . 
I wish to thank my colleague## s - there we## re 28 of us , the large## st ever delegation of the European Parliament - the vice @## -## @ chair## man , Mr## s Nap## oletano , and the staff who accompani## ed us and prepar## ed the observ## ation mission . 
our task , as Member## s of the European Parliament , is to deliver an inform## ed political verdict on this cruc## ial elect## ion at the Bru## ssels part @## -## @ session later this month . 
how## ever , we feel that the Palestinian people - e## special## ly the women - should be proud . 
in spite of the Israel## i occupation and the lack of opportun## ity for East Jerusalem resident## s and other## s to vot## e , this elect## ion prepar## es the ground for the Palestinian parliament## ary elect## ions in Ju## ly and could serve as a model for other## s in the region . 
I hope that the European Parliament will respond to the appet## ite for demo## cracy in the Arab world as a whole . 
we s## hall now proceed to the vot## e . 
re## commend## ation ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 01 / 20## 05 ) by Ja## mes N## icholson , on be## half of the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment , on the propos## al for a Council regulation amend## ing Regul## ation ( EC ) No 12## 60 / 19## 99 lay## ing down general provision## s on the Struct## ural Fund## s concern## ing the extens## ion of the dur## ation of the P## EA## CE programme and the grant## ing of new commit## ment appropri## ations ( 16## 06## 4 / 20## 04 - COM ( 20## 04 ) 06## 31 - C## 6 @## -## @ 02## 52 / 20## 04 - 20## 04 / 02## 24 ( A## VC ) ) 
. Mr President , I am grat## e## ful for the opportun## ity to address colleague## s be## fore , hope## fully , my report is vot## ed through plen## ary . 
the P## EA## CE programme is of much more th## an pur## e## ly financial import## ance to North## ern Ireland and the border count## ies of the Republic of Ireland . 
it is the most visible contribut## ion s## o far by the European Union to build## ing a s## table soci## ety in North## ern Ireland and , to that ex## tent , it ha## s enormous symbol## ic value as well . 
it is a fine ex## ample of the European Union offer## ing assist## ance with## out inter## fer## ing in the local political process . 
on be## half of the people of North## ern Ireland , I thank th## ose who have work## ed s## o hard to ensu## re that this report was able to go through it## s parliament## ary stag## es at speed . 
I am grat## e## ful to the chair## man and the secretariat of the Committee on Region## al Develop## ment for address## ing the propos## al as a priorit## y o## nce it was receiv## ed from the Commission . 
I am also ver## y grat## e## ful to the Committee on Budget## s for it## s efficient hand## ling of the budget## ary question , which ha## s en## able## d us to vot## e today . 
whi## lst I am also grat## e## ful to the Council and the Commission , I regret that the Brit## ish and Irish govern## ments di## d not ask for a high## er s## um of money . 
the amount allocate## d fall## s some## what short of initial expect## ations . 
how## ever , I am pleas## ed that the P## EA## CE programme is be## ing extend## ed and would be grat## e## ful for strong support for this symbol of EU commit## ment to all the people of North## ern Ireland . 
the next item is the elect## ion of the European Ombuds## man . 
the elect## ion will be held in accord## ance with Rule 19## 4 ( 5 ) of the Rule## s of Procedure . 
I have receiv## ed the follow## ing nomi## nation## s : 
- Mr Nikiforos Diam## and## our## os 
- Mr Giuseppe Fort## un## ato 
two other nomi## nation## s have be## en declare## d in## admiss## ible . 
( a secret ballot was held ) 
the out## come of the vot## e on the elect## ion of the European Ombuds## man is as follow## s : 
Member## s vot## ing : 64## 3 
blank or void ballot paper## s : 34 
vot## es cast : 6## 09 
major## ity require## d : 3## 05 
the result## s we## re as follow## s : 
Nikiforos D## IA## M## A## ND## O## UR## OS 56## 4 vot## es 
Giuseppe FOR## T## UN## AT## O 45 vot## es 
the major## ity of vot## es cast we## re for Mr Diam## and## our## os , who is there## fore elect## ed European Ombuds## man . 
I would like to congratul## ate him on hi## s elect## ion , and to call upon him to take an o## ath im## mediate## ly be## fore the Court of Just## ice , in accord## ance with Rule 19## 4 ( 7 ) of the Rule## s of Procedure . 
. congratul## ations , Mr Diam## and## our## os . 
we hope that you will pursu## e active## ly , as you di## d d## uring your pre## vi## ous mandate , your activities under Article 19## 5 of the EC Treat## y . 
we know what a vital role the Ombuds## man play## s , en## h## ancing the respons## ibility of the Comm## un## ity administ## ration , as well as stimul## ating think## ing on practice## s and procedure## s . 
I promise that the Commission will continu## e to work active## ly and close## ly with you . 
the Commission is also aware of the fact that citizen## s are making increas## ing use of the## ir right to complain to the European Ombuds## man . 
the number of complain## ts rose substanti## ally d## uring the first ten month## s of last year , compar## ed to the same period in 20## 03 . 
this seem## s to mean that the rise in the number of complain## ts reflect## s the fact that citizen## s know about the## ir right## s , ra## ther th## an any worsen## ing in the administ## rative behaviour of European institution## s - at least , that is what we hope . 
the Commission is look## ing forward to im## prov## ing it## s co## operation with the European Ombuds## man . 
we wish you all the best in your import## ant work . 
that conclude## s the vot## e . 
re## commend## ation : N## icholson ( A## 6 @## -## @ 00## 01 / 20## 05 ) 
. 
today I vot## ed in favour of the extens## ion of P## EA## CE Fund## ing but I di## d s## o with consider## able reserv## ation . 
that reserv## ation arise## s from the fact that , to d## ate , P## EA## CE Fund## ing in North## ern Ireland ha## s be## en allocate## d in a most im## balance## d way , to the gross dis## advantage to the Protestant / Union## ist Comm## un## ity . 
it ha## s also favour## ed terrorist prison## er group## s over victim group## s , who exist as victim## s be## cause of the horr## or visit## ed upon them by th## ose terrorist## s . 
d## uring this extens## ion of P## EA## CE Fund## ing I am look## ing for an over## t right## ing of these wrong## s . 
this fund## ing must be allocate## d in an even @## -## @ hand## ed mann## er . 
. 
I am de## light## ed to support this report and welcome the propos## ed extens## ion of the P## EA## CE programme to cover this year and 20## 06 . 
this decision will allow the P## EA## CE measure## s , design## ed to support re## conciliation , to be car## ried on for an## other few year## s . 
the continu## ation of these peace initiative## s is in## valu## able in re## build## ing trust between communit## ies and bring## ing communit## ies together from bo## th side## s of the border . 
peace focus## es specific## ally on re## conciliation and the project## s it ha## s fund## ed have contribut## ed great## ly to promot## ing mutual understand## ing and better communit## y relation## s . 
I am de## light## ed that fund## ing ha## s now be## en extend## ed to the end of 20## 06 and sincere## ly hope that further provision will be ma## de in the Fina## ncial Perspective## s when the## y are final## ly establish## ed and come in## to effect in 20## 07 . 
there is no doubt that our hope## s for a peace## ful futur## e depend on the good work of the vari## ous cross @## -## @ border and North @## -## @ South initiative## s fund## ed under this programme . 
the P## EA## CE programme is just## ified as an internal matter for the EU . 
the play## ers that have the main and ultimate respons## ibility for achiev## ing a con## solid## ation of the peace process are , how## ever , Ireland and Great Brit## ain . 
as the Ju## ne List s## ees it , it is of cruc## ial import## ance that economic aid not be us## ed as a form of &apos; structural aid , &quot; but that it be us## ed for bring## ing about real and practical improve## ments that promot## e posit## ive development of the peace process in North## ern Ireland . 
if it we## re on## ly up to the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance , the draft Constitution would be much more ambitious th## an the one present## ed to us . 
it would en## able us to give sub## stance to the political , social and eco## logical Europe that we champion . 
it would be a project with un## ambigu## ous and definite object## ive## s and not include this thir## d part that , in mer## e## ly echo## ing the ear## lier treat## ies , is an obstacle to an ambitious global project for Europe . 
in spite of it## s im## perfect## ions , I s## hall how## ever vot## e , and call upon other## s to vot## e , in favour of this Constitution## al Treat## y , for it would be an aberr## ation and a major political error to throw in one &apos;## s lot with th## ose oppose## d to the Constitution , on the pre## text that the final word## ing is not comm## ensu## rate with what is at s## take . 
we need Europe , even an im## perfect Europe , more th## an ever . 
with a Constitution , we s## hall succeed in launch## ing this peace @## -## @ orient## ed Europe , the bear## er of common value## s s## uch as human right## s and demo## cracy . 
it is by taking this major step that European## s will feel unit## ed in a genuine common project . 
it is a milit## ant &apos; y## es &quot; that I s## hall stand up for in vot## ing on the Corbett report . 
not to rise to this histo## ric occasion would be to den## y our own work as build## ers of Europe and would , for some consider## able time , inhibit what we wish to see , name## ly the ambitious development of European integration .## .. 
. 
I congratul## ate Mr N## icholson on hi## s excel## lent work on the re## commend## ation concern## ing the extens## ion of the dur## ation of the P## EA## CE programme . 
the P## EA## CE programme , which was start## ed in 19## 95 , is aim## ed at foster## ing peace and re## conciliation in North## ern Ireland and in border area## s of the Republic of Ireland . 
follow## ing the success of the P## EA## CE I programme , the Berlin European Council of 19## 99 decide## d to extend the programme for a further f## ive year## s , in order to provid## e continu## ity to the project## s that had be## en set up . 
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;## s position that in this region of Europe , which ha## s endur## ed over 30 year## s of viol## ence , all energ## ies should be channel## led in## to making it possible to maintain social inclus## ion , economic development and employ## ment , urban and r## ural re## generation and cross @## -## @ border co## operation . 
it is there## fore essential to extend the implement## ation of the P## EA## CE programme by two year## s , until the end of 20## 06 , coin## cid## ing with the program## ming period for the Struct## ural Fund## s and with a propos## al to extend the annual Comm## un## ity contribut## ion to the Inter## national Fund for Ireland for the same period . 
the wide## r aim , there## fore , is to align the measure## s financ## ed by these two instrument## s with intervention## s car## ried out in the region under EU cohes## ion policy . 
. 
I welcome this report , which formal## ly give## s the back## ing of the European Parliament to continu## ed EU fund## ing for the European Peace Fund until the year 20## 06 . 
in 20## 05 and 20## 06 , EUR 1## 08 million are be## ing allocate## d to this fund which is support## ing project## s in the border count## y region and North## ern Ireland . 
one thir## d of this fund , EUR 36 million , will be spent in the border count## y region , the remain## ing EUR 72 million be## ing spent in North## ern Ireland . 
the European Peace Fund 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 04 support## ed 4 000 project## s in North## ern Ireland and the border count## y region al## one . 
the European Union also give## s EUR 15 million a year to## ward## s the Inter## national Fund for Ireland and ha## s support## ed consecutive Inter## re## g programme## s d## ating back to the late 19## 80## s . 
in the over## all con## text of the peace process in Ireland , the European Union ha## s be## en at the fore## front in provid## ing political and financial support - and it is clear that it will continu## e to play an active and central role in this regard . 
. 
I vot## ed in favour of Mr N## icholson &apos;## s report on the P## EA## CE programme for North## ern Ireland , be## cause I feel that it is extreme## ly import## ant for the EU to show solid## arity with the Irish peace process . 
our solid## arity should be channel## led in## to benefit## ing the wide range of sector## s , group## s and communit## ies wor## st affect## ed by the viol## ence , and in## to foster## ing inter @## -## @ communit## y project## s . 
financial manage## ment through local## ly @## -## @ bas## ed partner## ship structure## s and sector## ally special## ised non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s will help to strength## en the ties of peace and re## conciliation that are cruc## ial to stabilis## ation in North## ern Ireland . 
I also consider essential the object## ive of financial consist## ency that ha## s be## en set out as a result of the extens## ion of the implement## ation of the P## EA## CE programme for a further two year## s , give## n that it constitut## es a step to## ward## s align## ing the action## s financ## ed by this instrument and by the Inter## national Fund for Ireland with intervention## s car## ried out in the region under the EU cohes## ion policy . 
. 
in a Europe that ha## s prov## ed cap## able of build## ing peace with## in it## s border## s , phenomena s## uch as th## ose in North## ern Ireland and the Bas## que Count## ry have , fortunate## ly , become few## er and far## ther between . 
give## n the serious nature of these situ## ations , how## ever , the EU must continu## e to condemn vehement## ly and un## conditional## ly the use of viol## ence as a mean## s of solv## ing political issue## s . 
in the con## text of the cease## fire initiative## s and the open## ing of negoti## ations between the two side## s in the North## ern Ireland conflict , I feel that similar de## termination must be show## n as regard## s any initiative## s intend## ed to help establish last## ing peace in th## ose ter## rit## ories . 
again## st this back## drop , I welcome the fact that financial support is to be maintain## ed for North## ern Ireland and for border area## s of the Republic of Ireland , and that the P## EA## CE II programme is to be extend## ed for a further two year## s . 
we are there## fore continu## ing with the debate on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go on the Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe . 
- Mr President , Mr V## ice @## -## @ President of the Commission , the new Treat## y is a posit## ive step from an institutional point of view , as every## one ha## s point## ed out . 
the new Treat## y give## s us a Union that is strong## er , more democratic and close## r to the citizen## s . 
it is also a Constitution which , most import## ant## ly , represent## s share## d value## s and is a political project . 
we see this straight## away with the constitutional## isation of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , which is aim## ed at creat## ing a soci## ety that s## ees it## self as a social market econom## y and that target## s full employ## ment . 
these are not mer## e word## s ; the## y are the EU &apos;## s new object## ive## s , which are enshrine## d in Article 3 of Part 1 of the Treat## y and which must guide all of it## s action## s and poli## cies . 
Article 18## 5 of Part III on monetar## y policy , for ex## ample , express## ly states that , with## out prejudice to the object## ive of price st## ability , the European System of C## ent## ral Bank## s support## s the general economic poli## cies in the Union in order to contribut## e to the achiev## e## ment of it## s object## ive## s as laid down in Article I @## -## @ 3 . 
horizontal application clause## s should also be high## light## ed . 
these clause## s guide the Union &apos;## s action## s and poli## cies laid down in Part III of the Treat## y . 
accord## ing## ly , Article## s 1## 15 to 1## 22 of Part III , for ex## ample , state that the vari## ous poli## cies of the EU must ensu## re that equal## ity between men and women is promot## ed , that the environment is protect## ed , that consum## ers are protect## ed , that social right## s s## uch as employ## ment are guarantee## d and that public service## s or service## s of general economic interest have the necess## ary conditio## ns to ful## fil the## ir mission## s . 
these ex## ample## s show how the new Treat## y strength## ens the European social model . 
it does not back## track on any gain## s that have be## en ma## de and enshrine## s new and import## ant advance## s . 
it is there## fore good news , in that it give## s tang## ible form to our desir## e to live in a soci## ety with high level## s of social protection and high environment## al value## s . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , f## ive year## s ago , there we## re some of us in this House who wish## ed to rev## ive S## pin## elli &apos;## s C## ro## cod## ile Club . 
at that time , we start## ed a federalist cross @## -## @ party group design## ed to work to## ward## s a European Constitution . 
there we## re man## y who laugh## ed in a ra## ther indulg## ent way th## en . 
in my home country of Swede## n , I was pat## ted on the head when I talk## ed about the need for a common document that clear## ly stated what we stand for , why we stand for th## ose thing## s and how we work . 
now , no one is laugh## ing any more , and talk## ing about a European Constitution is not e## special## ly controversial . 
most people are in favour of it . 
through the Convent## ion and through hard work , e## special## ly here in the European Parliament , we now have a draft European Constitution . 
that is fantas## tic progress . 
it make## s the EU strong## er , more open and more democratic , put## s the citizen centre s## tage and simpl## ifies decision @## -## @ making . 
Mr Corbett &apos;## s and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go &apos;## s re## solution give## s a ver## y sound and instruct## ive account of the advantage## s of the new Constitution and is a document that can in actual fact be us## ed in the campaign , since it is written in s## uch an educational way . 
certain## ly , a lot could have be## en better , and man## y fellow MEP## s have talk## ed about the fact in this House . 
personal## ly , I should have like## d to have seen a clear## er demarc## ation of the EU &apos;## s power## s . 
with s## o man## y Member State## s , it would have be## en sens## ible to concentr## ate upon ra## ther few## er issue## s at EU level s## o as to be more effective in these area## s . 
I should also have like## d to have seen the per## man## ent President plac## ed not in the Council but in the Commission . 
final## ly , I regret that the Convent## ion di## d not discuss the issue of the European Parliament &apos;## s seat . 
we must stop this commut## ing between Strasbourg and Bru## ssels . 
it is expensive and in## efficient and , as long as it go## es on , people will n## ever fully trust this institution . 
a new er## a is on the way . 
we s## hall be able to adopt new reform## s and s## hall be able in the futur## e to take further step## s with a view to the next Convent## ion and the next Constitution . 
first## ly , the present Constitution must be ratifi## ed and , over## all , this is a ver## y good draft . 
it constitut## es progress for European demo## cracy and for our citizen## s . 
opponent## s must bear in mind that the alter## native is the Treat## y of N## ice , which does not in any way increas## e demo## cracy with## in the EU . 
nor does the Treat## y of N## ice make it any easi## er for us to co## operate with s## o man## y Member State## s . 
I am there## fore look## ing forward with great enthusiasm to the debate that is now in the off## ing and that is al## read## y going on in the vari## ous Member State## s and to be## ing out with you on the street## s and in market## place## s defend## ing the European Constitution . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , together with the Flem## ish Green## s , I will , over the next few month## s , be conduct## ing a campaign for Belgian rat## ification of the Constitution in the federal , Flem## ish and Bru## ssels parliament## s . 
tomor## row , how## ever , we are not vot## ing on the Constitution , but on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , which I regard as disappoint## ing . 
it is an apolog## y , an excess## ive## ly one @## -## @ sided enume## ration of the Constitution &apos;## s man## y benefit## s . 
what a mis## s## ed opportun## ity , Mr Corbett ! 
should we not have give## n more consider## ation to the critic## ism that is now be## ing level## led by the Left ? 
why , for ex## ample , is it not possible to state that we are s## till on our way to## ward## s a fully @## -## @ fledg## ed European demo## cracy , that the role of the constitutional region## s is snow## ed under , that too man## y area## s of policy are s## till left for inter## governmental co## operation , that there are too man## y area## s in which the veto s## till appli## es ? 
why can it not be s## aid that the European Union is s## till too much in need of a social order , and that it## s orient## ation is too neoliberal ? 
that is why I would ask you to re## visit the amend## ments table## d by the Group of the Green## s / European Free Alli## ance , particular## ly Amendment## s No## s 4 , 9 , 15 and 16 and , I hope , support them when we vot## e tomor## row . 
- Mr President , a## mong the vari## ous reason## s for our op## position to this new Treat## y I should like to high## light the fact that it reinforce## s central## ism , federal## ism and European bureau## cracy , that it call## s for poli## cies appli## cable to all Member State## s of the Union , ir## respect## ive of the## ir actual situ## ations , and that it embed## s neoliberal## ism and the militari## s## ation of Europe more deep## ly . 
the blind im## position## s of the St## ability and G## row## th Pact , the European C## ent## ral Bank and the monetar## y and s## ing## le curr## ency poli## cies in the euro zone , regard## less of the re## ality of e## ach individual country , have led to a deterior## ation in the social situ## ation , to an increas## e in in## equal## ities ar## ising from the privat## isation of strategic sector## s and public service## s and to appal## ling attack## s on workers &quot; right## s . 
we have also seen how these practice## s in agri## culture , fisher## ies and in external trade policy have led to economic re## cession## s , to un## employ## ment and to the collapse of production in increas## ing## ly large sector## s in countries with weak## er econom## ies . 
by the same token , we can## not accept the promot## ion campaign for the new Treat## y , which is scarce## ly democratic and certain## ly not plural## ist , bas## ed as it is on the argument## s of it## s support## ers , dis## regard## ing the argument## s of th## ose who are oppose## d to it , th## ose fight## ing for a more social , more democratic Europe found## ed on the principle of sovereign State## s with equal right## s and commit## ted to peace . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , a Constitution should lay down the ground rule## s for policy and the right## s due to citizen## s of a demo## cracy . 
a Constitution should not establish the content of policy . 
social policy and policy re## l## ating to tax## es , energ## y , pol## ic## ing and issue## s concern## ed with alcohol should be drawn up by the people of e## ach country , acting together through the democratic process . 
when the will of the people change## s in a country , it must be possible for policy to be change## d . 
the draft with which we are now confront## ed is some## thing quit## e different . 
it is an express## ion of the political class &apos;## s own ambit## ions for the European project . 
it regulate## s in detail ; it deal## s with tour## ism and agri## culture ; it legitim## ises a corporate soci## ety ; it force## s e## ach Member State in## to a curr## ency union ; and it point## s to## ward## s a concentr## ation of power and a Europe govern## ed by technocrat## s . 
what is present## ed here as a Constitution is an attempt by the political establish## ment to usurp the European people## s &quot; democratic right to shape the## ir own futur## es . 
that is why the Ju## ne List reject## s this draft . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the task of European integration ha## s br## ought about the world &apos;## s large## st area of law and economic free## dom , but the organisation of our continent can## not stop there . 
Europe must become a political play## er , a political unit endow## ed with democratic power and diploma## tic cl## out . 
we want a Europe of states and people## s and , con## sequent## ly , we wish to strength## en people &apos;## s con## fidence in the European Union . 
that is in## de## ed what is propos## ed by the Constitution sign## ed in Rome . 
I again congratul## ate our rapporteur## s , Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , and would emphasis## e the progress ma## de through the new Treat## y . 
the rapporteur## s are s## end## ing out a clear mess## age to our fellow citizen## s : the Constitution is fine , with the best possible word## ing . 
it propos## es a more integrate## d , more efficient and more political Europe which is more attentive to people and strong## er bo## th internal## ly and external## ly . 
the Constitution , as s## uch , does not increas## e the compete## nce## s of the EU . 
it prevent## s the emerge## nce of a centralise## d super## state , it sanction## s the legal personal## ity of the EU and it give## s the EU a human face in the form of a long @## -## @ term President and a Fo## reign Minister . 
it also guarantee## s all our fellow citizen## s protection under the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
the European Parliament is gain## ing ground on the European political s## tage . 
final## ly , the Constitution facilit## ate## s re## course to enhance## d co## operation , making it possible to face up to what will be at s## take in the futur## e . 
the desti## ny of a European country is now insepar## able from the affirm## ation of it## s European personal## ity . 
the Constitution represent## s the best way for our Member State## s to confront the futur## e , start## ing from now . 
for them to be unit## ed a## round a document that the## y have all approve## d is ver## y ambitious . 
what now will turn this ambit## ion in## to a re## ality is the will of politic## ians and , in the first place , of our## selves . 
Mr President , the Dutch delegation with## in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believ## es that the debate is about the Constitution ra## ther th## an about whet## her we are in favour of Europe or again## st it . 
we are in favour , with reserv## ations , be## cause what matter## s to us are the benefit## s of the new Constitution compar## ed to the Treat## y of N## ice . 
the Europe of N## ice is un## decide## d as to how significant it is . 
the new Treat## y , how## ever , guarantee## s the influence of regional , de## centralise## d author## ities , and design## ate## s the national parliament as a watch## dog , s## o that Europe , ra## ther th## an threaten## ing to turn in## to a super## state , provid## es effective and cross @## -## @ border co## operation in respect of crime and food safety . 
in add## ition , in the new Constitution , more th## an 30 type## s of decision## s have be## en replace## d by a hand## ful of term## s read## ily recognis## able by the public , including &apos; law &quot; and &apos; en## ab## ling legisl## ation . &quot; 
with this , the Constitution introduce## s more clar## ity about the type of Europe we would like and decision @## -## @ making that we use to that end . 
the Constitution also bring## s us more effective## ness by extend## ing the number of area## s in which decision## s are take## n by qualified major## ity , thu## s ens## uring that one country can## not put a span## ner in the work## s . 
more democratic account## ability is introduce## d by remo## val of much decision @## -## @ making from the back## room## s , and by making the Council &apos;## s decision @## -## @ making meet## ing## s public . 
final## ly , the Constitution bring## s us more right## s for the citizen## s : social dia## logue , the inclus## ion of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , as well as the citizen## s &quot; initiative , of course . 
any## one who fail## s to support this import## ant step in the European integration process will become respons## ible for perpetu## ating the present Treat## y of N## ice , which is more bureaucrat## ic , s## lower , and in man## y ways un## democratic . 
our &apos; y## es &quot; is one that is ting## ed with a critical observ## ation , be## cause Europe is s## till ver## y much lack## ing one voice . 
social Europe is s## till in## adequate## ly anchor## ed ; hence a critical &apos; y## es . &quot; 
in short , the Dutch delegation with## in the P## SE Group give## s a critical &apos; y## es &quot; to the Constitution . 
a## round the refer## endum in the spring , we will be enthusiast## ical## ly advoc## ating this position , support## ed by Jo## han Cru## y## ff , Cata## lan Dutch## man or Dutch Cata## lan in the S## pan## ish campaign . 
in that way , we are hop## ing to gain support in the N## ether## land## s for this new project , the new Constitution . 
Mr President , Ireland held two refer## enda on the N## ice Treat## y : in the first we vot## ed &apos; No &apos; and in the second we vot## ed &apos; Ye## s &apos; . 
there we## re man## y reason## s for this , but an over## rid## ing one was that our govern## ment took it## s citizen## s for grant## ed . 
the Irish had al## ways vot## ed &apos; Ye## s &apos; to Europe , s## o this time the## y thought it would be the same . 
how## ever , on this occasion , the politic## ians go## t it wrong . 
we have to learn from our mistake## s and ensu## re that , this time , citizen## s have e## asy access to all the inform## ation the## y require . 
I would go s## o far as to suggest that every household should receiv## e a copy of the draft Treat## y - certain## ly every household that re## quest## s one . 
this will be expensive , but it is well worth pay## ing that price . 
further## more , I would ver## y strong## ly support a suggest## ion to publish a document out## lining , on the one hand , what is al## read## y in place in the exist## ing Treat## ies and , on the other , out## lining what is new , change## d or different . 
un## like the assert## ions from some speaker## s in this House today , this is not tell## ing people what to do or how to think ; it is giving our citizen## s a cho## ice . 
if you we## re s## itt## ing a public examin## ation in Ireland , you might be ask## ed to compar## e and contrast . 
this is what we need to do : to assess if what we now have is an improve## ment or other## wise . 
in spite of the scath## ing reference## s of man## y Euro## sceptic## s , I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the Ho## ly Gra## il or the Second Com## ing , but it is a posit## ive step forward for Europe and one that I will support . 
I have man## y reason## s for say## ing this , but time allow## s me to mention just one today . 
this Treat## y bring## s the EU close## r to it## s citizen## s . 
for ex## ample , a million citizen## s &apos; sign## ature## s can prompt the Commission to draft a propos## al . 
that is people power ! 
just imagin## e the possibil## ities : citizen## s from Latvia , Spa## in , Ireland or Swede## n , for ex## ample , find## ing common cause and demand## ing action . 
s## ure## ly , that is the possibil## ity of a citizen## s &apos; Europe ! 
Mr President , there are some thing## s to admir## e in this Constitution but there are also man## y thing## s to dis## like . 
on balance my party ha## s decide## d that it can## not re## commend it to the people of Scot## land , and accord## ing## ly will not be vot## ing for the report . 
we have a number of object## ions to the Constitution it## self , but in the second## s remain## ing I will simpl## y mention the in## adequate subsid## i## arity provision## s . 
Scot## land is not in## dependent y## et , but the Scott## ish Parliament is al## read## y the on## ly body respons## ible for justice , the environment , educ## ation , health and man## y other area## s of Scott## ish life . 
the provision## s in this Treat## y for in## corpo## rating it in## to the EU law @## -## @ making process are in## adequate . 
we have seen in the field of fisher## ies the disastrous con## sequenc## es of EU legisl## ation be## ing in## adequate## ly sensitiv## e to re## ality on the ground with## in the Member State## s or ter## rit## ories of the Union , and this Constitution will not sufficient## ly improve EU law @## -## @ making for Scot## land . 
more to the point , it does not take account of the dign## ity of my country . 
we can## not re## commend it to the people of Scot## land and will not be vot## ing for it . 
Mr President , I am from a country with a constitut## ion that enshrine## s the truth about fundamental human right## s : the truth that the## y are part of human nature and essential to human dign## ity ; the truth that a sup## reme be## ing , not a mer## e human institution , ga## ve these right## s to us - all of us with## out except## ion . 
in Ireland we have had govern## ments which have neglect## ed or even deni## ed our right## s , but under the s## helter of our constitut## ion , even the most vulner## able of us can demand them . 
the EU Constitution expound## s the false position that the EU creat## es all right## s , even fundamental right## s . 
here , the EU is not the guard## ian of right## s , but the give## r . 
I would not dream of support## ing this Constitution . 
it ha## s not grasp## ed the simpl## e and import## ant truth of fundamental human right## s . 
histo## ry tell## s us that when human institution## s become the give## r of right## s , right## s become gift## s . 
the## y can be bestow## ed selective## ly , deni## ed , or even take back . 
I will support the truth that the fundamental right## s of the human person are from God . 
I will defend the Irish constitut## ion again## st usurp## ation . 
- Mr President , first of all I believ## e that we need to express our grat## itude to the member## s of the Convent## ion on the Futu## re of Europe who prepar## ed this Constitution and , at the same time , to congratul## ate the head## s of the Member State## s who sign## ed the Constitution on 29 October 20## 04 . 
nor should we forget the chair## man of the Convent## ion , Mr Gis## card d &apos;## Esta## ing , whom we need to thank . 
I do not intend to repeat every## thing that ha## s be## en s## aid in favour of the Constitution or every## thing that ha## s be## en written in the rapporteur## s &apos; report or every## thing s## aid by the rapporteur## s . 
I fully endorse every## thing that ha## s be## en s## aid and I congratul## ate them on the excel## lent report which the## y have submit## ted . 
I sincere## ly congratul## ate bo## th Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## g## ο . 
Τ## he text of the Constitution which we are deba## ting is not by any mean## s perfect , as every## one ha## s s## aid . 
how## ever , it is the best which there could be under current political circum## stance## s . 
it creat## es a more democratic and more operation## al Union and make## s it more cred## ible and valid bo## th at home and a## broad . 
the European Union is going down in global histo## ry as a union of states which aim## s to serve value## s . 
man , the European citizen , the individual , stand## s at the epi## centre of the constitutional arrange## ments . 
human## itarian solid## arity is also transfer## red to state level with the provision on the defence of a Member State in the e## vent of attack again## st it . 
it is precise## ly this solid## arity which I emphasis## e in the amend## ment which I have table## d and I call on you to vot## e for it . 
the adopt## ion of the Constitution for Europe is a huge step forward . 
it is a mile## stone on the road to the futur## e . 
th## ose who do not believ## e in the European Union will natural## ly find clever legal excus## es for political pre## text## s to de## ride the Constitution and the## y have every right to do s## o . 
how## ever , the## y should respect one thing : that the## ir govern## ments , all the govern## ments have sign## ed this Constitution . 
that is why , ir## respect## ive of the reserv## ations and the individual object## ions which we have , we all need to act and work for the approval of this Constitution , for it## s rat## ification by all the Member State## s 
support## ing this tru## ly excel## lent report give## s the European Parliament bo## th a great opportun## ity and a great respons## ibility to encourag## e our European fellow citizen## s to support the European Constitution## al Treat## y . 
our mess## age to the citizen## s whom we represent here is that the accept## ance of the European Constitution## al Treat## y is a tru## ly except## ional step forward in the development of our common European home and that it is in## de## ed a pre## requisite for it## s progress in all area## s . 
it is but a step from European diploma## cy to European demo## cracy . 
if the wor## st we## re to happen , and for these or other reason## s the agree## ment we## re not to be ratifi## ed , this would not simpl## y be a case of Europe running in place ; it would be a significant and a danger## ous step back## ward## s . 
it would endanger our ef## fort## s to bring about a futur## e that seek## s not on## ly peace , but economic and social progress ; a futur## e in which a democratic Europe will remain an active and influen## tial play## er on the international political s## tage . 
Mr President , I also wish to congratul## ate the rapporteur## s . 
how## ever , I would like to ask for more noise and excite## ment over the small clause , under &apos; particip## atory demo## cracy &apos; , that deal## s with the citizen## s &apos; right of initiative . 
this , above all , make## s a re## ality of bring## ing Europe close## r to it## s citizen## s . 
it build## s on the right to petition , but more th## an that it is a posit## ive right that allow## s our citizen## s to begin to set the age## nda . 
in my own country , in compar## ison , citizen## s have no right of initiative , petition## s languish on shelve## s , legisl## ative initiative## s re## ly on parliament## arian## s win## ning a ballot - it is a sort of game of chance - and even th## en the initiative will prob## ably be talk## ed out by colleague## s , with the citizen## s having no real place . 
I am ver## y proud that this nas## cent EU right offer## s more : a real opportun## ity for our citizen## s to particip## ate in and to move Europe . 
let us there## fore have a loud fan## fare for this step to## ward## s direct demo## cracy , European @## -## @ style . 
Mr President , we are all aware that the Constitution## al Treat## y is bad news . 
it is legal non## sense , it is over## ly complex and it is ridd## led with ide## ology . 
the thick to## mes of sever## al hundred page## s are in## comprehens## ible to the average citizen of an EU Member State . 
the## y are written in the spirit of the French R## evolution - an enlighten## ed , revolution## ary and secular spirit . 
there is no room in the Treat## y for God or tradition## al , European , Christ## ian , Roman , Greek and La## tin value## s . 
there is no room either for the value## s that are dear to us , s## uch as the nation , the fami## ly , human life , faith and tradition## s . 
these value## s have be## en replace## d by secular , social## ist , stupid and bizarre value## s , s## uch as the worship of M## other Earth , or ra## ther Ga## ia , right## s for homo## sexual## s and power for Bru## ssels bureaucrat## s . 
this is some## thing we can## not consent to and n## ever will . 
the report we are deba## ting is mislead## ing , bias## ed and deceptive . 
it is pur## e propag## anda , and on## ly ha## s posit## ive thing## s to say about the Treat## y . 
where is the truth in all of this ? 
you should be ashamed of your## selves ! 
a bias## ed report full of propag## anda ha## s be## en produce## d and distribut## ed at the expense of the citizen## s of the Member State## s , and it is a s## tain on the con## science of the European Parliament . 
we should be ashamed of our## selves . 
the revolution must tru## ly have gone a long way for the truth to be abuse## d in s## uch a fashion . 
fortunate## ly , Po## land will reject this Treat## y , and I hope other countries will follow suit . 
the League of Pol## ish Fami## lies and the In## depend## ence and Demo## cracy Group will vot## e again## st the report . 
&apos;## No &quot; to the Constitution## al Treat## y ! 
Mr President , I should like to begin by say## ing that I can## not agree with the pre## vi## ous speaker . 
I should like to express my sincere thank## s to all the member## s of the European Convent## ion . 
the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s ma## de a particular## ly valu## able contribut## ion to this Convent## ion , some## thing which as a young MEP I was particular## ly glad to see . 
Mr T## eu## f## el , Mr Brok and Mr Wuerme## ling are name## s that deserve mention in this connect## ion , but I should like to thank e## ach and every one of the particip## ants for the work the## y car## ried out d## uring a period of s## uch cruc## ial import## ance for the futur## e of Europe . 
I found it all the more regret## table that the Council , not long after the Convent## ion had complete## d it## s democratic work , us## ed an ur## gent procedure to revise it## s out## come to bring it in## to line with it## s wish## es . 
it is un## fortunate that the democratic nature of the Convent## ion &apos;## s work was some## what tarnish## ed as a result of this . 
n## ever## the## less , I support the Constitution and do not believ## e that it require## s detail## ed ex## plan## ations , as the pre## vi## ous speaker s## aid , but that it creat## es a clear , trans## parent and more citizen @## -## @ friend## ly Europe . 
if I may go in## to detail on one point , I believ## e that one aspect of the Constitution which represent## s major progress is the fact that co## operation between the European Parliament , on the one hand , and the national parliament## s , on the other , will improve our contact## s with the national parliament## s , and en## able us to gain a more detail## ed idea of how the legisl## ation for which we often mer## e## ly lay down the frame## work is trans## posed direct## ly in the nation states . 
particular## ly helpful in this regard is the fact that we have a clear deline## ation of compete## nce## s between national and European level## s , and the ear## ly @## -## @ warn## ing system for subsid## i## arity monitor## ing will also have a posit## ive impact . 
I there## fore hope that regulation of a clear## er and more trans## parent structure of compete## nce## s , and the ear## ly @## -## @ warn## ing system for subsid## i## arity monitor## ing , will allow us to achiev## e more effective and better co## operation with our national colleague## s , in order to make legisl## ation in Europe even more trans## parent . 
Mr President , any communit## y in which the separat## ion of power## s is not stipul## ated and the securit## y of right## s is not guarantee## d need## s a Constitution . 
that was stated in the De## clar## ation of the Right## s of Man and of the Citizen of 17## 89 . 
we have wish## ed to follow the path which more th## an two cent## ur## ies ago led to the free## dom of people and people## s and , there## fore , through this Constitution we will have more and better Europe . 
through this Constitution we are resto## ring the im## petus of the Maas## tri## cht Treat## y , we are over## coming the fail## ure of the Treat## y of N## ice and we are bring## ing enlarge## ment and further European## isation together , in real time . 
natural## ly , through this Constitution , the Union will have more legitim## acy , more value## s , more right## s , more demo## cracy and more efficiency in term## s of the Common Fo## reign and Security Poli## cy ; the European Security and De## fence Poli## cy ; the Area of Free## dom , Security and Just## ice ; and also social Europe . 
I would like to stress the support of the European Con## federation of Trade Union## s for the European Constitution , which I believ## e to be tru## ly essential and fundamental . 
this Constitution will have to be improve## d and , of course , appli## ed and develop## ed ambitious## ly when the time come## s . 
no Constitution is perfect , but no Constitution can be improve## d un## less it enter## s in## to force . 
we must there## fore achiev## e it## s rat## ification on time and correct## ly . 
and we will do all of this with sufficient major## ities to continu## e mov## ing forward . 
this is a citizen &apos;## s Constitution which must be perceiv## ed as s## uch . 
in Spa## in , on 20 Fe## bru## ary , we have a d## ate with a refer## endum , with two good friend## s : a Constitution and Europe . 
we will be there . 
Mr President , we face man## y myth## s and red her## ring## s as we try to promot## e the debate on the EU Constitution . 
Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go have done an excel## lent job in the## ir clear and straight## forward ex## plan## ation and advoc## acy of it## s merit## s . 
Mr Corbett , I s## hall prob## ably borrow your word## ing for a pamphlet in my constitue## ncy , but this is in a common good cause . 
one of the red her## ring## s put a## round is whet## her to call the document a &apos; Constitution## al Treat## y &apos; or a &apos; constitut## ion &apos; , but , as the author## s say , this is a steril## e debate . 
it is a treat## y in form , but a constitut## ion in sub## stance . 
why are s## o man## y people , at least in my own country , Brit## ain , s## o fright## ened of the word constitut## ion ? 
every club , every soci## ety ha## s one . 
in fact the UK it## self ha## s one , even though it ha## s n## ever be## en written down all in one place - un## fortunate## ly ! 
the great## est benefit## s of the new Constitution are that , on the one hand , it constrain## s the EU , but on the other , it liberate## s it . 
the power## s of the European Union will be constrain## ed by strength## ened rule## s on limit## s to compete## nce , on parliament## ary scrutin## y , on democratic account## ability and the definition of citizen## s &apos; right## s vis @## -## @ à @## -## @ vis the administ## ration . 
but the Union will also be free## d up to act more effective## ly on the domestic and external challenge## s we face . 
domestic## ally , this is most s## tri## king in the case of justice and home affair## s . 
we will be able to act more decisive## ly to manage our border## s and im## migration and to tackle serious crime , as our citizen## s want us to do . 
we will also be able to act more effective## ly a## broad . 
what an impact it would have ma## de on our public opinion , as well as on the disaster ef## fort , if it had be## en , for ex## ample , a French air## craft car## rier with Germa## n helicopter## s and Brit## ish marine## s assist## ing in Aceh in Indonesia , and not just American one## s . 
some claim to see in the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s - which will become legal## ly bind## ing - a threat . 
I see it as an opportun## ity . 
the anti @## -## @ European## s have to understand that it will some## time## s act in the sense of constrain## ing the EU institution## s and giving re## dress again## st abuse of power## s by them . 
there is there## fore no reason for people to fear and every reason to welcome the Constitution - and in## de## ed this report . 
Mr President , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , the draft European Constitution make## s the European citizen a major play## er in the construct## ion of a unit## ed Europe . 
the draft Constitution will be subject to the approval of our countries . 
Hung## ary and Lithuania have al## read## y s## aid y## es to it , and that is some## thing about which we are de## light## ed . 
in the form of a s## ing## le document that is more easi## ly read## able th## an the current treat## ies , the Constitution re## affirm## s the double legitim## acy of a Union of states and of citizen## s . 
the Council of Minister## s will reach it## s decision## s on a qualified major## ity bas## is in a great## er number of area## s . 
the Presidency of the European Council will be stabilis## ed with a two @## -## @ and @## -## @ a @## -## @ half @## -## @ year term of office . 
the Commission will see the number of it## s member## s reduce## d and it## s co## ordination strength## ened . 
external## ly , the appoint## ment of a European Fo## reign Minister will final## ly en## able Europe to s## peak with a s## ing## le voice out## side our common border## s . 
the drama of the tidal wave in South @## -## @ East Asia illust## rates o## nce again the import## ance of s## uch vis## ibility and of the increas## ed co## ordination of European action in the world . 
the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , together with the Commission## er , have detail## ed the democratic progress represent## ed by the draft European Constitution . 
the Constitution will also en## able European## s over## sea## s to assert the## ir particular asset## s and to contribut## e to the emerge## nce of an active new European front## ier , a show## case for progress in solid## arity and divers## ity . 
European## s have every## thing to gain from ap## prov## ing the rat## ification of the European Constitution . 
the## y will become it## s major proponent## s and en## able the European Union to function better and with more clar## ity and trans## par## ency , while at the same time establish## ing a balance## d and s## table distribut## ion of power## s at the different level## s of decision @## -## @ making : European , national and regional . 
Mr President , follow## ing the ex## ample of our group , the Belgian Socialist delegation will vot## e in favour of this report , which give## s it## s support to a document that constitut## es an import## ant s## tage on the road to European integration . 
Parliament &apos;## s decision will be cruc## ial , democratic## ally and political## ly , to the debate## s that will be conduct## ed with## in the frame## work of the process## es of rat## ification . 
our own decision will be one in favour , even though our &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e will be design## ed to ring up the cur## tain , not to ring it down . 
in other word## s , it will be a combat## ive &apos; y## es , &quot; which should signal a begin## ning and not an end . 
it will be a decision in the affirm## ative be## cause , as man## y of us have point## ed out , this Treat## y present## s significant advance## s . 
how , in## de## ed , can there not be de## light about the fact that the Constitution## al Treat## y grant## s our Parliament new and increas## ed power## s , there## by im## posing a democratic debate with## in the on## ly European institution endow## ed with the legitim## acy of universal suff## rage ? 
how , too , can there not be agree## ment to integrating the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s in## to the body of the Constitution## al Treat## y ? 
our decision will be &apos; y## es , &quot; but a &apos; y## es &quot; design## ed to start the ball roll## ing and with a price attach## ed . 
when it come## s to decision## s take## n by the Council of Minister## s , it will not have escape## d the attentive read## er that , al## though the double major## ity rule ha## s be## en extend## ed , the un## anim## ity rule ha## s be## en maintain## ed for a number of cruc## ial decision## s , including th## ose re## l## ating to the social sphere and to tax## ation . 
in the same way , a number of us are alarm## ed that a Constitution should include , embed## d## ed with## in it## s word## ing , a part that is program## matic in nature and with which we can## not all agree . 
the document is not perfect . 
it will be difficult to progress matter## s in certain social or fiscal area## s , but no more difficult th## an at present . 
what is import## ant is to become aware of the fact that this Constitution is on## ly a s## tage in European integration . 
it is mean## ing## ful on## ly if it herald## s an ambitious futur## e project in which all European citizen## s , begin## ning with the least af## fluent , can glimpse , and hope for , an improve## ment in the## ir conditio## ns of life . 
more th## an in term## s of the Constitution , the EU will be judge## d in term## s of the sub## sequent action## s that it will , or will not , promot## e and in term## s of the strength and political will with which it respond## s , or does not respond , to European## s &quot; hope## s of bring## ing about , or not bring## ing about , the social Europe , or the Europe of the people . 
for us , that must remain the priorit## y . 
Mr President , this is a day of celeb## ration for Europe and for the European Parliament . 
it ha## s take## n over 20 year## s to construct this Constitution but we are get## ting close . 
I will vot## e for this report and for the Constitution for three simpl## e reason## s . 
first## ly , this Constitution was prepar## ed in an open and democratic way . 
I have be## en a civil serv## ant for ten year## s and I have be## en involve## d in negoti## ating three inter## governmental conference## s , including the Amsterdam Treat## y , the N## ice Treat## y and this one . 
I can guarantee that had this be## en an inter## governmental conference from begin## ning to end , we would n## ever have had this Constitution . 
but be## cause we had a Convent## ion , we most certain## ly go## t one . 
second## ly , this Constitution is a good thing . 
there are 4## 48 reason## s for it , all of which are in the Treat## y as article## s . 
there are three key issue## s : first## ly , it make## s the European Union more democratic ; second## ly , it make## s it more effective and , t## hirdly , it make## s it more understand## able . 
t## hirdly , I will vot## e for this report be## cause it is ver## y good . 
I urge any## one who ha## s not read it from begin## ning to end to have a look at it , be## cause it simpl## ifies and clar## ifies the Treat## y in a magnificent way . 
I wish to congratul## ate Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , who are bo## th at present s## peak## ing on the## ir mobile phone## s - I hope the## y are Nokia## s ! - on the## ir excel## lent report . 
if I we## re to bring up just one thing from the Treat## y , it would be on external relation## s . 
just reflect## ing on what happen## ed in Asia , we had had a p## resident , a foreign minister , a common securit## y policy , a defence system , a better cris## is manage## ment system , th## en together we would have go## t much further . 
final## ly , I would urge e## ach and every Member to go home and defend this Treat## y . 
that is most certain## ly what I will do . 
Mr President , Commission## er Wall## s## tröm , honour## ed guest## s in the gall## ery , lad## ies and gentle## men . today &apos;## s debate is in my view the most import## ant debate not on## ly of this session but in the histo## ry of the Union as a whole . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y is a histo## ric mile## stone and a particular## ly emancip## ating moment for the European Comm## un## ity . 
the ver## y fact that , in this plen## ary session , there are represent## ative## s of twen## ty @## -## @ f## ive nation @## -## @ states holding discuss## ions in the## ir own language## s is clear proof of an ability to coexist in equal## ity and to respect common value## s . 
on 1 May of last year , you welcome## d us , or the great major## ity of us , here together , and we , or the great major## ity of us , felt sincere## ly honour## ed . 
today , we are all de## cid## ing together on the adopt## ion of a common prim## ary un## ified legal frame## work respect## ing just th## ose value## s which have allow## ed us to enlarge your assemb## ly . 
I respect the fact that you wait## ed for us and I personal## ly feel honour## ed that I am able to cast my vot## e , be## cause I perceiv## e the Constitution## al Treat## y as an ethical and moral frame## work for European## s , rein## forc## ing our common historical ident## ity , but I also respect the position of individual nation @## -## @ states and the patriot## ism of the## ir citizen## s . 
what more import## ant document could we give our citizen## s ? 
in## de## ed , through the Constitution we are also strength## ening the## ir influence on political decision @## -## @ making and making it possible for them to exert close## r control . 
I have listen## ed care## fully to the reserv## ations of the opponent## s and I should like to say most sincere## ly that the Constitution is a compromis## e , but the adopt## ion of compromis## es is a great feature of all sens## ible , respons## ible and toler## ant people . 
the European Constitution## al Treat## y open## s up new horizon## s for us and also significant## ly emancip## ate## s the European Union with## in the frame## work of international politic## s . 
I believ## e that , by vot## ing for the Constitution## al Treat## y , we are s## end## ing a clear and posit## ive signal not on## ly to the citizen## s of the nation @## -## @ states with## in Europe , but also to the whole world , a signal of our resolv## e to live together in peace and solid## arity . 
- In this Parliament I represent citizen## s of a state , which ha## s al## read## y ratifi## ed the European Union Constitution . 
on 11 N## ov## ember last year , bare## ly two week## s after it## s sign## ing in Rome , Lithuania ratifi## ed this document , the first European Union Member State to do s## o . 
it is tru## e , the decision was ma## de not in a citizen## s &apos; refer## endum , but in one of the last s## itt## ing## s of Parliament be## fore the end of it## s term . 
it is also tru## e that the European Union Constitution was ratifi## ed in Lithuania with## out comprehens## ive discuss## ions on the provision## s of this document , which ought to be known by , or at least familiar to Lithuania &apos;## s citizen## s , above all s## o that the## y are able to take advantage of the opportun## ities offer## ed by the European Union Constitution . 
why do I believ## e that it is necess## ary to vot## e for the rat## ification of this Constitution in the European Parliament ? 
first## ly . y## es , until 20## 09 we can live accord## ing to the Treat## y of N## ice , but it ha## s be## en clear for a while that the enlarge## d European Union can## not work effective## ly with## out necess## ary institutional change## s , with## out a new and effective division of function respons## ibil## ities a## mong## st the institution## s of the European Union , as well as a## mong## st the European Union and Member State## s , a## mong## st the European Parliament and national parliament## s . 
the European Union can## not work well with## out an effective mechan## ism for the enact## ment of re## solution## s , with## out more active particip## ation by citizen## s , and with## out clear and trans## parent account## ability to citizen## s . 
this is as obvi## ous as what is written in the motto of the report by Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go and Mr Corbett - a grown man can## not wear child## ren &apos;## s cloth## es which he grew out of long ago . 
second## ly . the European Union is striv## ing to become one of the most competitive region## s with the most dynamic development in the world . 
I believ## e that while striv## ing for this go## al it is import## ant not on## ly to proper## ly set out the priorit## ies of European Union expansion and to ensu## re that these receiv## e the necess## ary fund## ing , but also to see that there is order in the European Union above all from the stand## point of it## s institution## s . 
I am about to finish , Mr President . 
I would also like a provision about the Christ## ian root## s of the European Union to be include## d in the preamble of the European Union Constitution . 
de## spite the fact that there is no s## uch provision , I will vot## e for the rat## ification of this document which is im## perfect , but sufficient## ly good . 
thank you . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , the European Constitution## al Treat## y is an## other import## ant step in the development of European integration . 
it creat## es the pre## requisite## s for the European Union , follow## ing enlarge## ment , to be able to act as a decisive factor in European development , and , of course , for it also to be able effective## ly to influence development## s in the world . 
I see the benefit of the European Constitution## al Treat## y as be## ing , a## mong other thing## s , that it bring## s the EU close## r to it## s citizen## s , extend## s the right## s of EU citizen## s , enshrine## s the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s in prim## ary law , simpl## ifies the legal system and replace## s the main European Treat## ies current## ly in force with a s## ing## le text . 
the Constitution also reinforce## s the democratic nature of the Union and strength## ens the role of the European Parliament and that of parliament## s in the Member State## s . 
it creat## es the conditio## ns for effective decision @## -## @ making by the European Union , and also clar## ifies the power## s of the European Union with respect to the Member State## s . 
in add## ition , it strength## ens the EU &apos;## s ability to act as a cohes## ive and un## ified power in the international communit## y , which is ver## y import## ant in the light of the even## ts in South @## -## @ East Asia . 
for all these and man## y other reason## s , which are too numer## ous to mention here , social demo## cracies , including the Czech social demo## cracy which I represent here , un## equi## vocal## ly support the draft Constitution## al Treat## y . 
as regard## s my home country , the Czech Republic , the situ## ation with respect to rat## ification of the European Constitution is not going to be simpl## e . 
the European Constitution is oppose## d not on## ly by the communist## s , but also by the conserv## ative right , represent## ed here in the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s . 
I should there## fore like to invit## e Mr Po## ette## ring and the other leader## s of the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y , for ex## ample Mr Kar## as , whom I can see in the Chamber , to come to the Czech Republic and urge the pro @## -## @ European Czech force## s to rat## ify the European Constitution . 
the Civic Democrat## ic Part## y , which you have accept## ed in## to your rank## s , will not do this work for you . 
I thank you . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the real world in which we live is far from be## ing a fair world and change## s are there## fore require## d to tradition## al political model## s . 
what is new and fascin## ating in the European Constitution is the connect## ion between the recogn## ition of a common system of value## s , democratic value## s and human right## s , and the recogn## ition of a common system of author## ity . 
this not## able connect## ion between a project of justice and a method of political s## har## ing is exact## ly how the great philosoph## er Im## manu## el Kant envi## s## aged it . 
the European Constitution is there## fore an act of bo## th political transform## ation and moral transform## ation . 
I am s## end## ing a letter today to the President of Parliament and to you , Commission## er for institutional relation## s , suggest## ing that we set up a TV station const## ant## ly broadcast## ing the work of Parliament and the Council &apos;## s futur## e public work## s to all EU countries . 
last## ly , I wish to pay trib## ute to the rapporteur## s , Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go and Mr Corbett . 
Mr President , the decision## s ma## de by the Head## s of State or Govern## ment at the La## eken Summit have prov## ed to be of s## till great## er significance th## an any## one had foresee## n at that time . 
the whole of today &apos;## s debate ha## s show## n this quit## e clear## ly . 
what was it that drove the Head## s of State or Govern## ment at the La## eken Summit ? 
it was , in re## ality , two thing## s . 
first## ly , the## y want## ed an EU that function## ed more efficient## ly and , second## ly , the## y want## ed an EU that could ensu## re that we too could operate o## nce enlarge## ment had become a re## ality . 
when## ever we have alter## ed the method## s of European co## operation , this ha## s normal## ly happen## ed as a seal## ed @## -## @ off process be## hind closed door## s , follow## ing which the population of Europe ha## s woke## n up one morning to find that lead## ing politic## ians have o## nce more change## d the conditio## ns of co## operation . 
that was not , how## ever , the way in which matter## s proceed## ed this time . 
a Convent## ion was set up , in which I my## self had the pleas## ure of particip## ating . 
I think the Convent## ion di## d some ex## citing work , but it also set a new object## ive for how we are to effect change## s in Europe in the futur## e . 
in futur## e , change## s are to be ma## de as part of an open process . 
we are now , there## fore , present## ed with a new draft Constitution## al Treat## y which we need to discuss with the people . 
that be## ing s## aid , the follow## ing are cruc## ial point## s I should like to emphasis## e . 
first## ly , an integ## ral feature of the new Constitution## al Treat## y is that it provid## es us with value## s concern## ing not mer## e## ly demo## cracy and human right## s , but also the environment and social respons## ibility . 
second## ly , the new Constitution## al Treat## y provid## es us with an assurance that the principle## s of open## ness and demo## cracy , which a modern @## -## @ day form of co## operation can be expect## ed to respect , are also appli## ed in European co## operation . 
as a Member of the Council of Minister## s , I have often wonder## ed at the fact that the population of Europe was not to know how I vot## ed as a minister when we reach## ed the point of taking decision## s . 
now , we are acquir## ing a modern , and open , Constitution## al Treat## y . 
final## ly , we are ens## uring that , via the European Parliament , the elect## ed represent## ative## s of the people are give## n great## er influence . 
all in all , it is a good product that we have debate## d today and that we are to re## commend to the population of Europe . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the challenge that Europe must face over the coming month## s is vital for European integration . 
citizen## s and member## s of parliament## s all a## cross the continent are be## ing call## ed on to adopt a s## ing## le fundamental Char## ter which sanction## s and strength## ens the value## s upon which this Union is found## ed : peace , prosper## ity , demo## cracy , justice , free## dom and solid## arity . 
the new Constitution## al Treat## y is certain## ly not every## thing we had hop## ed it would be , but it## s ver## y exist## ence constitut## es an unprecedented political and historical e## vent , which was in## conceiv## able until a few year## s ago . 
the text we are to adopt strength## ens the democratic legitim## acy of the European Institut## ions and bring## s them close## r to the 4## 50 million men and women who belong to the Union . 
in## de## ed , the Constitution confer## s great## er power## s on national parliament## s and on the European Parliament , in bo## th legisl## ative and political term## s : our citizen## s will also have a great## er say in the democratic process thank## s to the close## r bond between Comm## un## ity institution## s and local communit## ies , the social partner## s and associ## ations . 
our du## ty , as elect## ed represent## ative## s , is to make this particip## ation real , productive and tang## ible . 
Europe will there## by consolidate it## s role as a global play## er . 
this is the main challenge : it is our du## ty and respons## ibility to build a Union which can s## peak with one voice on international issue## s . 
last## ly , cultural ident## ity : de## spite our regret that there is no reference to the Christ## ian root## s upon which our Union is un## deni## ably found## ed , we , as represent## ative## s of the Union of Christ## ian Democrat## s , strenuous## ly support rat## ification of this text . 
the Italia## n Parliament will rat## ify the Treat## y in the coming week## s ; it will be a posit## ive vot## e , a vot## e of encourag## e## ment for other countries where the value of Europe is not felt as deep## ly as it is in I## ta## ly . 
our country , our govern## ment , our party - pre## serv## ing the leg## acy of th## ose men who left the## ir mark on and found## ed Europe - will contribut## e to## ward## s a posit## ive out## come of the rat## ification process , in order to give full effect to the ideal## s in which we Christ## ian Democrat## s have al## ways believ## ed . 
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratul## ating the rapporteur## s on this report , which add## s clar## ity and weight to the debate . 
I was one of the 200 parliament## arian## s who particip## ated in the Convent## ion and produce## d the Convent## ion text , which the IGC sub## sequent## ly took on board to a ver## y large degree . 
I doubt whet## her any Member State constitut## ion ha## s ever be## en prepar## ed in s## uch an open and democratic way . 
I doubt that there is a constitut## ion in any of the Member State## s which achiev## ed the kind of con## sensus that the Convent## ion achiev## ed . 
of the 200 parliament## arian## s particip## ating in that Convent## ion , on## ly eight sign## ed an alter## native text , basic## ally argu## ing for the dis## integration of Europe . 
we have heard that case be## ing put here this morning , with Mr Alli## ster of North## ern Ireland argu## ing for a re## version to 19## th cent## ury absolut## e sovereign## ty . 
if Sinn Féin had particip## ated in the debate this morning the## y would - al## though the## y are the direct political opposite## s in North## ern Ireland - have be## en making exact## ly the same case . 
per## hap## s it is a kind of progress that the## y agree on 19## th cent## ury absolut## e sovereign## ty , al## though it is un## fortunate that the## y continu## e to fall out over the out## come of the Batt## le of the Boy## ne in 16## 90 ! 
the fact is that this is a world in which the respons## e to natural disaster## s and to man @## -## @ ma## de problem## s clear## ly require## s trans## national govern## ance . 
un## ique## ly in the world , Europe is develop## ing a democratic form of trans## national govern## ance . 
this Constitution will give us more demo## cracy , more right## s and more potent## ial for a prosper## ous soci## ety in Europe , and in## de## ed for solid## arity with the rest of the world . 
to conclude , th## ose out## come## s will not happen of the## ir own accord . 
we have to work for them , us## ing this Constitution as the bas## is for our work . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , 20## 04 was a particular## ly note## worthy year in the histo## ry of European integration , and it had bo## th high and low point## s . 
there can be no doubt that the high point## s include## d the enlarge## ment of the Comm## un## ity from 15 to 25 Member State## s , and the indic## ations give## n in Dec## ember 20## 04 that further enlarge## ments would follow . 
an## other high point was the sign## ing of the Constitution on 29 October in Rome . 
it is general## ly acknowledg## ed , how## ever , that the European elect## ions we## re a low point , bo## th in term## s of the## ir d## ate and the## ir out## come . 
turn## out for the European elect## ions was lower th## an ever be## fore , and further evidence for this can be seen in the fragment## ation the result## s cause## d in this House . 
proof of this fragment## ation can be found not least in the man## y colour## ful flag## s I see a## round me , and by no mean## s on## ly in front of the build## ing . 
in 20## 05 , there## fore , we must ensu## re that the public become involve## d again in the European project , and I do not believ## e that to be actual## ly s## uch a hard task . 
it is , how## ever , an issue of communic## ation . 
the product we have - the new European Constitution - is a ver## y good one , and we must win people over to it . 
we do not need propag## anda campaign## s ; in## stead , we need reli## able inform## ation , in particular with regard to claim## s that the Constitution will benefit people . 
we should not promise people the moon , but tell them what benefit## s the Constitution will and can bring . 
Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go and Mr Corbett have summarise## d this in four key point## s . 
the Constitution will bring great## er clar## ity and great## er effective## ness to the European Union , as well as more demo## cracy and account## ability and more right## s for citizen## s by mean## s of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
provid## ing inform## ation is not the same thing as refrain## ing from critic## ism , but the first task for s## uch critic## ism must be to make it clear that our product is , in principle , a good one . 
final## ly , it ha## s repeat## ed## ly be## en claim## ed that the public is not interest## ed in a Constitution . 
when we held a public## ity e## vent at the Univers## ity of Graz , how## ever , the Constitution met with more interest th## an toad## s## tool## s or dream interpret## ation . 
this should be an incentiv## e for us to promot## e the Constitution to the public . 
Mr President , I would like to declare that the Italia## n social## ist delegation will be vot## ing for the Corbett @## -## @ Mén## dez de Vi## go draft report , and I would extend my congratul## ations to the rapporteur## s on the qual## ity of the report , in particular the ex## plan## atory statement . 
today the European Parliament ha## s certain## ly reach## ed an histo## ric mile## stone , which bring## s to mind 14 Fe## bru## ary 19## 84 when Altiero S## pin## elli &apos;## s draft Treat## y , of which the Constitution is in some ways the ideal continu## ation , was adopt## ed . 
it matter## s li## ttle if in strict## ly legal term## s the text is a treat## y , but what does matter is the sub## stance : today we are all prepar## ed to call it the Constitution , a term which until just a few year## s ago was often consider## ed un## mention## able . 
th## ose like Altiero S## pin## elli and the F## ed## er## alist Movement , to which I am honour## ed to belong , who believ## ed and s## till believ## e that it is vital to creat## e a tru## e federal state with few but essential compete## nce## s that will ensu## re a role for the European Union in the world , would have wish## ed for a bold## er text . 
n## ever## the## less , this Constitution contain## s in es## s## ence certain fundamental pass## age## s which constitut## e a s## table , last## ing frame## work , on the bas## is of which we must now move forward s## o that the Union can effective## ly do what it## s citizen## s expect . 
I will on## ly quote a few ex## ample## s which I consider to be a priorit## y and which in certain case## s arise from the link with my region , a cross @## -## @ border region . 
first## ly , I would like to mention the establish## ment of the position of Minister for Fo## reign Affair## s , who is the European Union &apos;## s voice on the international s## tage and who guide## s it## s foreign policy . 
the procedure## s which make him , as a member of the Commission , account## able to Parliament are a pre## requisite for the exist## ence of a foreign policy . 
follow## ing the man## y - too man## y - conflict## s which have character## ised re## cent year## s , the citizen## s of Europe are ask## ing us and them## selves what Europe is do## ing . 
second## ly , the EU must be a model of development , a tang## ible test## ament to the fact that it is possible to combin## e development and solid## arity . 
last## ly , I would like to point out that the principle of subsid## i## arity is now a constitutional principle and this strength## ens and guarantee## s it . 
that is an## other reason why I believ## e we must vot## e for this report . 
I support this constitut## ion , how## ever , in my opinion , it is a good thing that in this Parliament we have Member## s that are again## st it . 
let me say why this is s## o . 
not be## cause I agree with the argument## s that the## y are put## ting forward , on the contr## ary I think that man## y of the## ir argument## s are bas## ed on mistake## n , or even false pre## mis## es . 
but be## cause with## out any## one op## posing it , we will end up having a mono## ton## ous debate where every## one would be in favour and where we would have a lack of object## ive ana## lysis . 
there is no better way by which one can win an argument about Europe as when one ha## s the courage to compar## e the argument## s in favour with th## ose again## st . 
we have to take serious## ly the argument## s of who## ever is again## st and treat them with respect . 
but we should not be afraid or run away from the argument## s of who## ever is again## st , let al## one ignor## e them . 
we should not expect to win the argument if we do not expose our## selves to an open debate , other## wise we will end up say## ing that we have won the game when in fact on## ly one team would have come to play . 
after all , when one compar## es the argument## s in favour of this constitut## ion with the argument## s again## st , one will not take long to conclude that the constitut## ion ha## s much more that is good in it th## an bad and it merit## s the support of the European citizen## s . 
there is no doubt that if we explain to the people what the constitut## ion mean## s , the people will be more in favour th## an again## st it , be## cause the## y understand how logical is the un## ification of Europe , that it make## s sense and that it is in the## ir interest . 
there## fore it is of ut## most import## ance that who## ever is in this room , who## ever in this Parliament is in favour of this constitut## ion , ha## s to commit him## self or her## self direct## ly with the people to see that the## y understand it and support it . 
this support will be bas## ed on the compar## ison of the argument## s and there## fore it will be on a more open , more balance## d and a more democratic debate . 
Mr President , a Constitution for Europe is necess## ary : it is a democratic require## ment . 
pro## found## ly attach## ed to the un## ity of the party , the French Socialist## s will conduct the national debate with## out in any way giving up our progress## ive value## s and idea## s . 
I consider that approval of the report is the conditio## n for establish## ing Parliament &apos;## s author## ity in respect of the Constitution## al Treat## y , but I am s## or## ry that amend## ments table## d by a number of us have be## en reject## ed . 
non## e## the## less , we s## hall be part of this long and treacherous process that is the rat## ification of the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
we state that this Constitution## al Treat## y is s## table but cap## able of be## ing mod## ified . 
that is the case with all constitut## ions , and with this Treat## y no less th## an with other## s . 
we also regret the fact that a large major## ity of the opinion## s issu## ed by other parliament## ary committee## s that have ident## ified a host of short## coming## s in the Constitution## al Treat## y have be## en left out of this report . 
we are also keen to state clear## ly that a special unit , establish## ed under the Dutch Presidency , will continu## e with it## s work under the futur## e P## reside## ncies and will care## fully scrutin## ise all the possible con## sequenc## es of the Constitution &apos;## s be## ing reject## ed . 
I want Parliament , legitim## ised in it## s role follow## ing this vot## e , to get to grip## s with the difficult## ies of implement## ing the Constitution## al Treat## y and to use it## s parliament## ary right of initiative . 
that is what we are call## ed upon to do , and it is what Amendment No 17 is all about . 
y## es , it is incumb## ent upon our## selves as MEP## s and elect## ed represent## ative## s of the European people to take a pro## active role in implement## ing the Constitution## al Treat## y , which govern## s the corporate life of more th## an 4## 50 million European## s . 
the difficult## ies reveal## ed by the opinion## s of the other committee## s will re## surface s## oon## er or later . 
we must there## fore be prepar## ed to correct the im## perfect## ions bequeath## ed by the Inter## governmental Con## ference when it alter## ed the delicate balance achiev## ed wise## ly and equi## tably by the Convent## ion . 
let us prepar## e our## selves , lad## ies and gentle## men , for a new round . 
it is , in## de## ed , going to be necess## ary to defend our popular legitim## acy in respect of the Constitution## al Treat## y , who## s## e short## coming## s we have an absolut## e du## ty to correct when the time is right . 
a number of my colleague## s in the French delegation will abstain from vot## ing on this report . 
Mr President , this Constitution## al Treat## y is worth uphold## ing . 
as a Christ## ian Democrat , I am pleas## ed that the subsid## i## arity principle ha## s just be## en further work## ed out , deepen## ed and anchor## ed . 
the European Union ha## s now also recognis## ed and enshrine## d the task of the regional dimension , name## ly local and regional author## ities . 
there is a need for a better balance to be s## truck between what happen## s at the centre and away from it , in Bru## ssels , in the nation states and in region## s and municipal## ities . 
as a govern## or at regional level , I notice## d for year## s that EU inform## ation remain## ed at Council level for too long and that region## s and town## s we## re involve## d in the debate and decision @## -## @ making too late . 
as a represent## ative of the European organisation## s , I was also able to attend hear## ing## s of the Convent## ion , particular## ly th## ose about subsid## i## arity . 
the Treat## y text reinforce## s the position of region## s and town## s , which are close to the citizen## s and where import## ant task## s are car## ried out in man## y area## s . 
in that way , the democratic loop## hole , which Mr Pro## di mention## ed in hi## s report on good govern## ance , is closed o## nce more . 
it is an import## ant step that the European Parliament support## s this and remain## s critical about the way in which this Treat## y will be flesh## ed out at local or regional level in the next few year## s . 
I would also suggest that we in this House from time to time ask the Council and the Committee of the Region## s whet## her , a## mong other thing## s , our national states have now learn## ed to communic## ate open## ly about European policy , and whet## her , in the subsid## i## arity test , national parliament## s take the opinion## s of region## s and town## s in## to consider## ation . 
I know that the Committee of the Region## s is develop## ing a similar test . 
in short , this Treat## y is well worth uphold## ing . 
con## sequent## ly , we will labour for this cause at national level , certain## ly if refer## endum## s are on the age## nda . 
- Mr President , the major risk## s from this Constitution are three in number . 
the first is , are we to become a federation , a federation bo## th on foreign affair## s and in defence and else## where , or are we to be a Europe of a loose federation of dis## similar partner## s , e## special## ly after enlarge## ment ? 
the second is , are we to be a Europe of social aware## ness or are we to be a Europe of the open , uncontroll## ed market ? 
the thir## d is , are we to be a Europe with## out a democratic de## ficit , with power in the hand## s of the citizen## s , or are we to be a Europe in which European elect## ions are held and we have abstention## s of 70 , 60 or 50 % ? 
in my opinion , this Constitution answer## s all these question## s most posit## ive## ly , in all even## ts much more posit## ive## ly th## an the## y are address## ed under current treat## ies . 
any## one again## st this Constitution , alleg## ed## ly for reason## s of social sensitiv## ity , need## s to answer the question of whet## her the exist## ing treat## ies help the poor and the weak in Europe more th## an this Constitution help## s them . 
allow me an element of minor national pride as a Greek and as a social## ist : it was d## uring the Greek Presidency , in Ju## ne 20## 03 , that the initial negoti## ations on this Constitution we## re conclude## d , and I am proud of that . 
of course , it now remain## s to be appli## ed and this is where the MEP## s and the govern## ments have a huge respons## ibility . 
we need to ensu## re that the seed## s of social aware## ness s## own in the Constitution do not remain pre## tty word## s and are put in## to practice . 
the famous social mainstream## ing clause setting out the Union &apos;## s oblig## ation to ensu## re that it## s every policy promot## es the object## ive## s of high employ## ment , environment## al protection , public health , educ## ation and equal## ity between men and women can on## ly be appli## ed under good law## s . 
similar## ly , I must tell you that , for any MEP## s striv## ing for a social## ly fair## er Europe , this is a particular## ly pain## s## taking and particular## ly welcome challenge . 
for man## y people , the institution## s in Bru## ssels seem remote . 
the## y see them as centre## s of power where decision## s are ma## de over which the## y have no influence . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y is not a miracle cure for all the problem## s of the European Union , but it is an opportun## ity to reduce democratic short## coming## s and to speed up Europe &apos;## s development . 
why ? 
be## cause it replace## s numer## ous agree## ments and amend## ments , there## by re## duc## ing the lack of trans## par## ency in key European Union document## s ; be## cause in a s## ing## le document it bring## s together the key constitutional and legal found## ations and poli## cies of the European Union ; be## cause it is the bas## is for more effective function## ing of European institution## s ; be## cause it contribut## es to the implement## ation of the Lisbon Strategy ; be## cause it re## move## s the problem## s that would arise we## re the current agree## ments to continu## e to be us## ed in the futur## e . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y is a compromis## e that does not complete## ly satisf## y any## one , but it non## e## the## less most represent## s what we have be## en able to achiev## e in the convention . 
we need the Constitution## al Treat## y be## cause with## out it we can## not expect any effective reform## s or effective function## ing in the enlarge## d Europe . 
al## though the chap## ter on poli## cies ha## s frequent## ly be## en criticise## d , as a shadow rapporteur I must express my satisf## action that in the area of social policy and employ## ment ver## y concrete commit## ments have be## en set out for the Commission and the govern## ments of the Member State## s , including the establish## ment of a Committee for Soci## al Protect## ion and European Soci## al Har## mon## y . 
by accept## ing the report on the Constitution## al Treat## y , the European Parliament is s## end## ing a clear signal to the people of Europe that the time ha## s come for a trans## parent and whole## sale re## arrange## ment of our constitutional and legal found## ations , there## by ens## uring that Europe become## s a continent of peace , prosper## ity , solid## arity and securit## y . 
final## ly I should mention that the Slovenia## n parliament will rat## ify the Constitution## al Treat## y this month . 
I am convince## d that it will do s## o by a large major## ity . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I reject total## itarian regime## s . 
my grand## mother &apos;## s fami## ly died in the Nazi gas chamber## s . my father was incarce## rated by the communist regime . 
we have paid in blood for our commit## ment to the free## dom of con## science , which was embodi## ed for us by Europe as a hope for demo## cracy , free## dom of thought , religious free## dom and free## dom of con## science . 
I believ## e that non## e of you would consider me to be anti @## -## @ European if I we## re to pose a few question## s . 
why is the European Parliament pro## nounc## ing on the Constitution## al Treat## y be## fore the citizen## s of the individual states ? 
do we need Europe to be govern## ed by a constitut## ion ? 
the sovereign## ty of Member State## s should not be threaten## ed . 
if , how## ever , the Constitution strength## ens the role of Parliament , but does not define the compete## nce## s of the European Court of Just## ice , will the balance between institution## s thu## s be up## set ? 
decision## s of the Court will be direct## ly impose## d on Union bodies and Member State## s with## out any right of appeal . 
the European Court of Just## ice will be free from any critic## ism . 
can we pretend that this will not happen ? 
the draft Constitution contain## s no guarantee## s that the European Court of Just## ice will not appropriate some of the exclus## ive compete## nce## s of the sovereign states , even contr## ary to national constitut## ions . 
even if the major## ity in this Parliament change## s after the elect## ions and the com## position of the Council change## s , a double un## anim## ity will be require## d in order to change poli## cies . 
and I just wonder : will s## uch a Union be cap## able of development if it## s direct## ion is set by this Constitution ? 
our civil## isation ha## s develop## ed from Christ## ian root## s . 
if the Constitution fail## s to acknowledg## e this historical fact , un## rest will be introduce## d in## to the life of soci## ety . 
a new ide## ology will rise up under a mask of tolerance . 
are we to build the European home on a distort## ion of histo## ry ? 
is it tru## e that , with## out this Constitution , the con## cept of a unit## ed Europe will di## e ? 
I think not . 
my vot## ers have put the## ir faith in me and I wish to proceed in Europe s## o that every## one , including the small## est , weak## est and poor## est , are accept## ed in## to it and can find the## ir place## s in it . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , in a democratic Europe , I ask that we respect the free## dom of con## science when vot## ing . 
Mr President , de## spite all the differ## ence## s of opinion which the debate surround## ing this issue ha## s produce## d , we are o## nce again making European histo## ry . 
as s## uch , this Treat## y is an import## ant step in the right direct## ion . 
I am certain that the found## ers of the move## ment for European integration would be proud and pleas## ed if the## y we## re now witness## ing just how man## y fundamental issue## s have result## ed in s## uch compromis## es that Parliament is now deba## ting and vot## ing on them . 
it is un## fortunate that in some countries the debate on the Treat## y ha## s be## en take## n out of con## text and us## ed to fuel an internal and party political row . 
the wor## st feature## s of European## isation , in## tolerance and j## ing## o## ism , are all too often visible and aud## ible at s## uch time## s , al## though attempt## s are ma## de to conceal them in the form of lies disguise## d as lofti## er aspi## rations . 
when this Treat## y ha## s come in## to force , there is no chance that it will lead to the creation of a European super## state : on the contr## ary , it## s spirit and text will effective## ly block any self @## -## @ seek## ing aspi## rations on the part of states , group## s of states or extremis## t move## ments . 
the Treat## y will s## till allow the econom## y to play the role best suit## ed to it in co## operation with## in the continent . 
the dynamic## s of mutual economic activity and the s## ing## le monetar## y policy are also precondition## s of political co## operation . 
with## out demo## cracy there is no social dimension , and there is no demo## cracy with## out a market econom## y . 
I am also proud that in my own country , Fin## land , we have be## en able to agree that Parliament can decide on the rat## ification of the Treat## y at national level . 
while ap## prov## ing the report submit## ted , I would like to reiterate o## nce more that Lithuania , on the decision of it## s Parliament , was the first to rat## ify this Constitution . 
after the re## cent elect## ions , Lithuania &apos;## s social democrat## s , who we## re and remain in power , took an active part in the task of prepar## ing the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
when countries we## re invit## ed to set down in legal term## s the thing## s which after delibe## ration all general## ly agree## d on , we di## d this with## out delay . 
we had good ground## s for this . 
in a refer## endum held a year and a half ago , Lithuania## ns ga## ve the clear## est &apos; Ye## s &quot; to European Union member## ship of all the new Member## s . 
support in Lithuania for European Union member## ship continu## es to grow and ha## s reach## ed 82 % . 
people see that the hope## s associate## d with the European Union are be## ing fulfill## ed , and s## o the## y want to strength## en it . 
the fail## ure of a refer## endum on the Constitution in any country of the European Union would , I believ## e , be a pain## ful blow to the hope## s of the major## ity of European## s , a## mong them Lithuania## ns . 
today the European Union ship al## read## y contain## s 25 states , but is s## ailing with far too weak an engine for s## uch a car## go - the Treat## y of N## ice . 
if it is not replace## d with a much more power## ful one - the engine of the Constitution## al Treat## y - our common ship will reduce speed and may begin to drift . 
with the old N## ice engine we will n## ever achiev## e the go## al## s define## d in the Lisbon strate## gy , and we will be un## able to implement new neighbour poli## cies effective## ly . 
this is particular## ly relev## ant to the new European Union countries . 
a strong democratic European Union mov## ing forward - this is essential , not just in the interest of our country . 
the Constitution## al Treat## y - no matter how complic## ated a compromis## e it might be - contribut## es to this . 
Lithuania ratifi## ed it with resolv## e , s## o that the energ## y and optim## ism of the new countries might be pass## ed on to the European Union &apos;## s old @## -## @ time## rs . 
thank you . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I am de## light## ed that this substanti## al report by Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go ha## s be## en table## d . 
as a former substitute member of the Convent## ion , I must admit that I might re## commend to some people that the## y read this report ra## ther th## an the Constitution it## self , as it is sup## reme## ly read## able and extreme## ly convincing on the issue . 
today I should like to address my comment## s to th## ose Member## s of this House who have take## n a critical approach to the Constitution . 
the## y have warn## ed again## st the creation of a European super## state and denounc## ed short## coming## s , and the## y have come out in op## position to mistake## s ma## de in the past . 
I believ## e we should make it ver## y clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of address## ing these short## coming## s . 
the European Constitution reme## dies man## y of the problem## s that all of us have experience## d with Europe as it exist## s today . 
it lay## s down a system of compete## nce## s and grant## s national parliament## s the right of particip## ation , thu## s making Europe less central## ist and less bureaucrat## ic . 
the Constitution give## s the European Parliament a full say , and Europe will there## fore become more democratic th## an it ha## s be## en to d## ate . 
it also strength## ens citizen## s &quot; right## s , above all by mean## s of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , as citizen## s will be able to invoke the Constitution direct## ly when appeal## ing again## st European decision## s . 
final## ly , the Constitution provid## es this Europe of our## s with a bas## is of value## s , and is thu## s a way of counter## ing the technocrat## ic approach to political problem## s . 
the Euro## sceptic## s should there## fore re## ally be in favour of this Constitution , as it is the on## ly way of changing the thing## s we all wish to change . 
today is the annivers## ary of the birth of Alex## ander Ham## il## ton , one of the father## s of the American Constitution , who## s## e picture can today be found on ten @## -## @ dollar note## s . 
as I look at the father## s and mother## s of the European Constitution in this House , I hope that the## y will also be re## member## ed as grat## e## fully in 200 year## s &quot; time . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I would first of all like to congratul## ate the rapporteur## s on a ver## y thorough report . 
this document summarise## s except## ion## ally well the most essential point## s of the European Constitution . 
at the same time , I would like to see a s## light## ly different emphasis regard## ing the public## ising of the Constitution . 
in it## s conclusion## s , today &apos;## s report concentr## ate## s on print## ed material## s about the Constitution . 
how## ever , public survey## s and common log## ic tell us that European citizen## s prim## arily look for and receiv## e inform## ation via tele## vision , including inform## ation about the EU . 
today &apos;## s report stress## es the need to clear## ly distinguish every point in the Constitution## al Treat## y that differ## s from exist## ing treat## ies . 
this , how## ever , is more a topic for academ## ic research ra## ther th## an inform## ation to be relay## ed to every European citizen . 
the 3## 00 @## -## @ page Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe is vo## lumin## ous en## ough as it is , and con## sequent## ly also more complex th## an the constitut## ions of the Member State## s . 
there is no common European public opinion y## et , but in my home country Estonia , for ex## ample , support for the EU ha## s grown with every month since Estonia &apos;## s access## ion . 
at the same time support is fall## ing in man## y Member State## s . 
n## ever## the## less , the same rule appli## es bo## th in journal## ism and in public inform## ation through## out Europe : people must be give## n what the## y want . 
in old and new Member State## s , in c## ities and in the country , people are prim## arily interest## ed in what effect the European Constitution will have on the## ir every## day life . 
I believ## e that in present## ing the Constitution , we should concentr## ate on the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
for in## stance , what does the right to good administ## ration stipul## ated in the Char## ter mean for e## ach citizen ? 
to what ex## tent will s## uch a require## ment force bureaucrat## s or politic## ians to just## ify the## ir decision## s , or to be open ? 
answer## s to question## s s## uch as these should be an integ## ral part of public inform## ation about the Constitution . 
also , in conclusion , I would say that there can be no talk of inform## ing the citizen## s of Europe if tele## vision is not include## d . 
the Parliament &apos;## s Director## ate @## -## @ General for In## formation should take this in## to account in it## s ef## fort## s to public## ise the Constitution . 
I wish them and all the European tele## vision network## s success in translat## ing the Constitution &apos;## s complex word## ing in## to a pala## table form## at for the public . 
thank you . 
- Mr President , tomor## row &apos;## s vot## e is of histo## ric import## ance . 
the significant progress be## ing ma## de with the European Constitution and the advantage## s which deriv## e from it## s posit## ive provision## s have al## read## y be## en present## ed bo## th in the full report by my honour## able friend## s Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go and today in this Chamber . 
as , there## fore , al## most all the issue## s have be## en exhaust## ed , I s## hall confine my## self to one vital problem . 
a new mar## athon start## s from tomor## row for rat## ification by the Member State## s . 
but what will happen if there is some problem with rat## ification by some Member State ? 
the Constitution does not contain a specific provision to deal with this eventual## ity . 
non## e## the## less , the decla## rations re## l## ating to the provision## s of the Constitution state that , if two year## s after sign## ature of the Constitution , 4 / 5 of the Member State## s have ratifi## ed the Constitution in question and one or more Member State## s are fac## ing difficult## ies in connect## ion with rat## ification , the matter will be submit## ted to the European Council . 
do you , how## ever , think that this arrange## ment is satisfactory ? 
I believ## e that there should be a much clear## er provision . 
un## fortunate## ly , how## ever , this arrange## ment also emerge## d from the s## eries of compromis## es which we## re necess## ary in order for us to get where we are today . 
there## fore , it is not en## ough for us to talk and to support the rat## ification of the Constitution un## reserv## ed## ly . 
all the govern## ments and all of us need to work to avoid s## uch an un## fortunate development if we want to enter a new er## a for our continent . 
- Mr President , by adopt## ing the report by Mr Corbett and Mr M## è## n## dez de Vi## go , Parliament will be making it## s last major contribut## ion to## ward## s the adopt## ion of a constitutional Treat## y for Europe . 
the exist## ence of s## uch a Treat## y will enshrine the histo## ric transit## ion from a Comm## un## ity of people## s and countries progress## ive## ly unit## ed by ever @## -## @ close## r economic ties to an actual political Comm## un## ity unit## ed by the desir## e for a common futur## e . 
fif## ty year## s of a policy of small , prudent step## s ha## s pave## d the way for a new re## ality bas## ed on share## d value## s , civil## ised value## s that express a share## d European ident## ity bas## ed on peace , demo## cracy , human right## s and economic and social progress . 
Europe is not be## ing built at vari## ance with the secular re## ality of the nation## s on our continent . 
Europe is found## ed upon the free and inform## ed desir## e to ensu## re that the past does not repeat it## self and to provid## e it## s people## s with guarantee## s that the## y will remain master## s of the## ir own desti## ny in a futur## e lad## en with challenge## s . 
the champion## s of sovereign## ty , who accus## e Europe of ero## d## ing national sovereign## ty and who see in this Constitution the## ir night## ma## re of a super## state coming tru## e , are pro## found## ly mistake## n in the## ir ana## lysis . 
economic , financial and techno## logical global## isation , the current or potent## ial emerge## nce of new global , political and economic potent## ate## s , have force## d Europe to seek respons## es at national level to defend , deepen and export the human## ist project initiate## d in the last cent## ury by the post @## -## @ war social state under the rule of law . 
in a world that is character## ised by un## certain## ty , dis## order and de## regulation , it is increas## ing## ly necess## ary for Europe to s## peak out and to play an active role , bo## th for us and for th## ose other## s who look to us to set an ex## ample and to take action on matter## s of major international import## ance . 
the champion## s of sovereign## ty are not the on## ly opponent## s of this Treat## y . 
other## s have loud## ly criticise## d it for not going far en## ough , for the fact that result## s have be## en meagre or for it## s lack of ambit## ion . 
s## uch people re## fuse to acknowledg## e the significant progress that ha## s be## en ma## de , be## cause the## y persist with the point## less exerc## ise of compar## ing the constitutional Treat## y be## fore us to the ideal## ised version## s of the## ir dream## s in## stead of compar## ing it to the current Treat## ies and the N## ice process , in particular . 
Mr President , while the European Parliament ha## s no formal role in the rat## ification procedure , I am pleas## ed that , as the elect## ed represent## ative## s of 25 Member State## s of the European Union , we are having this debate today , at a point in time when the rat## ification procedure ha## s just go## t under way at parliament## ary level and is just about to get under way at refer## endum level . 
on the day when head## s of state and govern## ment sign## ed the Constitution in Rome , I happen## ed to be in Br## ati## s## lava , Slovak## ia , where I was privilege## d to particip## ate in the open## ing of the House of Europe . 
that was the first open## ing of a House of Europe in one of the new Member State## s . 
it was follow## ed by the open## ing in Dec## ember of a House of Europe in Pra## gue . 
procedure## s for establish## ing House## s of Europe in all Member State## s are under way . 
the principal function of these House## s of Europe is to bring the European Union close## r to it## s citizen## s . 
the## y offer citizen## s a point of inform## ation that is central## ly and vis## ibly located in the## ir own Member State . 
the con## cept offer## s educ## ation on the European Union and , by provid## ing accommo## d## ation for the political group## s , it ens## ures that the view## s of this Parliament can be convey## ed to the citizen## s . 
it is my belief that if the European Union is to work , we have to strength## en and deepen the relation## ships between this Parliament and the national parliament## s . 
there is no other way in which we can achiev## e that co## operation in the long## er term . 
it should not be an &apos; us and them &apos; situ## ation ; it should be about every## one work## ing together for the better## ment of all people in the 25 Member State## s - or per## hap## s the 27 Member State## s , should that come about . 
that is the challenge for the futur## e ; that is the challenge that we , as democrat## s , have to take on board . 
it take## s two side## s to make a debate . 
be## cause people do not necess## arily agree with every word that other## s say , this does not mean that the## y have no right to say it . 
I believ## e in the right## s of every## one , I believ## e in demo## cracy . 
I believ## e that th## ose who disagree with me have a right to the## ir view## s . 
the major## ity will ultimate## ly win , but th## ose who disagree can make this a better debate , and the## y should be encourag## ed to do s## o and should not be disenfranchise## d from the## ir position . 
Mr President , as this report demonst## rates ver## y well , there are three basic aspect## s to the draft Constitution : first## ly , the Union &apos;## s value## s and object## ive## s , the un## ity and equal## ity of it## s people## s , as well as the protection of the divers## ity of it## s culture## s , ident## ities and language## s ; second## ly , the right## s , interest## s and du## ties of the citizen## s ; and , t## hirdly , the rule## s for the institution## s and for European political life . 
the first two aspect## s - value## s and right## s - define the European demo## cracy we want , bas## ed on the divers## ity and free## dom of the people## s , the## ir progress and equal## ity . 
the thir## d aspect - this should be ma## de clear : the rule## s of play - is the result of compromis## es between Left and Right , between federalist## s and inter## governmental## ists ; it should be ma## de clear that it refer## s to th## ose rule## s , not to the poli## cies to be implement## ed . 
in this respect , the Constitution is not a final desti## nation , but a depart## ure point , with a view to over## coming Europe &apos;## s socio @## -## @ economic lethargy , it## s lack of capacity for innov## ation , research and development and it## s in## sufficient weight on the international s## tage . 
we must move forward to## ward## s a European Govern## ment , mov## ing beyond the current## ly pre## domin## ant method of inter## governmental co## ordination with all it## s im## pot## ence , as demonst## rated by the fail## ure to implement the Lisbon strate## gy and the division## s over the invas## ion of Iraq . 
with this view to## ward## s futur## e progress , we s## hall call for a vot## e in favour of the European Constitution . 
Mr President , a long @## -## @ standing dream of this Parliament , and one share## d by man## y of Europe &apos;## s citizen## s , is be## coming re## ality . 
we have work## ed long and hard for this Constitution , but we can be proud of what ha## s now be## en achiev## ed , and I should like to take this opportun## ity today to thank Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go and Mr Corbett . 
as shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Agri## culture , I can say that we are in favour of this draft Constitution , which un## doubt## ed## ly represent## s a gain for the committee . 
when the common agri## cultural policy was establish## ed in 19## 58 , this House was mer## e## ly a consult## ative body , and it was on## ly with the Treat## y of Amsterdam that we we## re give## n the right of co## decision in the field## s of the environment , consum## er protection and food safety . 
the demo## cracy de## ficit , having persist## ed in spite of every## thing , will now be over## come by mean## s of an extens## ion of the co## decision procedure to include all decision## s of principle on agri## cultural policy . 
there are how## ever also negat## ive side## s to the Constitution . 
in futur## e the Council will be able to take autonomous decision## s on the setting of quota## s , price## s and quantitative restrict## ions , as the draft Constitution take## s no account of the new go## al## s of the common agri## cultural policy follow## ing the EU agri## cultural reform . 
this is a step back## ward## s from the current situ## ation , and it will mean much work for us in the futur## e . 
as a represent## ative of the Germa## n Fede## ral of Bad## en @## -## @ Württem## berg , too , I believ## e that a number of extreme## ly import## ant go## al## s have be## en achiev## ed ; the national constitut## ions have be## en strength## ened , region## s and local author## ities have be## en accord## ed great## er significance , and the principle of subsid## i## arity ha## s be## en adhere## d to . 
the draft Constitution lay## s the found## ations for common economic activities , and we will gain a common bas## is of value## s share## d by all of us , some## thing I see as particular## ly import## ant . 
we have be## fore us a document which place## s an oblig## ation on all th## ose who bear respons## ibility for Europe . 
Mr President , I am ver## y much in favour of the European Constitution , and would like to congratul## ate the rapporteur## s on the## ir out## standing report . 
the Constitution , which above all strength## ens the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice , mark## s a mile## stone on the road to a more secure and just Europe . 
we have take## n a giant step to## ward## s a Europe of citizen## s with this Constitution , as by en## sh## rin## ing in it the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , by EU access## ion to the European Convent## ion on Human Right## s and by simpl## ified access to justice , citizen## s &quot; right## s have be## en give## n an enormous boost . 
in add## ition , we now have increas## ed opportun## ities to co## ordinate our ef## fort## s in the fight again## st s## uch evil## s as crime , rac## ism and xeno## phobia in Europe . 
I welcome the fact that the member## s of the CS## U in this House will vot## e in favour of this report . 
un## fortunate## ly , man## y member## s of the CS## U in the Germa## n , which ha## s y## et to rat## ify the Treat## y , appear to have no ink## ling of the significance and implic## ations of the Constitution , as the## y have announce## d the## ir intention to vot## e again## st it . 
this is y## et an## other ex## ample of the double game which the CS## U is s## o fond of play## ing , which involve## s be## ing progress## ive here in Europe and fly## ing the flag for the benefit of the out## side world , but s## peak## ing out in op## position at home , just in case . 
this is , how## ever , one of the## ir tradition## s , for it was the CS## U that , in 19## 49 , vot## ed again## st Germa## ny &apos;## s Bas## ic Law . 
lad## ies and gentle## men : the trapping## s of the European Union have become too small , and no long## er suit it in it## s new , expand## ed form . 
there## fore it is fitting that the new Constitution will replace agree## ments that are current## ly in force and will lead to more effective function## ing of the European Union . 
it will also strength## en the role of the European Parliament and the national parliament## s , and there## by the voice of the citizen## s of the European Union . 
as a member of the Committee on Cult## ure and Educ## ation , I particular## ly support the article## s of the Constitution that relate to th## ose area## s . 
I believ## e that it is import## ant that the preamble emphasis## es the significance of Europe &apos;## s cultural tradition , Europe &apos;## s human## istic leg## acy and the value## s that define the es## s## ence of Europe and it## s citizen## s . 
one of our great## est object## ive## s is respect for our rich cultural and linguist## ic divers## ity , and concern for the protection and development of the European cultural leg## acy . 
the Constitution guarantee## s free## dom for art and science , the right to educ## ation and professional train## ing , equal right## s for men and women , and the right of the handicap## ped to be full member## s of soci## ety . 
Article 92 guarantee## s the safety of young people at work , and Article 93 states that the fami## ly should enjoy legal , economic and social securit## y . 
the article## s as written form a good bas## is for the## ir implement## ation , but in spite of this the European Union must do much more th## an simpl## y accept and rat## ify the Constitution . 
above all , it must creat## e the conditio## ns under which the fami## ly is recognis## ed as some## thing pre## cious and young mar## ried coup## les have the opportun## ity to creat## e and nurture a fami## ly . 
if we use im## migration as the principal mean## s of solv## ing demo## graphic problem## s , this will jeopard## ise our cultural leg## acy , the language## s of Europe , our culture , our faith , the European Union and European civil## isation in general - in short , all the value## s that we wish to pre## serve and strength## en through the Constitution . 
be## cause we in the 25 Member State## s have opt## ed for this communit## y , it is also fitting that we do every## thing we can to ensu## re that it function## s as well and effective## ly as possible . 
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur## s for the## ir excel## lent work and express my full support for the report we are deba## ting today . 
tomor## row this House will express it## s support for the text which conclude## s a process of creat## ing a constitut## ion which ha## s be## en on## going for sever## al deca## de## s . 
how## ever , our work can## not stop here . 
we s## till have to face the most difficult challenge : it## s approval and rat## ification by the European citizen## s . 
with## out the## ir support , the Constitution make## s no sense . 
as the honour## able Member## s are well aware , we S## pan## ish have a particular respons## ibility with## in this process , since the first refer## endum a## mong## st European citizen## s will be held in my country on 20 Fe## bru## ary . 
we all , there## fore , have the respons## ibility of explain## ing the constitutional text to the European citizen## s , which in my case include## s th## ose Spaniard## s liv## ing out## side of Spa## in and even out## side of the European Union . 
I am , there## fore , pleas## ed that in my country the major## ity of political part## ies , un## ions and other represent## ative## s of civil soci## ety agree with us and are fully involve## d in this task of creat## ing aware## ness of the content and s## cope of the Constitution , which is the on## ly way to ensu## re broad particip## ation and a posit## ive respons## e to this histo## ric task . 
Mr President , the road to this Constitution## al Treat## y was a long and rock## y one , and a number of good propos## al## s fell by the way## side . 
now , though , we need this Constitution , and rat## ification by the Member State## s must progress quick## ly . 
the found## ing father## s , including Robert Schu## man and Kon## rad Adenauer , laid the found## ations for the European house . 
the## ir success## ors built the wall## s , b## ought the shelve## s and fill## ed these shelve## s with fil## es . 
the content## s of this house are now pil## ing up to the roof , and we face the immens## e task of clear## ing out this house and making it fit for the futur## e . 
this is what the European Constitution will help us to do , and it represent## s a compromis## e which will mean great## er open## ness and tang## ible improve## ments for the European public . 
exist## ing Comm## un## ity legisl## ation will be set out in a Treat## y , which will make Europe easi## er to understand . 
the common trade policy will play an exempl## ary role in futur## e in represent## ing our internal market to the out## side world , and the enlarge## d Union &apos;## s capacity to act will be strength## ened by a small## er Commission and by a new EU Fo## reign Minister . 
citizen## s will gain more right## s , and the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , as draft## ed by Roman Her## zog , will be enshrine## d in the Constitution . 
the European Parliament &apos;## s role will be strength## ened ; it will elect the President of the Commission . 
it is to be hop## ed that in futur## e lead## ing politic## ians from European part## ies will stand for this post . 
the Constitution## al Convent## ion allow## ed us too to bring our influence to bear on the Constitution , and Europe will not become a central## ist mon## ster state , but will in## stead be construct## ed accord## ing to the principle of subsid## i## arity . 
the character## istic approach and principle## s of the large## st group in this House , the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s , can also be seen in the Constitution , al## though un## fortunate## ly we di## d not succeed in push## ing through all of our amend## ments , for some of which we f## ought bitter## ly . 
to give but two ex## ample## s , I regret deep## ly that no reference to God ha## s be## en include## d , and that the formula## s for qualified major## ity vot## ing in the Council are s## o complic## ated . 
I would how## ever hope for all our sake## s that this Convent## ion is a found## ation upon which we can continu## e to build Europe , and that this Europe will be one of peace , free## dom and prosper## ity . 
- Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should first like to express my grat## itude to## ward## s the honour## able Member## s Mr de Vi## go and Mr Corbett for an excel## lent## ly prepar## ed document , quit## e simpl## y it is clear and high## light## s the most significant issue## s . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , the draft## ing of the Constitution is in line with the situ## ation which ha## s develop## ed historical## ly in modern @## -## @ day Europe and which current## ly exist## s in the world . 
ir## respect## ive of our will , global## isation process## es are occur## ring through## out the world , but initial## ly in good## s and capital move## ments , that is to say , in the real## m of material value## s . 
the exchange of spiritual and moral value## s is taking place far more slow## ly . 
I believ## e that one of the reason## s for conflict## s in man## y place## s through## out the world today is large## ly due to the great dis## proportion and im## balance between the global exchange of material and spiritual value## s . 
the new Constitution## al Treat## y is a step to## ward## s re## duc## ing this dis## proportion . 
this Treat## y will not on## ly help us understand more clear## ly who we are and where we are going , but will also provid## e great## er clar## ity to our partner## s through## out the world as to our aim## s and the value## s which guide our action## s . 
there## fore , I repeat that this Constitution is well time## d and necess## ary , de## spite certain short## coming## s . 
one s## uch short## coming , which Mr Po## ette## ring and other honour## able Member## s have al## read## y refer## red to , is that it contain## s no reference to Christ## ian value## s . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , we may or may not admit it , but we are Christ## ians , atheist## s , Mus## lim## s or of other faith## s . 
what we call common European value## s have evolve## d for cent## ur## ies and are bas## ed on Christ## ian value## s . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , all of us , including th## ose who have particip## ated in the draft## ing of the Constitution and th## ose who have particip## ated in the ana## lysis and discuss## ions , have an oblig## ation to explain the significance of this document to the citizen## s of our countries , as we can## not expect every European Union citizen to have read it . 
un## fortunate## ly I should like to warn again## st the trend seen in the Member State## s , where## by the Treat## y is often us## ed for short @## -## @ term discuss## ions on domestic policy . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , let us refrain from this tempt## ation and discourag## e our party member## s from do## ing like## wise . 
this is a long @## -## @ term document , which we , our child## ren and also our neighbour## s need . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I believ## e that today the Constitution## al Treat## y - the European Constitution - is be## coming a re## ality . 
the result of the Convent## ion &apos;## s work , on which we are to vot## e tomor## row , show## s the will to introduce more demo## cracy , trans## par## ency and efficiency in## to the European Institut## ions , strength## ening them and making the decision @## -## @ making process more efficient . 
the citizen## s are the real winner## s , since the Constitution consolidate## s our common value## s and principle## s . 
the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , which the European Union ha## s also publish## ed in mini## ature version - just like all of the most pre## cious book## s in histo## ry - ha## s be## en in## corporate## d in## to the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
in my opinion , this is a fundamental sign of the trans## par## ency , solid## arity and demo## cracy of right## s : the right## s of the individual , of child## ren , the elder## ly and dis## able## d people . 
this time these principle## s are be## ing adopt## ed precise## ly to bring our institution close## r to the people , to put it ami## d## st the people , s## o that we can provid## e the answer## s the## y particular## ly need precise## ly at this time . 
I there## fore think that re## mov## ing soci## ety &apos;## s bar## rier## s to ensu## re that citizen## s can particip## ate fully in our unit## ed Europe is the most import## ant aspect of our current activities . 
Mr President , the last thing I want to do is to spoil a party . 
over the next 48 hour## s this Parliament will spend hundred## s of thousand## s of euro on celeb## rating the Constitution . 
we s## hall have ball## oon## s , a las## er dis## play , an orchestra ; but I can## not help feel## ing that all this is a touch pre## mature . 
in at least ten countries there must be a refer## endum be## fore rat## ification . 
we can## not call the result of th## ose poll## s with certain## ty . 
not a s## ing## le ballot ha## s y## et be## en cast . 
if it we## re on## ly the party that was pre## mature , it would be ra## ther cur## mud## geo## n## ly of me to object , but we are anticip## ating the Constitution in other more import## ant ways . 
we are , for ex## ample , push## ing a## head with the creation of an EU diploma## tic service , a propos## al which , pend## ing formal rat## ification , ha## s no legal bas## is . 
in the field of justice and home affair## s we have gone even further , pre @## -## @ empt## ing man## y of the Constitution &apos;## s clause## s , in particular th## ose to do with the creation of a pan @## -## @ European legal system and a European public prosecu## tor . 
be## fore the Constitution had even be## en sign## ed , let al## one ratifi## ed , the European Court of Just## ice had indic## ated that it would treat the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s as justicia## ble . 
ask## ed formal## ly by this House what part## s of the Constitution the## y intend## ed to implement with## out wait## ing for official rat## ification , on## ly f## ive of the current Commission## ers answer## ed that it would be wrong to anticip## ate the result## s of the national refer## endum## s . 
the other 20 all re## plied in one way or an## other that the## y intend## ed to forge a## head at o## nce with## out wait## ing for the out## come of the national ballot## s . 
this is mean## t to be a democratic chamber , but it## s att## itude some## time## s recall## s Bert## ol## t Bre## cht &apos;## s famous coup## let &apos; Let us dismiss the people and elect an## other in the## ir place &apos; . 
I hope my country will vot## e &apos; no &apos; to the Constitution and I am campaign## ing to that end , but if I lose , I s## hall accept the result with good grace . 
I would urge th## ose of you who support the Constitution to dis## play a similar respect for the democratic process and not to try to implement large part## s of this Constitution even if one or more Member State## s ha## s vot## ed again## st it . 
no mean## s no . 
Mr President , Commission## er , I should like to start by address## ing the citizen## s of Europe , and urging them to care about the Constitution . 
we must do every## thing in our power to ensu## re that the European public accept## s this Constitution , be## cause it will make Europe clear## er and more citizen @## -## @ friend## ly , trans## parent and democratic . 
my impress## ion is that we are all in far too much of a hurry to get down to business as usual . 
the Constitution is on the table , but it ha## s not y## et be## en ratifi## ed . 
it is a political mile## stone for the European Union , and for a more citizen @## -## @ friend## ly , trans## parent and democratic European Union . 
s## o far , though , the Constitution ha## s be## en a PR disaster , and I should there## fore like to warn that we need an inform## ation and communic## ation plan for all the European institution## s , the Member State## s and the national parliament## s , and we need a European Constitution Week in all the Member State## s . 
we also need to abolish un## anim## ity in the Council , thu## s strength## ening the common , trans## parent and democratic Europe as provid## ed for in the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
I would call on the Head## s of State## s or Govern## ment to ensu## re that it is the spirit of the Convent## ion and of the sign## ing ceremony in Rome which set## s the tone of domestic political debate , and not a lack of critic## ism and discuss## ion , or aloof## ness and in## differ## ence . 
what we need is for the debate on the Constitution to be European## ised , not for the rat## ification process to be nationalise## d . 
the Constitution is not mer## e## ly a code of practice for the EU institution## s ; it affect## s all Europe &apos;## s citizen## s . 
we should how## ever be fully aware that work will begin a## fresh with tomor## row &apos;## s vot## e . 
all that this vot## e must there## fore do is to s## end out a clear signal . 
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Corbett and Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go , who re## ally have produce## d a master## piece , making the Constitution more read## able . 
the an## cient Roman juris## ts us## ed to say : &apos; &quot; ( the law arise## s out of the fact ) . 
well , from the first day that Europe &apos;## s found## ing father## s beg## an to dream , beg## an to imagin## e this common ent## ity - a s## ing## le ent## ity draw## ing together millennia of histo## ry , geo## graphy , soci## ety and common value## s - well , from that moment the found## ing father## s them## selves thought of having common rule## s : what we today call the Constitution . 
this is why I am extreme## ly disappoint## ed this morning to hear prominent fellow Member## s , who## s## e free## dom of express## ion I clear## ly respect , stating the## ir op## position to the draft Constitution . 
people may oppose this form of Constitution or the content of the Constitution## al Treat## y , but not common rule## s , since the establish## ment of these rule## s strength## ens sovereign## ty . 
today we have to reach an agree## ment in a world under## going fundamental change## s , including with regard to it## s system## s and new semantic## s : th## ose who## s## e idea of sovereign## ty is as it was conceiv## ed in the eigh## teenth and nineteen## th cent## ur## ies are mistake## n . 
today the new con## cept of sovereign## ty lies in subsid## i## arity : it is the sovereign## ty of local ident## ities , the sovereign## ty of citizen## s , the sovereign## ty of th## ose who must help construct a legal system to interpret in the best possible way the ever more vari## ed and complex need## s of an evolving soci## ety . 
we can## not conceiv## e of us## ing the termin## ology which the juris## ts taught us : federal state , con## federal state , sovereign state : Europe is a new ent## ity , a Union , precise## ly , with which we must all ident## ify . 
last## ly , I would like to express my regret at the lack of a reference , not just to our Christ## ian root## s , but also to Per## i## clean demo## cracy - the origin of the ver## y es## s## ence of demo## cracy - to the Roman Empire and to Carol## ing## ian Europe . 
let us hope that d## uring the process of European integration these thing## s will be re## member## ed . 
al## most 50 year## s after the sign## ing of the Treat## y of Rome , that establish## ed the European Eco## nomic Union , final## ly Europe is going to have it## s own constitut## ion . 
for the first time , 4## 50 million citizen## s and 20 nation## s are going to be unit## ed by this document that define## s the value## s and principle## s of this European Union . 
the rat## ification of this constitut## ion will lead us to a more democratic Europe . 
the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s was introduce## d in this constitut## ion and thu## s the right## s of e## ach person are list## ed and every citizen may invoke this charter when## ever he or s## he think## s that hi## s or her right## s have be## en broken . 
the social right## s are also a priorit## y and are s## o by a legal decree , the right to educ## ation , the right that every citizen can have access to inform## ation , protection in the case of an un## just exp## ulsion and the right that the re## quest## s for a review in the case of discrimin## ation on the bas## is of class can be sanction## ed , all have be## en define## d and can be implement## ed . 
the role of the European Parliament ha## s there## fore be## en great## ly strength## ened and the Parliament together with the Council is going to be respons## ible to rat## ify al## most all the document## s . 
the role of the national Parliament## s will be strength## ened as well , and this is be## cause it will be respons## ible to oversee that any agree## ment between the European Union and the Member State## s is respect## ed , and there## fore the national Parliament## s will have en## ough power to put pressure on the European Commission s## o that it can revise it## s propos## al## s . 
in other word## s , the European Constitution will help s## o that we can have a more efficient Europe . 
Europe , that ha## s be## en built in stag## es , and that is bas## ed on Treat## ies that have be## en agree## d upon a## long the year## s ; from now on## ward## s we will re## ally have one Europe . 
the integration of the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s , the clear recogn## ition of European value## s and object## ive## s are now giving us the opportun## ity , as European citizen## s , to call this document &apos; The European Constitution &apos; . 
I am going to vot## e in favour . 
I appeal my colleague## s to do like## wise for the good of European citizen## s . 
. 
Mr President , in respond## ing to this debate I wish to begin by thank## ing all th## ose who paid trib## ute to the work of the Committee on Constitution## al Affair## s and the report it produce## d . 
it is clear that this Constitution ha## s ver## y broad support a## cross the political spec## trum and a## cross Member State## s . 
I am hope## ful that in the vot## e tomor## row there will be at least a two @## -## @ thir## d## s major## ity in favour of it , with more th## an 4## 00 vot## es in favour in this Parliament , and that will s## end a power## ful signal . 
let me also respond to the critic## ism## s that have be## en ma## de of the Constitution . 
the## y seem to be two## fold . 
first## ly , there are th## ose who say the## y oppose the Constitution be## cause it does not go far en## ough . 
the## y say it will certain## ly make the EU more democratic , social and s## o on , but not en## ough s## o . 
my answer to them is that the cho## ice at the moment is between the new Constitution and the old one - our current Treat## ies . 
if the new Constitution contain## s improve## ments , th## en it is better to take the new Constitution ra## ther th## an carry on liv## ing with the old one . 
that is an argument I would also put to th## ose who complain that there is no reference to Christ## ian## ity in the new Constitution . 
there is no s## uch reference in the current Treat## ies , al## though the## y we## re draft## ed by Saint Schu## man . 
how## ever , the new Constitution contain## s a reference to our religious heritage and other heritage## s , and it## s value## s are Christ## ian value## s and also the value## s of man## y other## s . 
the## y are value## s that Christ## ians , non @## -## @ Christ## ians , people of other religio## ns and of no religio## n share . 
man## y opponent## s of this Constitution conjure up fear## s of a super## state ; man## y are oppose## d to the ver## y exist## ence of the European Union . 
that is illust## rated by th## ose who oppose the sup## rem## acy of Union law over the law of Member State## s , which is after all the current situ## ation . 
what is the point of agree## ing common law## s a## cross Europe if one does not want th## ose law## s to be appli## ed a## cross Europe ? 
that is the whole point of agree## ing common European legisl## ation in the area## s we want it , s## uch as the environment and the common market . 
there is no point in having that legisl## ation if you are again## st it in the first place . 
to th## ose people I would say : be honest and campaign for what you re## ally believ## e in , which is your country leav## ing the European Union , and do not hide be## hind attack## ing the Constitution . 
what non## sense to say that this new Constitution will creat## e a centralise## d super## state ! 
centralise## d , the European Union ? 
when it is bas## ed on a Constitution that confer## s power## s on the European Union with the agree## ment of every s## ing## le Member State on the rat## ification of treat## ies ? 
that is the on## ly power the Union ha## s . 
even in exerc## ising it## s power## s , the Council - i.e## . the Member State## s - ha## s a central role in taking decision## s , while the central administ## ration - the European Commission - ha## s few## er employ## ees th## an the C## ity of Leeds , in my constitue## ncy . 
some super## state ! 
let me conclude by say## ing that this debate is part## ly one of myth again## st re## ality . 
I am s## ure that by broadcast## ing the fact## s and en## ab## ling a tru## e ana## lysis of the Treat## y we will contribut## e to an honest debate which will persuade people that this Constitution is worth having . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , I should first## ly ver## y much like to thank Parliament for this construct## ive and large## ly posit## ive debate . 
I am able broad## ly to concur with what ha## s just be## en s## aid by one of the rapporteur## s concern## ing bo## th the qual## ity of this debate and the conclusion## s that must be drawn from it . 
more## over , it was this Parliament that instig## ated this constitutional process . 
as some## one point## ed out this morning , it was in this House that the constitutional process beg## an , and I should like to pay trib## ute , on be## half of the Presidency , to Altiero S## pin## elli who , with hi## s draft European Constitution of 19## 84 , initiate## d this process and set it going by introdu## c## ing a first s## tage , known as the S## ing## le Act , negotiate## d more## over under the Luxembourg Presidency . 
I should also like to say to th## ose who have attack## ed and criticise## d this draft Constitution that , in a democratic debate , we obvi## ously respect the## ir position . 
it is not , how## ever , with nineteen## th cent## ury dis## course## s that a vision is offer## ed to the people## s , European and other## s , of today &apos;## s twen## ty @## -## @ first cent## ury world . 
to turn in upon our## selves and return to out## mod## ed con## cept## s of sovereign## ty are in## adequate respons## es in a global## ised world . 
the## y offer no solution at all in term## s of prosper## ity , demo## cracy and peace , n## either to European## s nor to other## s . 
I should also like to say to th## ose who draw a subtle distinct## ion between a pro @## -## @ European &apos; no &quot; and an anti @## -## @ European &apos; no &quot; that there is on## ly a &apos; no &quot; pur## e and simpl## e , since a re## jection of the Constitution is simpl## y a defeat for Europe - a defeat for a strong## er , more open , more trans## parent and more democratic Europe with perspective## s to offer bo## th with## in and beyond it## s own border## s . 
I there## fore believ## e in the need not to become ent## angled in subtle## ties of this kind . 
admitted## ly , not every## thing is perfect in this Constitution , as the rapporteur s## aid . 
we should all have like## d to have seen improve## ments regard## ing this or that point . 
is not , how## ever , im## perfect## ion in a sense the ver## y es## s## ence of demo## cracy , since demo## cracy thriv## es on compromis## e ; and must we not there## fore be cap## able now of accept## ing a compromis## e that represent## s progress in order to make further progress in the futur## e ? 
as sever## al speaker## s have s## aid , the Constitution provid## es a sound bas## is for our share## d value## s . 
it sup## plies a democratic frame## work en## ab## ling the European Union to take more effective action where action is necess## ary , account having be## en take## n of the principle of subsid## i## arity . 
as ha## s be## en s## aid , the EU &apos;## s motto , &apos; Unit## ed in divers## ity &quot; character## ises the es## s## ence of this Europe . 
a balance between large and small Member State## s , equal## ity between citizen## s and the respect for national ident## ities mention## ed by sever## al speaker## s are the ver## y es## s## ence of our EU , reflect## ed ver## y well in this constitutional document . 
advance## s have be## en ma## de . the## y are per## hap## s in## sufficient . 
we should have like## d to have gone further in the Just## ice and Home Affair## s or external policy sphere## s , but I believ## e that the draft Constitution is an extreme## ly import## ant first s## tage . 
nor should re## vision## s be consider## ed just at this time . 
admitted## ly , every constitut## ion need## s to provid## e for re## vision mechan## ism## s , as this one does ; in fact , it provid## es for vari## ous type## s of mechan## ism . 
improve## ments will come as the year## s go by , on conditio## n that this Constitution is adopt## ed and that we are cap## able of app## ly## ing it and us## ing it to construct a genuine European demo## cracy . 
this document ha## s be## en prepar## ed with the broad particip## ation not on## ly of MEP## s and of parliament## arian## s and other represent## ative## s from the Member State## s but also of represent## ative## s of civil soci## ety . 
there ha## s be## en a debate , albeit an in## adequate one , in civil soci## ety . 
this debate must be encourag## ed and support## ed , particular## ly through the rat## ification procedure## s that , as ha## s be## en emphasis## ed , have al## read## y be## en complete## d in two countries and that are to begin in other countries too . 
in this respect , Article 1.4## 7 , re## l## ating to particip## atory demo## cracy , is an innov## ation , s## o much s## o that it is scarce## ly refer## red to in our national Constitution## s . 
it need## s to be br## ought al## ive and give## n practical content . 
the debate on the adopt## ion of the Constitution ha## s there## fore beg## un , and it must be extend## ed . 
citizen## s must be fully involve## d in it , whet## her or not there are refer## endum## s . 
I entire## ly agree with what the V## ice @## -## @ President of the Commission s## aid on the subject of communic## ation , ex## plan## ation and the ef## fort## s that must be ma## de in order to make Europe better under## stood . 
the Presidency concur## s with this assert## ion . 
I emphasis## e that this work must first## ly be done in the Member State## s , for it is there that the people are build## ing Europe . 
it require## s every## one &apos;## s involve## ment : first## ly , that of govern## ments and parliament## arian## s but also , I repeat , that of the represent## ative## s of civil soci## ety . 
in the course of the next few month## s , the Presidency will contribut## e every## where it can , and every## where it must , to this process and will encourag## e this debate . 
. 
Mr President , I would like to thank you all for this long but stimul## ating debate . 
the vast major## ity of the comment## s have right## ly paid trib## ute to this excel## lent report and to the work of the co @## -## @ rapporteur## s . 
hope## fully , it will receiv## e the overwhelm## ing support of this House tomor## row . 
I am conscious that this report and the Constitution need to be put in## to historical perspective . 
this is the first time that the European Parliament ha## s not had a list of regret## s about the result of an Inter## governmental Con## ference , and we can ask one of the veteran## s in this kind of work about this . 
if I compar## e this report to the Plan## as , Mén## dez de Vi## go and Tsatsos report## s , for ex## ample , it is the most posit## ive assess## ment of the out## come of an Inter## governmental Con## ference . 
I share the view## s of th## ose call## ing for a wide and honest debate . 
with## out debate we do not have a demo## cracy and , with## out debate , we do not get close## r to the truth . 
it is there## fore our respons## ibility to provid## e ex## ample## s of how the Constitution will affect the dai## ly live## s of European citizen## s . 
the word &apos; perfect &apos; ha## s be## en mention## ed . 
I have be## en a Commission## er for on## ly f## ive year## s and I have not y## et seen the &apos; perfect &apos; document . 
if you look a## round , how could we find a perfect document ? 
we will have to continu## e to compromis## e be## cause we are 25 Member State## s with different tradition## s , language## s , political decision @## -## @ making procedure## s and view## s . 
we will have to show the will and the cap## ability to compromis## e . 
this a compromis## e and it will have to be a compromis## e . 
the word## s us## ed this morning are worth recall## ing . 
most of them are political## ly load## ed - posit## ive## ly or negat## ive## ly . 
man## y have mention## ed right## s , demo## cracy , open## ness , effective## ness and value## s . 
Mr Mén## dez de Vi## go remind## ed us this morning that the Constitution is the un## ique opportun## ity to guarantee the value## s of the Union . 
we are unit## ed in our divers## ity but with a set of fundamental and social right## s that bring## s us together . 
these are the value## s we guarantee not just for us but for our child## ren . 
other## s have attempt## ed to describ## e the Constitution as result## ing in a European super## state , a los## s of national sovereign## ty , or a weaken## ing of the role of the national parliament## s . 
the## y have al## read## y receiv## ed a re## ply from Mr Corbett . 
while I expect that we should have to provid## e concrete fact## s and ex## ample## s of the benefit## s of the Constitution as compar## ed to the Treat## y of N## ice , I also expect that th## ose talk## ing about national sovereign## ty or national parliament## s should provid## e some fact## s . 
ha## s the role of national parliament## s be## en weaken## ed ? 
is it possible to sneak through a European law with## out super## vision by the Member State## s or national parliament## s ? 
we have to be able to respond to th## ose question## s . 
let us work on the bas## is of fact## s and the text of the Constitution . 
this should be ma## de access## ible to our citizen## s in all the Member State## s , not just s## care st## ories or mis## conception## s . 
we also have to ensu## re that we are read## y for the ent## ry in## to force of the Constitution when it is ratifi## ed by all Member State## s . 
we will should## er our respons## ibil## ities and s## o must the Member State## s . 
it is not en## ough to hope that adopt## ion in one Member State will lead to auto## matic accept## ance in the next country . 
that is why in the Council I have push## ed s## o strong## ly for proper national strate## gies to be develop## ed . 
as Mr Brok ha## s indic## ated , prepar## atory work ha## s al## read## y beg## un on the ent## ry in## to force of the Constitution and the European external action service that will assist the European Minister for Fo## reign Affair## s . 
we are not exact## ly jump## ing a## head , but we have to start to be prepar## ed . 
we can## not simpl## y wait and let an## other two year## s go by be## fore we can implement the provision## s . 
we will have to prepar## ed in the best possible way and find the right balance . 
I agree that we must ensu## re respect for the text of the Constitution . 
the speech## es this morning from Member## s in the new Member State## s have illust## rated the histo## ric value of the European project and the principle## s and value## s that it guarantee## s . 
whet## her we need a big## ger boat , a large## r bus or a large## r dress s## ize , we all recognis## e that we have a sense of respons## ibility . 
I look forward to join## ing you in that debate . 
the debate is closed . 
the vot## e will take place on Wednesday at 12 n## oon . 
the next item is the Commission communic## ation on the Green Pa## per on admiss## ion for employ## ment . 
Mr President , Mr Sch## mit , lad## ies and gentle## men , I have the honour of inform## ing Parliament that the Green Pa## per on economic migration that I present## ed follow## ing agree## ment with my colleague , Commission## er Sp## id## la , was adopt## ed today by the Col## lege . 
with this Green Pa## per , the Commission wish## es to make a contribut## ion to the current debate , a debate beg## un with the Tampere mandate concern## ing the most appropriate approach to the admiss## ion of economic migrants and concern## ing the add## ed value represent## ed by the adopt## ion of s## uch a common frame## work . 
with## in the frame## work of the programme devi## s## ed in The Ha## gue , the European Council invit## ed the Commission to present , be## fore the end of 20## 05 , a propos## al for a common European approach to legal im## migration for economic reason## s . 
three year## s ago , the Commission had address## ed a propos## al to the Council on this subject , but this was not follow## ed up be## cause of the re## luc## tance of sever## al Member State## s to tackle the problem in a Comm## un## ity perspective . 
the change## s on the international s## tage , Europe &apos;## s need for balance## d manage## ment of the migration phenomenon and of the latter &apos;## s man## y political , social and securit## y implic## ations and , final## ly , the sign## ing of the Constitution## al Treat## y - which make## s a clear distinct## ion between subject## s that fall with## in national compete## nce## s and th## ose which have , either in add## ition or exclus## ive## ly , a Comm## un## ity dimension - are factor## s that have led the Council to engage in time## ly reflect## ions and that have put this problem back on the age## nda . 
the strate## gy devi## s## ed in The Ha## gue define## s object## ive## s and establish## es a time## table that the Commission intend## s to respect . 
it is self @## -## @ evident that prepar## ing a propos## al in this area demand## s a wide , comprehens## ive and trans## parent debate and , above all , the particip## ation of institutional and social actor## s in carry## ing out the research for evalu## ations , propos## al## s and contribut## ions . 
in## de## ed , police force## s and the author## ities respons## ible for conduct## ing inquir## ies can## not have avail## able to them all of the fact## s necess## ary for put## ting together bo## th a picture of local situ## ations and of migr## atory flow## s from different region## s of the world to e## ach European country and a picture of the conditio## ns of integration that have al## read## y be## en met , or are to be promot## ed , for communit## ies of citizen## s from out## side the EU that al## read## y reside , or that are establish## ing them## selves , in the EU . 
in## de## ed , these factor## s give rise to the sense of in## securit## y experience## d by our fellow citizen## s and , in combat## ing them , we must not confine our## selves to react## ions in strict## ly milit## ary or pol## ic## ing term## s . 
on the contr## ary , political action## s also have to be under## take## n , begin## ning with a programme of initiative## s design## ed to manage the flow of grow## ing economic e## migration to## ward## s , inevit## ably , our own countries that some## time## s constitut## es an un## deni## able advantage for the European econom## y . 
final## ly , the public debate launch## ed by the Commission in the form of it## s Green Pa## per will en## able the Commission to collect a host of data and inform## ation that it will be able to use as a bas## is for prepar## ing the propos## al## s that are re## quest## ed from it by the Council and that we s## hall present with## in the period## s laid down . 
Mr President , listen## ing to Mr F## rat## tini , I was think## ing of the motto of the famous Belgian poet , Henri M## ich## aux , about n## ever despair## ing but allow## ing a solution to bubb## le up un## bidd## en . 
I do believ## e that we must pay trib## ute to the Commission for not having despair## ed but for having reopen## ed a necess## ary and use## ful debate . 
President Sch## mit , you should stay , for this is ver## y much your area . 
we are , in## de## ed , ver## y keen to see the Commission &apos;## s move bear fruit . 
you fail## ed on a pre## vi## ous attempt in this area , in spite of the Commission &apos;## s initiative and in spite of Parliament &apos;## s commit## ment . 
it was the Council that was un## able to bring about an agree## ment . 
the question I put to you , Mr F## rat## tini - y## es , it is to you that I am s## peak## ing - is this : what object## ive inform## ation do you have that lead## s you to think - and the question is , in truth , also address## ed to Mr Sch## mit - that the block## s plac## ed by the Council on the pre## vi## ous initiative are like## ly to be re## mov## ed today , a prospect about which we are , on the face of it , de## light## ed , albeit - it ha## s to be s## aid - s## light## ly sceptic## al . 
Commission## er , I am , of course , like my fellow MEP Mr Bou## rlanges , de## light## ed that the Commission and the European Parliament are continu## ing with the## ir common ef## fort## s to open legal im## migration channel## s . 
I should like , how## ever , to put three question## s to you , Commission## er . 
the first is similar to Mr Bou## rlanges &quot; question : what practical legisl## ative measure## s are you consider## ing taking , and what will you do to stop the Council block## ing s## uch measure## s , as in the case of your first attempt in 20## 01 ? 
the second question concern## s your propos## ed sector## al legisl## ation for legal im## migration . 
does not this approach endanger migrants &quot; right## s by creat## ing different regime## s for e## ach group ? 
t## hirdly and final## ly , what measure## s will you adopt in order to link this im## migration policy to a policy of European integration ? 
Mr President , my question## s follow on direct## ly from Mr## s Rou## re &apos;## s comment## s . 
first## ly , we welcome the fact that the Commission ha## s take## n the initiative on this matter , and I hope that , this time , the Council not again stand in it## s way . 
I believ## e that the European dimension of this task is more import## ant th## an the individual interest## s of the Member State## s ; this is why it is essential for us to adopt European rule## s , as with## out s## uch rule## s for this field we will be un## able to creat## e an internal market . 
one could , how## ever , be forgiv## en for wonder## ing at this point what the precise nature of these European rule## s will be . 
Mr F## rat## tini , I have notice## d that in your statement## s s## o far you have fail## ed to say that the key regulation## s which are al## read## y in force , s## uch as the ILO Convent## ion , will be take## n as a bas## is . 
what part will be play## ed in the Green Pa## per by the key issue## s refer## red to in the ILO Convent## ion on migr## ant workers ? 
in this connect## ion , I should like to note that the European Parliament ha## s al## read## y ask## ed the Commission to in## corporate these rule## s . 
Mr F## rat## tini , we have decide## d to divid## e the question## s in## to three , by group . 
do you wish , there## fore , to respond now to the statement## s ma## de by the three speaker## s ? 
. Mr President , I can answer the three question## s , which concern the same basic issue . 
I would like to thank Mr Bou## rlanges and the Member## s who took the floor . 
the first reason why I am reason## ably optim## istic over the possibil## ity of attain## ing a tang## ible result , name## ly the adopt## ion of a European initiative , is that , with regard to 20## 01 , it was the European Council - the ver## y institution which in 20## 01 di## d not allow a similar measure to be adopt## ed - which in N## ov## ember 20## 04 call## ed on the Commission to adopt a European initiative by the end of 20## 05 . 
with## in the frame## work of the Ha## gue Pro## gramme , the Head## s of State or Govern## ment , that is , th## ose at the high## est political level , ask## ed the Commission to go a## head and to do s## o quick## ly . 
that , in my view , demonst## rates a new aware## ness of the fact that on## ly Europe can provid## e the add## ed value for a strate## gy on legal im## migration . 
the second reason is that with respect to the past , we have cho## s## en what I would call a bottom @## -## @ up ra## ther th## an a top @## -## @ down approach . 
we have cho## s## en to launch a debate with Parliament , with the European Eco## nomic and Soci## al Committee , with employ## ers &quot; associ## ations and trade un## ions , s## o that we s## hall be read## y to put forward a propos## al on## ly o## nce we have gather## ed suggest## ions . 
I am confident that this method will first of all enhance the trans## par## ency of the debate , second## ly it will allow member## s of civil soci## ety to particip## ate more active## ly in this debate th## an in the past , and t## hirdly it will en## able Member State## s to approve or reject the propos## al that the Commission will table , having the view## s of the## ir employ## ers &quot; associ## ations , the## ir trade un## ions and the European Parliament on hand . 
these element## s will consolidate the work . 
I there## fore can## not predict what tang## ible measure## s will be include## d in the Commission &apos;## s initiative , precise## ly be## cause today we are re## launch## ing a European debate with the aim of gather## ing inform## ation and propos## al## s which we s## hall submit to a public hear## ing in about the middle of this year , s## o that we can table a propos## al by the end of 20## 05 . 
at that time we will be in a better position to understand what the tang## ible measure## s will be . 
I can on## ly tell you that we intend to adopt a frame## work of mini## mum rule## s , to en## able th## ose who wish to work legal## ly to do s## o , and at the same time to give people a pre## view of the provision## s with the mini## mum of bureau## cracy - there are current## ly 25 different rule## s on the admiss## ion of migr## ant workers , one per country . 
we intend to establish a European frame## work with which any## one out## side Europe can familiar## ise them## selves be## fore## hand : that will also help , in our opinion , to prevent illegal im## migration . 
Mr President , Commission## er , we feel that it is certain## ly commend## able that im## migrants are at last no long## er consider## ed a problem , but a resource - as the Green Pa## per express## ly states - and that we are aim## ing for a per## man## ent multi## cultural and multi## religious dia## logue . 
we are concern## ed , how## ever , by the product## ivity approach , as , more## over , you your## self call## ed it in an interview for an Italia## n news## paper : that is , the decision to make migr## atory flow## s conditional on the require## ments of the European labour market . 
the Green Pa## per incline## s to## ward## s the possibil## ity - just a possibil## ity , but one which we intend to comment on - of making the admiss## ion of an im## migr## ant conditional on a job vac## ancy which it ha## s not other## wise be## en possible to fill with European Union workers , or on a Member State &apos;## s specific need## s in particular employ## ment sector## s . 
Commission## er , do you not agree that application of this principle could mark the end of a common European im## migration policy , as well as a step back## ward## s from what man## y Member State## s have al## read## y achiev## ed ? 
Mr President , Commission## er , thank you for the Green Pa## per . 
since action was ur## gent## ly require## d , and s## till is , I am de## light## ed with it . 
I have on## ly just receiv## ed the Green Pa## per , and s## o I have not had the chance to read the whole document , on## ly the first few page## s . 
I was im## mediate## ly s## truck by some## thing on page 5 , where as regard## s the form of futur## e European legisl## ation with a view to the planned harmon## isation , three propos## al## s have be## en ma## de . 
at least , the impress## ion is creat## ed that three opt## ions are s## till open , name## ly the horizontal approach , the sector## al approach and the s## o @## -## @ call## ed common fast track procedure . 
is it not , though , the case that , thank## s to year## s of in## decision on the part of the Council , we have tacit## ly al## read## y decide## d in favour of the sector## al approach ? 
I think that the Pe## illo## n report about admit## ting thir## d @## -## @ country s## cient## ists and research## ers is a case in point . 
that is back## ed by the Council , and that may explain your optim## ism to some ex## tent . 
Mr President , Commission## er , man## y Member## s have not had sight of the Green Pa## per y## et , but at this ear## ly s## tage we should set down for you some basic principle## s of what is a ver## y welcome discuss## ion . 
first , as my colleague Mr## s Rou## re s## aid , integration policy must be a vital component of any propos## ed legisl## ation . 
we know that we want to share best practice , but we s## till have a ver## y vague position on integration policy . 
second## ly , manage## d migration mean## s all thing## s to all Member## s in this House . 
for some it may mean control , for some it may mean the right to fami## ly un## ity . 
this is a big gap and we must define in this discuss## ion what manage## d migration actual## ly mean## s . 
these are human be## ing## s coming from thir## d countries to work in the European Union , the## y are not commodit## ies . 
we will have a set of principle## s and law## s which will have to accommo## d## ate that . 
final## ly , I ver## y much welcome that civil soci## ety will have a much great## er say , but we must th## en listen to civil soci## ety , to the trade un## ions and to business . 
the## y have some good idea## s , and we must not just pay lip service to th## ose idea## s but creat## e a manage## d migration policy which will benefit bo## th the European Union and th## ose people and the## ir fami## lies who are coming to benefit our econom## ies . 
. Mr President , the three intervention## s allow me to formulate one s## ing## le comment . 
first## ly - and I am refer## ring in particular to Mr Fava , who al## read## y know## s this full well - a recognis## ed , common , wide## spread principle , common## ly refer## red to as the principle of pre## ference for Comm## un## ity workers over thir## d @## -## @ country workers , is not assert## ed for the first time , but mer## e## ly repeat## ed in the Constitution## al Treat## y of the European Union . 
precise## ly to avoid the in## discrimin## ate and un## balance## d application of this principle , we believ## e that we need to explore , with the help of civil soci## ety , trade un## ions and business## es , what job opportun## ities exist for which there is no direct issue of taking work away from the citizen## s of our countries . 
be## cause , if this we## re the issue , clear## ly the impact of im## migration on soci## ety would not be posit## ive , where## as we must ensu## re that legal im## migration lead## s to tru## e integration . 
this mean## s workers be## ing accept## ed in## to civil soci## ety and integrate## d in## to educ## ation , with real inclus## ion in soci## ety . 
obvi## ously , this matter is not address## ed by the Green Pa## per , but is the subject of integration poli## cies which will be the focus of a Commission action in 20## 05 . 
these are area## s that the Commission will be develop## ing this year , in close co## operation with Parliament and the Presidency . 
integration is an absolut## e## ly vital part of the process . 
in this for## um we seek in## stead to listen to suggest## ions as to how we can make European policy on the re## ception of thir## d @## -## @ country workers uniform : that is our aim . 
I would reiterate o## nce more to th## ose who ask## ed again that today I can## not give any opt## ions or pre## ference## s a## mong possible abstract solution## s . 
some## body ask## ed me whet## her we could introduce an American @## -## @ style green card . 
the answer## s will come from the public debate which will be start## ing , from Parliament and from the social actor## s to whom we s## hall listen . 
with regard to one point I will , of course , confirm a commit## ment which you can al## read## y guess : the Commission will not confine it## self to listen## ing to ad## vice , but will take in## to account the assess## ments and propos## al## s that it gather## s . 
in conclusion , there## fore , the Commission ha## s two line## s of action : turn## ing what ha## s until now be## en a national approach in## to a European approach , with the aim of promot## ing a more balance## d policy , and above all , delimit## ing the phenomenon of legal im## migration through a posit## ive approach with## in our soci## e## ties . 
this approach is essential for tru## e integration , which it will be difficult to achiev## e with## out it . 
Mr President , I thank the Commission for it## s initiative , which is extreme## ly welcome . 
let me try to put a new twist on thing## s . 
there are ten## s of million## s of European## s liv## ing out## side Europe who have benefit## ed from the im## migration policy of other countries - not on## ly the Unit## ed State## s , but also Australia , South Africa , New Ze## a## land and man## y other## s . 
these people - or a ver## y interest## ing s## ample of them - met for the first time d## uring the Greek preside## ncy in Ju## ne 20## 03 in Thessa## loniki . 
some of the most remark## ably success## ful Italia## ns , Greek## s , Czech## s , Roman## ians and other## s liv## ing a## round the world came to tell us about the## ir experience## s . 
the## ir experience , as European citizen## s , of be## ing integrate## d in## to th## ose countries could be extreme## ly helpful to you , Commission## er . 
I was involve## d in this and I would be happy to help your staff plan a meet## ing with these people . 
I do not believ## e that any of us here feel that the relativ## es we have in thir## d countries have harm## ed th## ose countries , nor do the host countries feel that the## y have harm## ed them . 
s## o for us as European## s to fear the not## ion of legal migration s## o great## ly go## es again## st our personal experience## s . 
let us hear the experience## s of these people . 
the## ir experience## s might even en## able us to make it easi## er for our own citizen## s - ident## ifying as the## y will with them - to understand the benefit## s of legal migration to Europe . 
I have an observ## ation to make , or ra## ther a question to ask of Commission## er F## rat## tini . 
I am not familiar with the Green Pa## per , but I would like this document to contain provision## s to ensu## re that in futur## e Europe will not be suspect## ed or accus## ed , as ha## s some## time## s be## en the case with the Unit## ed State## s , of cau## s## ing a &apos; brain drain &quot; from poor countries . 
we need to make s## ure that people who come to European univers## ities or scientific institute## s to stu## dy or train do not remain here for what## ever reason## s , whet## her work## ing or not , as this represent## s a los## s for the## ir own countries . 
the countries affect## ed are frequent## ly poor countries , who## s## e development depend## s to a large ex## tent on the educ## ation of s## uch an elit## e . 
a policy must be develop## ed which ens## ures that on the one hand it is possible to work here for a certain length of time , but that on the other hand instrument## s also exist which would not s## o much force people to return as encourag## e them to do s## o , in order to put the knowledge and experience the## y have gain## ed to use in develop## ing the## ir own culture## s and soci## e## ties . 
Mr President , I have a sense of here , having draft## ed the opinion of the Committee on Em## ploy## ment and Soci## al Affair## s on a number of these issue## s . 
I have a number of question## s . 
what attention is going to be paid to the work that Parliament ha## s al## read## y done on these issue## s ? 
we have put forward a consider## able number of propos## al## s , which we discuss## ed with civil soci## ety , trade un## ions and business . 
the trade un## ions will demand par## ity of treat## ment for thir## d country national## s coming to work in the European Union , s## o that the## y are not paid poor## ly to under## cut workers here . 
business people will tell you that the## y want ent## ry ma## de easi## er s## o that the## y are not acting as a parallel im## migration system . 
one of the thing## s that have change## d since Parliament last look## ed at this is that we now have ten new Member State## s . 
if we are look## ing at a hiera## rchy of move## ment for employ## ment , presum## ably the Commission is look## ing at re## mov## ing the transit## ion period## s for th## ose new Member State## s as part of that change in the hierarchical system of ent## ry for employ## ment . 
Mr President , I am particular## ly keen to pick up on Mr## s Lamb## ert &apos;## s comment## s on transit## ion period## s . 
we should do our best to avoid perpetu## ating the absurd situ## ation where## by thir## d @## -## @ country national## s are invit## ed to work in the European Union or in the European labour market whi## lst restrict## ions on employ## ment opportun## ities for th## ose from EU Member State## s are s## till in place . 
a balance of some kind must be found , and I am confident that this will become possible in the course of further work on the matter . 
I would how## ever like to thank Commission## er F## rat## tini and hi## s staff for the## ir ef## fort## s in continu## ing work on this issue , above all be## cause employ## ment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizen## s , as ha## s be## en br## ought to my attention in man## y convers## ations with group## s and individual## s affect## ed . 
on a s## light## ly different note , I have notice## d that the Green Pa## per is litter## ed with a great man## y question## s . 
give## n that the issue of labour migration is s## uch a complex one , it would per## hap## s be better to leave some of these to one side , in line with the principle of &apos; keep it simpl## e , stupid . &quot; 
. I thank all Member## s of Parliament for the## ir suggest## ions and opinion## s . 
the fundamental purpose of this propos## al is that legal migration should be seen not as a problem but as an opportun## ity for all of us and for Europe in particular . 
in this period we will launch a public debate . 
we will take in## to account the work al## read## y done by Parliament , particular## ly on equal## ity of right## s and opportun## ities for legal migrants . 
we will take in## to account suggest## ions , concrete propos## al## s , and we will consider all propos## al## s as a ver## y posit## ive contribut## ion in the spirit of open and frank co## operation . 
I should like to mention the import## ant issue of &apos; brain drain &apos; . 
this issue of brain drain and what to do about it will be one of the key subject## s in the particular and specific communic## ation on migration and development , which the Commission will present in Spring 20## 05 . 
I can al## read## y assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the acute## ness of this problem , particular## ly in specific countries and sector## s s## uch as health## care . 
the Commission intend## s to propos## e a tailor @## -## @ ma## de approach where respons## es could be ma## de that are comm## ensu## rate with the magn## itude of this ver## y import## ant and sensitiv## e problem . 
in this way , we will put emphasis on the posit## ive impact that migration can have on countries of origin . 
final## ly , I can assure you that this problem will be take## n fully in## to account by the Commission . 
that conclude## s the item on the Commission communic## ation on the Green Pa## per on admiss## ion for employ## ment . 
I should like to thank Commission## er F## rat## tini and the speaker## s . 
Mr Ortuondo Larrea ha## s ask## ed to be give## n the floor in order to make a personal statement . 
Mr President , if I had to define the spirit of the Constitution## al Treat## y , I would say , first## ly , that it is integration## ist ; second## ly , that it is bas## ed on free access## ion ; t## hirdly , that it is respect## ful of different ident## ities , culture## s , language## s and institutional structure## s and creat## es a European citizen## ship which does not exclude , but ra## ther co @## -## @ exist## s with , other citizen## s from the Member countries . 
in the Bas## que country , our Parliament ha## s just approve## d , by an absolut## e major## ity , a new Stat## ute for co @## -## @ exist## ence with the S## pan## ish State which , in fact , is inspir## ed by the Comm## un## ity model , which maintain## s these same principle## s I have indic## ated and is respect## ful of the Constitution## al Treat## y . 
n## ever## the## less , in this morning &apos;## s debate one Member ha## s accus## ed it of attack## ing the European Constitution and ha## s s## aid that the Bas## que President and the Bas## que Nation## alist Part## y have alli## ed them## selves with the en## emi## es of Europe . 
that is entire## ly false . 
we are going to support a &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e and we advoc## ate a &apos; y## es &quot; to the Treat## y establish## ing a Constitution for Europe in the coming refer## endum . 
and we want to be able to live together in peace and friend## ship with the other people## s of the S## pan## ish State , on the bas## is of mutual respect for different ident## ities and language## s , free access## ion and common work with## in a unit## ed Europe . 
we Bas## que## s have support## ed European integration from the out## set , and we want to be more European and are work## ing for a common futur## e with all European## s under the new Constitution## al Treat## y . 
the next item is Que## s## tion Time , with question## s to the Commission ( B## 6 @## -## @ 00## 01 / 20## 05 ) . 
as a result of the propos## al adopt## ed by the Commission on 26 October , text## ile import quota## s are going to be abolish## ed from 1 Janu## ary 20## 05 . 
in term## s of industrial re## structuring and employ## ment , this decision is going to have ver## y major con## sequenc## es for some of the Union &apos;## s region## s . 
econom## ists in the Nord @## -## @ Pa## s @## -## @ de @## -## @ Ca## lais region are al## read## y s## peak## ing about the los## s of 9 000 of the 29 000 direct job## s in the text## ile indus## try in that area . 
a veri## table human trage## dy await## s the workers concern## ed and the## ir fami## lies . 
what specific aid measure## s is the Commission going to take to safeguard and develop employ## ment in the EU &apos;## s major text## ile indus## try region## s , particular## ly in term## s of structural fund## ing and combat## ing intra## - and extra @## -## @ European re## location process## es ? 
honour## able Member## s , I am respond## ing to this question on be## half of my colleague , Mr Mand## el## son , who is un## able to be here today as he is current## ly on hi## s way to In## dia . 
the W## TO Agreement on Tex## tile and Clo## thing , which establish## ed a ten @## -## @ year period for the elimi## nation of the quota## s , expir## ed on 31 Dec## ember 20## 04 , and trade in text## ile and cloth## ing product## s is hence## forth subject to the general W## TO rule## s . 
quota remo## val is like## ly to re## shape the export of text## ile and cloth## ing and global out## sourcing trend## s . 
there may be a substitution effect a## mong supplier## s to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of product## s , econom## ies of scale , competitive price## s and efficient service## s . 
the impact of abolish## ing quota## s will in## de## ed be consider## able , though it is difficult to assess at this s## tage . 
more## over , it is like## ly to vary great## ly depend## ing on country conditio## ns , the ability to achiev## e competitive advantage## s in the high## er value add## ed production segment and domestic policy respons## es . 
sustain## ed ef## fort## s are need## ed to help upgrad## e the s## kill level## s of workers , improve the qual## ity of the## ir job## s and empower social partner## s at all level## s to address the man## y challenge## s in the sector . 
as far as Europe is concern## ed , this sector definite## ly ha## s asset## s for the futur## e . 
invest## ment , a move up## market and world leader## ship in the fashion indus## try have ma## de Europe the world &apos;## s big## gest export## er of text## ile## s and it## s second big## gest export## er of cloth## ing . 
the Commission believ## es that this entail## s a three @## -## @ prong## ed respons## e : monitor the level of import## s in## to the EU , help the sector strength## en it## s competitive## ness and remain a key indus## try in the EU , and keep a special focus on the poor## est and more vulner## able develop## ing countries . 
the Commission communic## ation of 13 October 20## 04 , entitle## d &apos; Tex## tile## s and Clo## thing after 20## 05 &apos; , is a key element of this strate## gy . 
this communic## ation was a respons## e to the set of re## commend## ations by the High Lev## el Group on Tex## tile## s and Clo## thing , in which trade un## ions we## re represent## ed . 
on structural fund## ing and re## location process## es , the particip## ation of the text## ile and cloth## ing sector in multi## sector## al programme## s should provid## e an efficient frame## work for support## ing the sector , allow for divers## ification of production and ultimate## ly serve the economic interest## s of the region## s in question . 
in add## ition , the Commission propos## es that in all futur## e programme## s , Member State## s should reserv## e an amount of 1 % of the Struct## ural Fund &apos;## s annual contribut## ion for the &apos; Converg## ence &apos; object## ive and 3 % of the Struct## ural Fund &apos;## s annual contribut## ion for the &apos; Region## al competitive## ness and employ## ment &apos; object## ive , to cover un## foresee## n local or sector## al cris## es link## ed to economic and social re## structuring or to the con## sequenc## es of trade open## ing . 
Madam President , allow me to express to this House my heart## felt solid## arity with the million## s of employ## ees who will see the## ir live## s shatter## ed in the interest## s of satisf## y## ing , o## nce again , a minor## ity of af## fluent people . 
in## de## ed , the econom## ists of the Inter## national Fede## ration of Trade Union## s talk of what the## y , if not the Commission , know will be the destruct## ion of thir## ty million job## s , a million of them in Europe , North Africa , S## ri Lanka and Indonesia . 
as if what a number of these countries have just experience## d we## re not en## ough , the## y now find them## selves in even deep## er trouble . 
it is , I strong## ly emphasis## e , the Commission &apos;## s , the Council &apos;## s and Parliament &apos;## s respons## ibility and du## ty to put a stop to this social disaster . 
the Commission must be aware of the problem of force## d and illegal child labour in the cocoa indus## try . 
West Africa provid## es most of the world &apos;## s cocoa , where over 200 000 child## ren are thought to be work## ing in hazard## ous conditio## ns on cocoa farm## s ( Inter## national Institut## e of Tropic## al Agri## culture , Ju## ly 20## 02 ) . 
European consum## ers are fac## ed with the possibil## ity that some of the chocolate the## y eat ha## s be## en produce## d by force## d labour . 
could the Commission inform me of what initiative## s it ha## s under## take## n to ensu## re that the taste of slav## ery is irradi## c## ated from the European diet ? 
. 
honour## able Member## s , I am respond## ing to this question on be## half of my colleague , Mr Michel , who is un## able to be here this afternoon , as he must attend the don## ors &apos; conference on the ts## un## ami disaster . 
on this issue , the approach of the Commission is two## fold . 
first## ly , on the one hand , we support the initiative## s and programme## s of the ILO . 
second## ly , we reinforce the capacity of the countries in the region to implement the relev## ant Cotonou provision## s and different Eco## nomic Comm## un## ity of West Africa## n State## s protocol## s and initiative## s in the area of child protection . 
the Inter## national Lab## our Organ## isation , through it## s Inter## national Pro## gramme on the Elimin## ation of Child Lab## our , launch## ed in 20## 00 a new initiative call## ed &apos; Com## bat## ing Traffic## king in Child## ren for Lab## our Expl## oit## ation in West and C## ent## ral Africa &apos; . 
in 20## 03 a &apos; West Africa Cocoa / Com## merci## al Agri## cultural Pro## gramme to Com## bat Haz## ard## ous and Expl## oit## ative Child Lab## our &apos; was add## ed , focus## ing in particular on cocoa farm## ing . 
the Commission ha## s a strategic partner## ship with the ILO , in which the fight again## st child labour is a priorit## y . 
in that con## text , a programme of EUR 15 million under the AC## P fund## s is current## ly under consider## ation . 
the object## ive## s would be , , first## ly , to establish a sustain## able mechan## ism to prevent child## ren from carry## ing out all sort## s of labour in the agri## cultural and other sector## s . 
second## ly , to strength## en the capacity of national and communit## y @## -## @ level age## ncies and organisation## s in plan## ning , initi## ating , implement## ing and evalu## ating action to prevent and progress## ive## ly eliminate child labour . 
t## hirdly , to re## move all child## ren involve## d in work in the cocoa sector , to prevent child## ren at risk from enter## ing s## uch work , and to improve the in## come @## -## @ earn## ing capacity of adult fami## ly member## s , particular## ly women , through social protection schem## es . 
ECO## WA## S is active as a regional organisation in the fight again## st child labour . 
in add## ition to the Cotonou provision## s on trade and labour standard## s , the ECO## WA## S Head## s of State have adopt## ed a decla## ration and a plan of action to fight child exploit## ation , and ECO## WA## S ha## s re## cent## ly set up a child unit in it## s secretariat . 
the 9## th ED## F Region## al Indic## ative Pro## gramme will provid## e capacity @## -## @ build## ing to this new unit with## in ECO## WA## S , with a view to promot## ing the effective## ness of it## s work . 
I thank the Commission## er for giving me inform## ation on the ILO and vari## ous other organisation## s and activity which is al## read## y in the public do## main . 
I wonder whet## her the Commission is actual## ly consider## ing a more posit## ive age## nda with regard to comp## an## ies who are making profit## s out of this at the moment , by per## hap## s insist## ing that un## less European comp## an## ies - and do not forget that European## s and North American## s consum## e most of these cocoa product## s - can give a guarantee that the## y are not making the## ir product## s and profit## s on the back of child labour , th## en the## y can## not import them in## to Europe . 
ha## s the Commission consider## ed that and will the Commission consider it ? 
. the Commission believ## es that the frame## work of the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the 77 AC## P countries give## s real opportun## ities to address the human and social aspect## s of this practice , as well as the corrupt## ion element that may be link## ed to it , through political dia## logue and support for good govern## ance in AC## P countries . 
more## over , it consider## s that p## over## ty and the lack of local opportun## ities are a## mong## st the main reason## s for exploit## ative child labour and child traffick## ing . 
the p## over## ty## - reduction approach through EU development co## operation is a sound bas## is for tack## ling the problem as it give## s priorit## y to equi## table grow## th and to better access to educ## ation . 
final## ly , the Cotonou Agreement represent## s an import## ant step forward in promot## ing CL## S in bilateral agree## ments . 
Article 50 include## s a specific provision on trade and labour standard## s , which re## affirm## s the commit## ments of the Parti## es to international CL## S as define## d by the relev## ant ILO Convent## ions . 
is the Commission aware of the fact that the world C## ho## col## ate Manu## fact## urer## s Associ## ation conclude## d an agree## ment back in 20## 01 specific## ally to deal with this issue ? 
would the Commission there## fore under## take to look at the report that is due in the middle of this year from the international chocolate manufacture## rs , commend them on the work that the## y have be## en do## ing and encourag## e them to continu## e to develop the## ir cert## ification programme ? 
I am at a los## s as to why chocolate ha## s be## en s## ing## led out in this respect be## cause there are man## y other food product## s be## ing source## d from Third World countries where the same issue## s pertain - label## ling issue## s and qual## ity standard## s are ver## y import## ant a## cross the whole of the sector . 
. 
I will certain## ly bring Mr Harb## our &apos;## s comment## s to Mr Michel &apos;## s attention . 
I propos## e that the Commission im## mediate## ly commence talk## s with the Russia## n Fede## ration on the threat of a suspens## ion of and ra## ising bar## rier## s again## st food export## s to Russia from Po## land and other new Member State## s . 
these talk## s should help facilit## ate , normal## ise , accele## rate and define the inspect## ion crite## ria . 
I wish to express my in## dign## ation at the Commission &apos;## s stated position that the issue of vet## er## in## ary inspect## ions by the Russia## n Fede## ration is an internal matter for the above states . 
this statement smack## s of discrimin## ation again## st the new Member State## s in EU internal relation## s , be## cause Member State## s do not have the power to make in## dependent decision## s regard## ing vet## er## in## ary matter## s relate## d to the import of product## s from thir## d countries . 
hence , it will be im## possible to resolv## e the problem with## out dia## logue between all the part## ies . 
this situ## ation is not new to the Commission , as it ha## s al## read## y &apos; support## ed &apos; talk## s between France and the Unit## ed State## s on a similar matter . 
. I am respond## ing to this question on be## half of my colleague , Mr Kyprianou , who is un## able to be here today , as he is un## well . 
the Commission ha## s ma## de all reason## able ef## fort## s to avoid disrupt## ion in export## s of anim## al and plant product## s from the European Union to Russia . 
this potent## ial disrupt## ion arise## s from Russia## n insist## ence that EU export## s meet it## s specific import require## ments . 
for anim## al product## s , there was the concrete concern that trade would be total## ly block## ed from 1 Janu## ary 20## 05 . 
from this d## ate , in fact , Russia insist## s on a s## ing## le set of sanit## ary certifi## cate## s for import## s . 
how## ever , negoti## ations led by the Commission on be## half of the EU have avert## ed this risk . 
as regard## s plant product## s , where a similar risk to export## s could material## ise from 1 April 20## 05 , the Commission intend## ed to start negoti## ations as s## oon as the risk emerge## d , and ask## ed the Council to endorse this . 
follow## ing a debate a## mong Member State## s on the bas## is of this re## quest , the AG## RI Council in Dec## ember 20## 04 agree## d and the Commission im## mediate## ly start## ed negoti## ations on these issue## s on be## half of the EU . 
the Commission is confident that this will lead to a success## ful out## come . 
the honour## able Member can be assure## d , there## fore , that al## though the Commission ha## s ver## y li## ttle compete## nce in relation to export require## ments in thir## d countries , it ha## s express## ed it## s will## ing## ness and ha## s be## en pro## active in view of help## ing to solv## e this kind of problem and , as s## oon as the Commission was give## n the green light from the Council , it engage## d in time## ly negoti## ations . 
in the course of negoti## ations , no distinct## ion ha## s be## en ma## de between the new and former Member State## s . 
how## ever , Russia ha## s insist## ed on inspect## ing all establish## ments in the new Member State## s which have re## quest## ed approval for export . 
the Commission ha## s high## light## ed that these same establish## ments have be## en approve## d for intra @## -## @ EU trade follow## ing the enlarge## ment process . 
it ha## s also press## ed for the inspect## ion process to be car## ried out as quick## ly as possible . 
over## all , this situ## ation ha## s un## doubt## ed## ly led to disrupt## ion in the trade of these Member State## s with Russia , and it is not ma## de easi## er by the fact that Russia is not a member of the W## TO and does not there## fore consider it## self bound by the rule## s of the W## TO . 
the honour## able Member may rest assure## d that the Commission ha## s involve## d all Member State## s in the ef## fort## s to avoid trade disrupt## ion , in particular the new Member State## s . 
these ef## fort## s are continu## ing and the Commission will continu## e to defend the Comm## un## ity interest . 
Madam President , Commission## er , the situ## ation is more dramat## ic th## an might be suppose## d from the Commission## er &apos;## s re## ply . 
since 1 May , Russia ha## s be## en play## ing game## s and not accept## ing good## s from Po## land in retali## ation for the refusal by certain countries , s## uch as the Baltic countries , to accept Russia## n import## s be## cause the## y fail## ed to meet the sanit## ary require## ments laid down by the EU . 
Member State## s do not , how## ever , have the power to take in## dependent decision## s on vet## er## in## ary matter## s re## l## ating to import## s of product## s from thir## d countries . 
I would ask you to take ur## gent action on this matter . 
. 
as I stated in my re## ply , the Commission ha## s treat## ed this matter with consider## able urge## ncy , when we ask## ed the Council to give us the go @## -## @ a## head and when we engage## d in negoti## ations . 
the honour## able Member is correct that it impose## s certain major difficult## ies on some of these countries and the Commission will do it## s ver## y best to achiev## e a satisfactory solution . 
how## ever , I must stress the limit## s of what we can achiev## e . 
hope## fully , with good## will on all side## s , the matter can be br## ought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near futur## e . 
there is wide## spread concern that the draft Service## s Direct## ive , particular## ly it## s &apos; country of origin &apos; provision , may lead to social dump## ing and a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; in service provision . 
will the Commission now withdraw the draft direct## ive and initiate a process of consult## ation aim## ed at pro## duc## ing a more balance## d propos## al , while also taking in## to account the need for a Framework Direct## ive to en## able deliver## y of high @## -## @ qual## ity service## s of general interest / public service## s ? 
. 
the Commission wish## es to stress that re## mov## ing internal market bar## rier## s is not tant## amount to under## min## ing the qual## ity of service## s , or that the Service## s Direct## ive will lead to social dump## ing - quit## e the contr## ary . 
as regard## s the protection of workers , the propos## ed direct## ive does not affect the exist## ing Comm## un## ity , name## ly the Post## ed Work## ers &quot; Direct## ive from 19## 96 . 
this direct## ive provid## es that post## ed workers , including tempo## rary workers , enjoy , ir## respect## ive of the law appli## cable to the employ## ment relation## ship , a number of import## ant protect## ive provision## s concern## ing work## ing conditio## ns in force in the Member State where the work## er is post## ed . 
there## fore , comp## an## ies can## not use this propos## al in order to establish them## selves in low @## -## @ wage countries to circumvent the social protection of the host Member State . 
in add## ition , the propos## ed direct## ive reinforce## s the control of post## ed workers be## cause it establish## es a system of co## operation between Member State## s and oblig## es the country of origin of the service provid## er to assist the author## ities of the host Member State in the super## vision of work## ing conditio## ns . 
the propos## ed direct## ive will thu## s help to prevent social dump## ing . 
the Commission does not share the concern that the direct## ive will lead to a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; in service provision . 
first , the country of origin principle on## ly appli## es to the tempo## rary cross @## -## @ border provision of service## s . 
for service## s provid## ed via an establish## ment in an## other Member State - for ex## ample a hospital or a home for the elder## ly - the service provid## er will have to comp## ly with all the relev## ant rule## s in that Member State . 
second , the country of origin principle is embed## d## ed in harmon## isation and enhance## d administ## rative co## operation between Member State## s . 
more## over , a number of derog## ations from the country of origin principle cover , for in## stance , the appli## cable work## ing conditio## ns in the con## text of post## ing of workers , consum## er contra## cts , health and safety on build## ing s## ites and public health . 
final## ly , the Commission wish## es to stress that the propos## ed direct## ive does not require the liberal## isation or privat## isation of service## s which are current## ly provid## ed at national , regional or local level by the public sector or public ent## ities . 
n## either does the propos## al affect the free## dom of the Member State## s to define what the## y consider to be service## s of general economic interest and how the## y should be organise## d or financ## ed . 
further## more , it does not affect Member State## s &apos; ability to maintain appropriate regulation## s concern## ing the qual## ity , avail## ability and perform## ance of service## s of general interest , or other regulation## s ens## uring consum## er and us## er right## s . 
it is also import## ant to note that the propos## al does not pre## judge the work on , or the out## come of , specific Comm## un## ity initiative## s , in particular the follow @## -## @ up to the Whi## te Pa## per on service## s of general interest . 
the Commission ha## s commit## ted to a genuine dia## logue with bo## th co @## -## @ legisl## ators and interest## ed part## ies with a view to find## ing solution## s to specific area## s of concern . 
to d## ate , the need for a major step forward in open## ing the internal market ha## s not y## et be## en valid## ly contest## ed . 
I am confident that also the honour## able Member would like to see comp## an## ies , consum## ers and workers enjoy the benefit## s of an open and competitive integrate## d service## s market . 
we are all aware of the economic and social challenge## s fac## ing the European Union . 
bear## ing in mind the import## ance of the service## s sector , the propos## ed direct## ive will contribut## e significant## ly to address## ing these challenge## s . 
first## ly I would like to welcome the Commission## er to hi## s first Que## s## tion Time in Parliament . 
I look forward to more . 
I am a li## ttle bewilder## ed by the Commission## er &apos;## s re## ply . 
hi## s re## ply indic## ate## s that this direct## ive will do nothing , that it is not going to affect any of the area## s about which we have express## ed concern . 
he say## s it will on## ly app## ly to tempo## rary cross @## -## @ border provision of service## s . 
in what way , th## en , will this direct## ive lead to a competitive integrate## d service## s market ? 
if it is simpl## y to provid## e for the provision of tempo## rary cross @## -## @ border provision## s , how does it lead to a competitive integrate## d service## s market ? 
. 
as I point## ed out in my re## ply , the country of origin principle appli## es on## ly to the tempo## rary cross @## -## @ border provision of service## s . 
the rest of the direct## ive deal## s with any other area## s . 
if service## s are provid## ed via an establish## ment in an## other Member State , the service provid## er will have to comp## ly with all the relev## ant rule## s in that Member State . 
I should like to point out to the honour## able Member that I would accept that the Service## s Direct## ive is ver## y ambitious : it aim## s to provid## e an over## arch## ing frame## work . 
I am aware of the concern## s of man## y Member## s of this Parliament and people out## side this Parliament . 
I am ver## y conscious that it ha## s ra## ised the political temper## ature in a number of Member State## s . 
I have enter## ed in## to an open and construct## ive dia## logue with Member## s , and I will continu## e to do that . 
I look forward to futur## e communic## ations from your rapporteur to assess parliament## arian## s &apos; view## s with## in the committee respons## ible . 
would the Commission## er agree that it is vital## ly import## ant for Member## s of this House to understand the huge varie## ty of discrimin## atory and anti @## -## @ competitive practice## s that Member State## s current## ly app## ly again## st service provid## ers ? 
it would be ver## y helpful if you could explain these in more detail to Member## s of this Parliament who persist in describ## ing this direct## ive in the entire## ly un## just## ified term## s you have s## o convincing## ly dismiss## ed in your answer of &apos; social dump## ing &apos; and a &apos; race to the bottom &apos; . 
there is no evidence what## soever that either of th## ose thing## s will happen , and it would be helpful if the job creation facet inherent in this direct## ive we## re proper## ly communic## ated . 
. 
I certain## ly agree with the honour## able Member that the opportun## ities for job creation from an open## ing @## -## @ up of the service## s market through## out Europe are immens## e . 
vari## ous stu## dies have be## en initiate## d , and there are great opportun## ities for job creation . 
give## n that service## s account for well over 60 % of the Union &apos;## s G## DP , it is clear that any improve## ment in the service## s area is going to lead to an increas## e in wealth and job## s for people in the Union . 
I agree with the honour## able Member that man## y anti @## -## @ competitive practice## s exist in lot## s of Member State## s that prevent the real open## ing @## -## @ up of the service## s market . 
the service## s direct## ive is attempt## ing to open up the service## s area to the benefit of every## body in Europe . 
but having s## aid that , and in re## ply to the ear## lier question from Mr De Ross## a , I am also conscious of the specific concern## s express## ed by Member## s . 
hope## fully , d## uring the parliament## ary process and other process## es we will be able to tease these concern## s out further . 
if you take the qual## ification## s that the Commission## er express## ed in hi## s answer to the first question at face value , it is clear that this direct## ive would not app## ly to the UK health service , which is bas## ed on care that is free at the point of use . 
if we can take hi## s re## assurance## s at face value , why does he not simpl## y exclude health from the s## cope of this direct## ive ? 
. 
the approach that I have adopt## ed with the European Parliament and other## s who have ra## ised concern## s is to have th## ose concern## s and problem## s put on the table and in## to a document . 
I would not wish to start with a list of the item## s I think should be re## mov## ed . 
that would not be the correct approach . 
I accept that this is a ver## y ambitious document , what we are try## ing to achiev## e is worth fight## ing for . 
people come to vari## ous issue## s in this House from vari## ous perspective## s , with the## ir own experience## s and political and economic philosoph## ies . 
what we all have to accept is that if Europe is to meet the challenge## s of the futur## e and keep the social protection model and other thing## s that we aspi## re to and want in Europe , we have to ensu## re that the European econom## y grow## s . 
standing s## till is not an opt## ion . 
the Service## s Direct## ive attempt## s to open up this particular market . 
as I point## ed out in re## ply to Mr Harb## our , service## s make up the bulk of the European Union &apos;## s economic activity , there## fore it is a go## al well worth fight## ing for . 
in ear## ly 20## 04 , the European Commission present## ed a propos## al for a direct## ive on service## s as a cruc## ial contribut## ion to the pur## suit of the Lisbon Strategy . 
this propos## al ha## s provok## ed a great deal of debate , including strong support as well as fierce op## position from some quarter## s . 
what conclusion## s does the Commission draw from the react## ions that the propos## al ha## s generate## d ? 
could the Commission indic## ate why it ha## s cho## s## en to table a propos## al with s## uch a broad s## cope and why it is put## ting s## o much emphasis on the role of the country of establish## ment of the service provid## er ? 
why di## d the Commission not opt for a sector @## -## @ by @## -## @ sector approach ? 
what is the role of the service sector in the EU &apos;## s econom## y , and what part of this involve## s cross @## -## @ border activities ? 
what tang## ible result## s relev## ant to the Lisbon Objective## s does the Commission hope to achiev## e with this propos## al ? 
. as the honour## able Member ha## s point## ed out , the propos## ed Direct## ive on service## s in the internal market is at the heart of our ef## fort## s to reform the European econom## y . 
service## s account for approximate## ly 70 % of EU G## DP and employ## ment . 
the remo## val of internal market bar## rier## s in the area of service## s , as foresee## n by the propos## al , is essential for meet## ing the grow## th and employ## ment target## s which lie at the heart of the Lisbon Ag## enda . 
the potent## ial economic opportun## ities ar## ising from this propos## al are in## de## ed huge . 
this ha## s be## en under## line## d by re## cent Dutch economic research which show## s that implement## ation of the propos## al in it## s current form could result in an increas## e in bilateral trade and direct foreign invest## ment in commercial service## s by 15 % to 35 % . 
the Commission ha## s propos## ed a horizontal direct## ive for sever## al different reason## s . 
first , a broad range of service## s is deal## t with be## cause man## y of the bar## rier## s ident## ified are common to vari## ous service activities . 
the most efficient way to address these bar## rier## s is in a horizontal way . 
second## ly , a large scale and detail## ed harmon## isation process through sector## al direct## ive## s would be un## necess## ary , un## realistic and inconsiste## nt with better regulation and subsid## i## arity principle## s . 
t## hirdly , the service## s propos## al take## s in## to account the specific## ity of certain activities , propos## es specific harmon## isation where this is deem## ed necess## ary and adopt## s a phas## ed approach to implement## ation . 
it is clear that the propos## al ha## s provok## ed a great deal of discuss## ion . 
how## ever , this is exact## ly what a propos## al this ambitious and far @## -## @ reach## ing can be expect## ed to do . 
it show## s that the propos## al is address## ing some ver## y import## ant question## s . 
at the same time , this also mean## s that there is a lot of work to be done to achiev## e a common go## al . 
the country of origin approach is a central element of the propos## al , as far as the cross @## -## @ border supply of service## s is concern## ed . 
it eliminate## s the problem of cross @## -## @ border service## s be## ing subject to a multi## tu## de of different rule## s . 
this will stimul## ate the offer of cross @## -## @ border service## s and improve the competitive## ness of the EU econom## y . 
the country of origin approach is in particular essential for SME## s , who do not have the mean## s to establish a subsid## iary or an office in an## other Member State and there## fore can export the## ir know @## -## @ how on## ly by the tempo## rary cross @## -## @ border provision of service## s . 
I wish to note , how## ever , that the country of origin approach does not app## ly for service## s provid## ed through a fix## ed commercial pre## s## ence in the host country . 
at the same time , I wish to reiterate that the country of origin approach does not operate in isol## ation . 
over and above the specific harmon## isation foresee## n for certain activities , the propos## al also foresee## s the further development of administ## rative co## operation between Member State author## ities and administ## rations . 
this harmon## isation and co## operation will generate the degree of con## fidence between Member State## s require## d for the effective application of the country of origin approach . 
final## ly , a number of derog## ations are foresee## n for service## s demonst## rating a particular sensitiv## ity be## cause of the need to protect consum## ers , public health or public securit## y , or where the current diverge## nce of Member State## s &apos; legisl## ation does not allow the application of the country of origin approach . 
as point## ed out in my ear## lier re## ply , the Commission is confident that the propos## al is the best way to allow the economic potent## ial of the service## s sector to material## ise , in the interest of our workers , our consum## ers and our comp## an## ies . 
I also wish to welcome Commission## er McCreevy to hi## s first Que## s## tion Time in Parliament and to re @## -## @ emphasis## e at the out## set that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and object## ive## s be## cause the## y can creat## e great## er wealth and employ## ment with## in the European Union . 
how## ever , turn## ing to hi## s re## ply , one of the big## gest hindrance## s to cross @## -## @ border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one @## -## @ stop shop for registr## ation of a comp## any , that is if one Member State approve## s a comp## any to provid## e that service in that Member State , it should be recipro## cal in all other Member State## s , be## cause the same bas## is for decision @## -## @ making under the internal market rule## s should app## ly . 
. the country of origin approach which lies at the heart of the Service## s Direct## ive will allow for the circum## stance## s Mr C## row## ley ha## s out## line## d . 
as I s## aid in my re## ply , it will allow comp## an## ies to operate in an## other Member State with## out having to go through a multi## tu## de of further test## s . 
that is the bas## is of the country of origin principle as it would app## ly to the circum## stance## s out## line## d . 
I also welcome the Commission## er to hi## s first Que## s## tion Time in this House . 
I should like to ask him , in relation to competitive## ness and economic capacity - aspect## s of the Lisbon Ag## enda - if he would confirm that he share## s my view that structural labour problem## s need to be address## ed , e## special## ly when Europe is compar## ed to the Unit## ed State## s ? 
in this regard , would the Commission## er agree that access by women to the work## place - which is great## ly restrict## ed in the EU compar## ed to the situ## ation in the US , in part be## cause of the lack of afford## able child## care facilit## ies - need## s to be address## ed ? 
will the Commission address this issue ? 
. I welcome Mr M## itch## ell &apos;## s contribut## ion , but would like to point out that the matter## s refer## red to come under the remit of my colleague , Mr Sp## id## la . 
Mr M## itch## ell ha## s gone in## to further problem## s re## l## ating to grow## th with## in the European Comm## un## ity . 
the Lisbon process is about address## ing these matter## s and , as you will be aware , Mr Barros## o ha## s ma## de the Lisbon Ag## enda hi## s top priorit## y for our period in office . 
I note what the honour## able Member ha## s s## aid regard## ing access by women to the labour market and hi## s comment## s about child## care . 
I am s## ure other colleague## s in the Commission will address these matter## s . 
I too wish to welcome Commission## er McCreevy . 
when it come## s to the Service## s Direct## ive , it is clear that not every## one ha## s under## stood why it is need## ed . 
I there## fore think it would be appropriate , and s## hall also ask the Commission## er if it might not be appropriate , to produce a list of ex## ample## s clear## ly show## ing how comp## an## ies have , in practical term## s , be## en prevent## ed from contribut## ing to economic development . 
one ex## ample is the case of a French comp## any that wish## es to produce grave## stone## s be## ing prevent## ed from do## ing s## o by Germa## ns and expose## d to threat## s of fine## s . 
can the Commission## er come back with a full and practical list of the host of problem## s we have seen in S## OL## VI## T and in other con## text## s - problem## s to which comp## an## ies are expose## d and that prevent economic development ? 
. we have produce## d s## uch a document and I s## hall glad## ly s## end a copy of it to the honour## able Member . 
Madam President , I know how hard it is to chair these session## s , but I wonder what relev## ance that supplement## ary had to Mr M## itch## ell &apos;## s origin## al question ? 
Mr## s Cederschiöld seem## ed to have jump## ed back to the pre## vi## ous question . 
I know my colleague Mr De Ross## a had a genuine supplement## ary on the pre## vi## ous question and was re## fuse## d the floor ! 
Mr Mart## in , it is evident that the whole House take## s a great deal of interest in this matter . 
a great man## y Member## s had ask## ed to s## peak , and there is no way for me to know in advance what Member## s &quot; supplement## ary question## s will relate to when I give them the floor . 
per## hap## s you should discuss the matter again with Mr## s Cederschiöld . 
the second part of Que## s## tion Time ha## s al## read## y over## run in any case , which mean## s that Qu## est## ions No## s 31 to 33 can no long## er be take## n , and will in## stead be answer## ed in writing . 
we s## hall now proceed to the next set of question## s . 
the Summit of Ibero## american Head## s of State or Govern## ment agree## d in San Jo## s## é de Costa Rica last N## ov## ember to focus on encourag## ing educ## ation programme## s , as the key to La## tin American development . 
does this also provid## e the Commission with a window of opportun## ity in the field of EU @## -## @ La## tin American relation## s ? 
. Madam President , I must admit that this is my first Que## s## tion Time , but I am look## ing forward to it . 
an opportun## ity to deal with specific issue## s should al## ways be welcome## d . 
I s## hall now s## peak in English . 
this was a question on educ## ation , which is in## de## ed a ver## y import## ant sector in the frame## work of the Commission &apos;## s relation## s with La## tin America . 
the import## ance of this sector ha## s be## en stress## ed by the Head## s of State and Govern## ment of bo## th region## s in Rio , in Madrid , in Guad## alajara and at vari## ous different summit## s , call## ing in particular for the reinforce## ment of regional co## operation at the level of high## er educ## ation . 
the Commission is current## ly implement## ing co## operation programme## s at national , sub## regional and regional level## s in the field of educ## ation worth about EUR 3## 00 million . 
in particular the Commission is financ## ing two regional programme## s in the field of high## er educ## ation . 
one is the Alfa programme - , and the other is the Alba## n programme - . 
the Alfa programme promot## es co## operation between high## er educ## ation institution## s and other relev## ant organisation## s in the two region## s with a view to human and institutional capacity @## -## @ build## ing , mobil## ising the civil soci## ety of bo## th the EU and La## tin America region## s as a whole and there## fore creat## ing and rein## forc## ing last## ing bond## s . 
Alfa 1 cover## s the period 19## 94 @## -## @ 19## 99 and Alfa 2 the period 20## 00 @## -## @ 20## 05 . 
concern## ing al## location## s , Alfa 1 ha## s a budget of EUR 32 million and Alfa 2 a budget of EUR 42 million . 
the Alba## n programme was launch## ed in 20## 02 at the EU @## -## @ La## tin America Madrid summit , there## by respond## ing to the re## commend## ations of the Rio de Jan## e## iro summit . 
the programme a## ward## s scholar## ships to La## tin American national## s for educ## ation train## ing at master and doctor## ate level## s in institution## s in the EU , as well as for high## er train## ing for professional## s from La## tin America in organisation## s in the Union . 
at regional and national level , sever## al educ## ation project## s are be## ing implement## ed , not## ably in basic educ## ation . 
it is worth not## ing that the EUR 7## 4.6 million programme is dedicate## d to educ## ation in the con## text of the programme for re## construct## ion and re## habilit## ation in C## ent## ral America follow## ing Hurricane M## itch in 19## 98 . 
in Nicaragua the Commission is contribut## ing to the improve## ment of the educ## ation sector through budget support total## ling EUR 6## 2.5 million . 
Madam President , I would like first of all to welcome the Commission## er , Mr## s Ferr## ero , who , as well as having an adopt## ed Hispanic sur## name , ha## s a master## y of S## pan## ish and is knowledge## able about La## tin America . 
her re## ply ha## s satisfied me . 
s## he ha## s told me what I want## ed to know about the Commission &apos;## s support for the educ## ation programme## s and , in particular , for the instrument I refer## red to in my question , the Summit of Ibero## american Head## s of State or Govern## ment , which is ma## de up of the S## pan## ish## - and Port## uguese @## -## @ s## peak## ing countries of La## tin America , as well as Spa## in and Port## ugal . 
I thank you o## nce again , Commission## er . 
we will have the opportun## ity to discuss these issue## s further in the futur## e . 
. since the answer ha## s al## read## y be## en give## n , I have nothing to add . 
in it## s campaign entitle## d &apos; Would you leave it to chance ? - We don &apos;## t &apos; the Commission is s## end## ing out the mess## age that Europe ha## s a substanti## al amount of money avail## able for development co## operation . 
the statement by Commission## er Ferr## ero @## -## @ Wal## d## ner in this campaign say## s that the world must become a better place , but this evident## ly mean## s prim## arily for European## s and that development co## operation must in the first in## stance bring st## ability to our &apos; im## mediate neighbour## hood &apos; . 
combat## ing p## over## ty ha## s be## en releg## ated to a second## ary role . 
can the Commission say whet## her this approach , which is prim## arily design## ed to make Europe more secure ra## ther th## an provid## ing per## man## ent solution## s to thir## d world development , is compatible with the development age## nda of the develop## ing countries and consist## ent with Article 1## 77 of the Treat## y and the UN M## ill## ennium go## al## s ? 
. 
as the Commission point## ed out when it launch## ed the post## er campaign , the priorit## ies of European Commission development co## operation are : to reduce and eventual## ly eradic## ate p## over## ty ; promot## e sustain## able development ; build demo## cracies ; contribut## e to the integration of develop## ing countries in## to the world econom## y ; support good govern## ance and promot## e respect for human right## s . 
the Commission is commit## ted to help## ing develop## ing countries achiev## e the development go## al## s of the mill## ennium . 
how## ever , there are import## ant object## ive## s and activities that go far beyond the mill## ennium development go## al## s . 
for ex## ample , promot## ing peace and securit## y and also support## ing institution build## ing . 
a comprehens## ive , integrate## d approach is there## fore essential in achiev## ing sustain## able development , as ma## de clear also by the Treat## y on European Union in Article 3 , which emphasis## es the import## ance of assuring consist## ency of external poli## cies and instrument## s in the con## text of external relation## s , securit## y , development , economic and trade policy . 
this is also clear## ly stress## ed in the 20## 04 annual report on the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s development policy . 
the Comm## un## ity &apos;## s external action## s , including assist## ance , are further adapt## ed to the divers## ity of our partner region## s and countries . 
the European neighbour## hood policy is an express## ion of s## uch a comprehens## ive and integrate## d partner strate## gy . 
similar## ly , our relation## s with the large## r develop## ing countries in Asia and La## tin America in particular cover a broad range of object## ive## s . 
in this con## text , it is clear that bring## ing concrete benefit## s to our partner## s will make the world a better place , not on## ly for the people direct## ly benefit## ing from EC assist## ance but also for European citizen## s . 
how## ever , this does not change the over## rid## ing object## ive of the development policy of the European Commission , that is to eradic## ate p## over## ty . 
Madam President , I am pleas## ed with the Commission## er &apos;## s respons## e , be## cause I have to say that I was a li## ttle shock## ed when I read her statement of 2 Dec## ember . 
in## de## ed , one could have be## en forgiv## en for think## ing that the object## ive## s that s## he list## ed di## d not agree with the mill## ennium object## ive## s . 
Commission## er , this issue ha## s be## en discuss## ed in the Committee on Budget## ary Control be## fore . 
in this respect too , you have encroach## ed upon the area of development co## operation . 
Mr Michel is the Commission## er for Develop## ment and I think that good agree## ments will need to be ma## de , also in term## s of statement## s ma## de , to prevent what you s## aid from be## ing mis## interpret## ed in the broad## er con## text of the mill## ennium object## ive## s . 
I should like to ask you to consult with Mr Michel ver## y care## fully on this score . 
. 
thank you for acknowledg## ing that this campaign is going to the right development go## al## s . 
it under## line## s the key sector## s of the external assist## ance policy , as define## d in the development policy communic## ation and in the development go## al## s . 
there are seven element## s to the seven priorit## ies of the European Commission intervention . 
one is prosper## ity , achiev## ed by trade and the privat## e sector . 
second , securit## y , which is be## ing achiev## ed via justice and regional co## operation . 
thir## d is free## dom , achiev## ed by human right## s and good govern## ance . 
four## th is food : food securit## y and r## ural development . 
fifth , water : the water initiative protect## ing sustain## able development . 
Six## th , educ## ation : educ## ation system## s and access to school## s . 
last## ly , the Europe## Aid mess## age - &apos; partner## ships im## prov## ing live## s world## wide &apos; - evoke## s the how and why of external assist## ance . 
with regard to s## cope , the campaign is reach## ing out to over 1## 50 countries world## wide . 
it is establish## ing long @## -## @ term partner## ships , and it## s approach is to focus on owner## ship of project## s in partner countries . 
priorit## y area## s result## s are also to be focus## ed upon : there must be a demonst## r## able impact on people &apos;## s live## s . 
this campaign ha## s re## ally gone to the heart of what we want to do and come## s under the umbr## ella of the over## all go## al## s . 
in the light of Israel &apos;## s continu## ed breach of the EU @## -## @ Israel Protocol## s , will the Commission consider the suspens## ion of these agree## ments ? 
the human right## s clause in the EU @## -## @ Israel Associ## ation Agreement place## s &apos; economic free## dom and the principle## s of the Unit## ed Nation## s Char## ter , particular## ly the observ## ance of human right## s and demo## cracy &quot; as &apos; the ver## y bas## is of the Associ## ation . &quot; 
Article 2 , the Ope## rative Claus## e , clear## ly states that &apos; relation## s between the Parti## es , as well as all the provision## s of the agree## ment it## self , s## hall be bas## ed on respect for human right## s and democratic principle## s , which guide## s the## ir internal and international policy and constitut## es an essential element of this Agreement . &quot; 
. 
in respons## e to your call for the suspens## ion of the EU @## -## @ Israel Associ## ation Agreement , it is the Commission &apos;## s judge## ment that measure## s s## uch as sanction## s would make the Israel## i author## ities less , ra## ther th## an more , respons## ive to the ef## fort## s of the international communit## y to promot## e a last## ing solution . 
this is at a time when the EU is seek## ing to have a ver## y construct## ive role in ens## uring that the withdraw## al from Gaz## a take## s place in a posit## ive climate , in co## operation with a new , and now democratic## ally @## -## @ elect## ed , Palestinian leader## ship . 
I fully recognis## e the frust## rations of th## ose seek## ing to promot## e the peace process when confront## ed by Israel &apos;## s expansion of it## s settle## ment activities . 
the European Commission ha## s regular## ly express## ed it## s concern## s not on## ly at the continu## ing terrorism and viol## ence but also at the rout## e of the separat## ion bar## rier and the expansion of settle## ments . 
our wish is to address these issue## s through dia## logue . 
the Commission is seek## ing to develop relation## s with Israel and the Palestinian## s through the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy , through support for Palestinian reform## s and the development of political dia## logue with Israel . 
the action plan adopt## ed for Israel include## s measure## s to strength## en dia## logue and co## operation on the import## ance of adhere## nce to international law and the need to pre## serve the perspective of a vi## able , comprehens## ive settle## ment , which involve## s minimis## ing the impact of securit## y and counter @## -## @ terrorism measure## s on the civil## ian population . 
it is the Commission &apos;## s view - and I believ## e this is share## d by the Member State## s - that measure## s to suspend the EU @## -## @ Israel Associ## ation Agreement would there## fore be counter## productive . 
I fully accept what the Commission## er say## s about the changing circum## stance## s . 
since I table## d this question , Mr Abba## s ha## s be## en elect## ed as leader of the Palestinian## s and we have seen Mr Pere## s join the Israel## i Govern## ment . 
that give## s us some hope for dia## logue between the two side## s . 
how## ever , I would ask her , in her new role , to keep this Protocol under const## ant review and to keep the pressure on Israel to observ## e the content## s of the Protocol . 
I know that in the past the Commission ha## s take## n action on product## s that have come from East Jerusalem , the Go## lan H## eight## s , the West Bank and the Gaz## a S## trip . 
I ask her to continu## e to monitor the situ## ation to ensu## re that product## s from th## ose area## s are not label## led as &apos; product## s of Israel &apos; . 
. 
I can assure you that the Commission will certain## ly do that , be## cause just be## fore Christ## mas we had s## uch a Council meet## ing . 
this ha## s of course be## en one of the import## ant issue## s in the Council s## o we will try to do our best to get bo## th part## ies to abide by the## ir oblig## ations . 
on 9 Dec## ember , at the time of the adopt## ion of the initial action plan## s for the new European neighbour## hood policy , the Commission## er respons## ible for external relation## s and European neighbour## hood policy stated that hi## s object## ive was to creat## e a circl## e of friend## s a## round the enlarge## d Union &apos;## s border## s . 
of the seven countries with which the first action plan## s we## re conclude## d , on## ly Ukraine direct## ly share## s terr## es## trial border## s with the enlarge## d Union . 
on the other hand , Belarus , which share## s border## s with three new EU Member State## s is , accord## ing to the Commission## er , not democratic en## ough to be include## d in the programme . 
does the Commission plan to implement other internal measure## s to resolv## e the Belarus problem ? 
does it intend to take account of the propos## al## s to set up a cross @## -## @ cut## ting Comm## un## ity assist## ance programme in the field of human right## s and demo## cracy or to broadcast radio or TV programme## s from neighbour## ing countries ? 
are there plan## s to set up an EU delegation in Minsk or to appoint an EU represent## ative to Belarus ? 
these initiative## s would contribut## e to the build## ing @## -## @ up of civil soci## ety in Belarus and to the process of democrat## isation , with## out in any way compromis## ing with the country &apos;## s author## itarian regime . 
. 
the Commission under## line## s that the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy## frame## work is ver## y import## ant , and it want## s to reinforce further the relation## ship between the enlarge## d European Union and it## s neighbour## s , including Belarus . 
a key principle of the &apos; R## ing of Friend## s &apos; is for## ging joint owner## ship . 
the Union can## not impose it## s policy on any## one , but it is read## y to convince it## s neighbour## s of the benefit## s of the E## NP . 
the Union is offer## ing close## r co## operation a## cross the spec## trum of it## s relation## s - from political dia## logue to economic integration - on the bas## is of commit## ment to common value## s . 
this offer is , in principle , also valid for Belarus . 
through the E## NP , the Union is read## y to reinforce it## s last## ing commit## ment to support## ing democratic development in Belarus . 
if and when fundamental political and economic reform## s take place , it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involve## d in the E## NP , with all the benefit## s that would bring . 
under current conditio## ns , how## ever , there can be no fully @## -## @ fledg## ed E## NP action plan for Belarus . 
the October 20## 04 parliament## ary elect## ions and the refer## endum we## re import## ant mile## stone## s for Belarus under the E## NP , but , un## fortunate## ly , Belarus fail## ed to achiev## e them . 
how## ever , there remain## s a clear prospect for deepen## ing relation## s , including under the frame## work of the E## NP , provid## ed that fundamental reform## s are car## ried out . 
at present , a key element - and this is also an issue in EU policy to## ward## s Belarus - is to support civil soci## ety and the process of democrat## isation . 
in add## ition , Belarus will continu## e to be able to benefit from the relev## ant regional , cross @## -## @ border and the## matic programme## s . 
the Commission is step## ping up it## s ef## fort to co## ordinate assist## ance for democrat## isation and civil soci## ety . 
more## over , the Commission is also look## ing - and here I want go in## to detail - in## to the possibil## ity of support## ing civil soci## ety and the democratic process in a flex## ible mann## er . 
in the first place , the assist## ance should be operation## al and manage## d in the country concern## ed . 
but the Commission does not exclude specific situ## ations where a project would be implement## ed main## ly out## side Belarus . 
the modal## ities for do## ing s## o need to be care## fully consider## ed in the light of the relev## ant rule## s and regulation## s . 
support for in## dependent media and inform## ation dissemin## ation is a## mong the key priorit## ies of EU assist## ance . 
a radio or tele## vision station broadcast## ing to Belarus out## side the country is an interest## ing idea , but require## s further clar## ification as to whet## her s## uch an initiative could be support## ed by EU fund## s under the exist## ing rule## s and regulation## s . 
as to the question of open## ing a delegation in Belarus , it must be borne in mind that the EU ha## s limit## ed resource## s for extend## ing it## s network of fully @## -## @ fledg## ed delegation## s . 
Belarus is cover## ed by the European Commission delegation in Ki## ev , which ha## s a technical assist## ance office in Minsk . 
the Commission will look in## to the possibil## ities of al## locating , with## in the exist## ing structure## s , additional human resource## s for work in Belarus . 
at the moment , open## ing a European Commission delegation in Minsk is not , how## ever , be## ing consider## ed . 
Commission## er , I should also like to congratul## ate you on your first Que## s## tion Time . 
your detail## ed re## plies would seem to indic## ate that the Commission will in fact be work## ing ver## y active## ly in Belarus . 
I should like to ask whet## her you believ## e co## operation with the current Belarus## s## ian author## ities to be possible , even in the present circum## stance## s ? 
. Madam President , there can be no question of us co## oper## ating with the author## ities at present . 
what we can do , how## ever , and as I mention## ed be## fore , is to provid## e particular support for civil soci## ety , and also to focus ef## fort## s on work## ing with the academ## ic communit## y . 
I can tell you that we are plan## ning to hold three work## shop## s in order to ident## ify exact## ly what we can do , involv## ing non @## -## @ governmental organisation## s and as man## y neighbour## ing countries as possible , as we share the view that support for civil soci## ety is the on## ly opportun## ity avail## able to us at present to bring about change in Belarus . 
man## y thank## s . 
Commission## er , it would seem that it is in## de## ed essential to involve Belarus &apos;## s neighbour## s in ef## fort## s to support the development of civil soci## ety in that country . 
academ## ic programme## s and programme## s re## l## ating to the in## dependent media can on## ly be implement## ed with the co## operation of neighbour## ing countries . 
I believ## e that find## ing project## s that might lead to additional fund## ing for s## uch measure## s would be the best way of ens## uring that in futur## e we will be able to establish co## operation with a genuine democratic govern## ment in Belarus . 
. 
first I should like to point out that I have al## read## y answer## ed , in principle , the question of the media . 
I clear## ly point## ed out the Commission &apos;## s opinion for the time be## ing . 
how## ever , with regard to project## s and money I can give you some ex## ample## s : the EU &apos;## s support for civil soci## ety is to be strength## ened ; the EU &apos;## s TA## CIS programme - which amount## s to EUR 10 million for Belarus in 20## 05 and 20## 06 - will focus on support for civil soci## ety , in## dependent media - exact## ly what you want## ed us to focus on ; high## er educ## ation co## operation including exchange## s of stu## dent## s and profess## ors ; and allevi## ation of the con## sequenc## es of the Che## rnobyl catastrophe . 
the provision of inform## ation to the general public with regard to the European Union and the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy will also be strength## ened . 
in add## ition , the Tem## pu## s Pro## gramme will finance exchange## s of young Belarus## ian univers## ity stu## dent## s a## broad , curr## iculum development on European stu## dies and capacity @## -## @ build## ing in local univers## ities . 
as I s## aid , Belarus is in## de## ed elig## ible under the New Neighbour## hood programme## s . 
it will there## fore benefit from the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy instrument as of 20## 07 . 
final## ly , the European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s - the EI## DH## R - will have a more active role in Belarus in the year## s to come . 
in 20## 05 @## -## @ 20## 06 Belarus## ian appli## cant## s will be able to app## ly for support under two campaign## s : &apos; foster## ing a culture of human right## s &apos; and &apos; promot## ing democratic process## es &apos; . 
I should like to know whet## her the European Commission is aware that these much @## -## @ need## ed educational programme## s are under the control of the Belarus## s## ian author## ities , and there## fore can## not be regard## ed as tru## e support for the process of democrat## isation in Belarus . 
I should also like to ask whet## her , in the light of the Commission## er &apos;## s comment## s , a s## um of money will be earmark## ed under the EI## DH## R ( European I## nitiative for Demo## cracy and Human Right## s ) programme to support in## dependent initiative## s in Belarus , bear## ing in mind that over re## cent year## s not a s## ing## le euro from the fund ha## s y## et be## en set a## side for this purpose . 
. 
as I s## aid be## fore , we will have three work## shop## s . 
the last of them will be in Lithuania , which invit## ed the Commission to work together with some neighbour## ing countries on new idea## s and strate## gies ; on what can be done with N## GO## s and other## s . 
I will certain## ly take up this suggest## ion in th## ose work## shop## s to see what can be done , but it must fit in## to the frame## work of the regulation## s that are there . 
how## ever , we will certain## ly consider that . 
question## s No## s 38 to 41 will be answer## ed in writing . 
question## s No## s 39 and 40 laps## e , as the## y are al## read## y on the age## nda for this part @## -## @ session . 
article## s appear## ing in the high## ly repu## table &apos; Vi## ma &apos; news## paper of 5 and 7 Dec## ember 20## 04 reveal the discover## y of a tele## phone tap## ping network set up by the Italia## n author## ities and us## ed to eaves## drop on mobile and fix## ed tele## phone convers## ations by Greek citizen## s in Greece . 
this ha## s be## en confirm## ed in a report produce## d by the Public Prosecutor &apos;## s Office in Bar## i ( I## ta## ly ) and quote## d by the news## paper . 
it emerge## s that the network was set up with## out any court order having be## en issu## ed by the Greek author## ities , while senior Greek police and fraud squad office## rs indic## ate that the## y we## re tip## ped off o## nce the network had al## read## y be## en set up by Italia## n function## aries . 
will the Commission re## quest inform## ation from the Italia## n and Greek author## ities on this matter ? 
does it know whet## her any form of complain## t ha## s be## en register## ed to d## ate by the Greek author## ities at the eaves## drop## ping by the Italia## n author## ities on Greek citizen## s with## out a court order ? 
is it admiss## ible , in the absence of a court order by a Member State , for tele## phone convers## ations by citizen## s of that Member State to be monitor## ed by the author## ities of an## other Member State ? 
. the Commission ha## s not be## en inform## ed of any de## position by the Greek author## ities concern## ing any of the fact## s mention## ed by the honour## able Member . 
since phone tap## s al## ways require an assess## ment of the proportion## ality of the potent## ial infringe## ment of fundamental right## s in relation to the public interest serv## ed by s## uch measure## s , permit## ting phone tap## s as a mean## s of conduct## ing criminal investig## ations are in most case## s subject to a court warrant . 
when the competent author## ities of one Member State in the course of criminal investig## ations in the## ir own country need to carry out tap## s on phone## s or tele## communic## ation service## s located in an## other Member State the## y must follow the procedure## s that have be## en put in place for that purpose . 
the European Commission obvi## ously does not have the mean## s to judge the behaviour of in## dependent judicial author## ities . 
the main European instrument provid## ing for this situ## ation is the 20## 00 Convent## ion on Mutual Assi## stance in Criminal Mat## ter## s between the Member State## s of the European Union . 
until s## uch time as this Convent## ion enter## s in## to force , Member State## s can have re## course to the 19## 59 Council of Europe Convent## ion on Mutual Assi## stance in Criminal Mat## ter## s and to Council of Europe Re## commend## ation ( 85 ) 10 concern## ing letter## s rogatory for the intercept## ion of tele## communic## ations . 
Madam President , Commission## er , I welcome you but you surprise me . 
it is in## comprehens## ible that the Commission should avoid comment## ing on a serious infringe## ment of the basic rule## s of data protection . 
we have had tele## phone tap## ping in Greece of Greek citizen## s by the Italia## n author## ities in the absence of any Greek author## ities . 
Commission## er , a few week## s ago you we## re a minister in the Italia## n Govern## ment . 
why can you not pick up the tele## phone and ask bo## th the Italia## n and the Greek Govern## ment what happen## ed ? 
. I would like to apolog## ise to Mr Papa## dimoulis , but I can on## ly repeat that the Commission ha## s not receiv## ed any inform## ation about this case . 
at any rate , the Commission does not have the legal right to rule on a breach which , if commit## ted , would have be## en commit## ted by an in## dependent judicial author## ity and not by a governmental author## ity of a Member State . 
there are legal instrument## s avail## able , which I point## ed out : in particular , Council of Europe re## commend## ations and the Council of Europe &apos;## s Convent## ion on Mutual Assi## stance . 
- Madam President , Commission## er , I think there ha## s be## en an## other mistake here or some## thing ha## s escape## d you . 
last Dec## ember , the and news## paper## s report## ed extens## ive## ly on tele## phone tap## ping ; the## y even had special dia## gram## s of a de## vice which perpet## rates this crime , in or out of invert## ed com## mas . 
this de## vice exist## s some## where in Mi## lan or southern I## ta## ly . 
I wonder , there## fore , how is it that you too have not y## et found out about it , s## o that you can make the relev## ant observ## ations today . 
. of course , what Mr Ma## v## rom## mat## is s## aid is correct . 
the Italia## n news## paper## s have report## ed certain fact## s ; n## ever## the## less the Commission can and must remain with## in the s## cope of it## s legal power## s , which do not include the power to subject the behaviour of judicial author## ities to investig## ations or action## s . 
there are instrument## s , including with## in the national states , which allow a judge who ha## s car## ried out an illegal activity to be prosecu## ted , but that clear## ly can## not happen at the re## quest of the Commission . 
Commission## er , regard## less of the fact## s of this case , when you next meet the justice minister## s , will you make it clear to them that , under the vari## ous international convention## s you mention and in the spirit of member## ship of the European Union , it is un## accept## able for the author## ities of one Member State - be the## y political or judicial - to carry out phone tap## ping in an## other Member State , with## out the express approval of that Member State ? 
. Mr Mart## in , you are absolut## e## ly correct and this is certain## ly the right path to take . 
as you are prob## ably aware , in I## ta## ly it fall## s on the one hand to the Minister for Just## ice and , on the other , to the judic## iary &apos;## s self @## -## @ govern## ing body to take action again## st judge## s who commit illegal act## s . 
I have natural## ly pass## ed this re## quest on to the Italia## n Minister for Just## ice . 
what is the Commission &apos;## s view on react## ions to the Commission &apos;## s annual report on Migr## ation ( Ju## ly 20## 04 ) , including the view of expert## s s## uch as S## OL## ID## AR ( Ka## tri## n Hug## en## du## bel ) and the Soci## al Plat## form of N## GO## s that it is difficult to establish &apos; best practice &apos; on integration policy when the con## text## s of e## ach EU Member State are s## o different ? 
. it is certain## ly tru## e that there are different approach## es to integration represent## ed in the Member State## s . 
con## cept and practice varie## s due to a number of factor## s : different im## migration histo## ries and vari## ations in the role## s of govern## ment and civil soci## ety with respect to integration poli## cies are just two ex## ample## s . 
the Commission consist## ent## ly stress## ed that integration policy was by definition an area where subsid## i## arity is at s## take . 
on the other hand , all Member State## s adhere to human right## s standard## s and share## d value## s s## uch as equal## ity anti @## -## @ discrimin## ation , solid## arity , tolerance , etc .. 
through the on## going exchange of inform## ation and experience , particular## ly through the work of national contact point## s for integration , we are now see## ing a certain degree of converge## nce with respect to policy approach## es , go## al## s and target## s . 
this was confirm## ed in Dec## ember with the adopt## ion by the Council of common basic principle## s on integration . 
the public## ation by the Commission in N## ov## ember 20## 04 of a hand## book on integration for policy maker## s and practitioner## s , which bring## s together ex## ample## s of good practice from through## out the Union on introdu## ction programme## s , civic particip## ation and integration indic## ators , illust## rates that there are man## y common problem## s and show## s how much we can learn from e## ach other . 
best practice must be take## n for what it is : idea## s , less## ons to be learn## ed and suggest## ions which can inspir## e and inform policy maker## s in the definition of the poli## cies require## d . 
I thank the Commission## er for that clear answer . 
I know from the pre## vi## ous debate that you take the issue of integration serious## ly . 
the Commission ha## s a real impact on integration policy and a direct role , for ex## ample , in the enforce## ment of exist## ing direct## ive## s , which are cruc## ial to integration - I refer explic## it## ly to the Em## ploy## ment Direct## ive and the Rac## e E## qual## ity Direct## ive . 
the Commission ha## s play## ed a strong role in try## ing to enforce these direct## ive## s . 
the## y remain un## implement## ed in at least two Member State## s that I am aware of . 
will you use your power## s in office to enforce s## uch direct## ive## s , which play s## uch an import## ant part in the integration process ? 
you have that power . 
. y## es , of course the Commission ha## s s## uch power , and I can re## assure you that the Commission will use all it## s power to guarantee , stimul## ate and encourag## e Member State## s to fully implement all direct## ive## s in the common European interest . 
Commission## er , I s## hall s## peak in your mother ton## gue in order to be forth## right with regard to an old question : illegal im## migration . 
the land## ing## s of illegal im## migrants will certain## ly not wait for us to come up with a common strate## gy be## fore the## y resum## e in the Medi## terranean . 
certain## ly , the on## ly reason the## y are not continu## ing at the moment as well is be## cause the poor wretch## es are ly## ing on the sea## bed . 
s## o I would like to ask , what is the Commission do## ing and what ha## s be## en planned for the near futur## e to help countries on the border## s of the European Union - I am refer## ring in particular to my country , Mal## ta - in order to provid## e aid and to receiv## e illegal im## migrants in a proper mann## er ? 
what level of fund## ing will be allocate## d for this ? 
. the question of illegal im## migration is one which the Commission consider## s to be a priorit## y . 
while we are prepar## ing political action## s and common European solution## s , as you point## ed out , we must also address the dai## ly trage## dy of despe## rate people . 
the Commission can and must take action , and it will , in order to ensu## re that the fundamental right## s of person## s enter## ing European ter## rit## ory are respect## ed , obvi## ously including th## ose who enter illegal## ly : the right to respect for human life and dign## ity is not a question of legal differ## ence## s . 
having s## aid that , we must speed up the strategic poli## cies . 
we can## not take advantage of a delay and there## by continu## e to allow an illegal in## flux , but we must im## mediate## ly respect the fundamental right## s of individual## s and at the same time prepar## e common poli## cies on re## ception , on the one hand , and the prevent## ion of illegal activities , on the other . 
in the Council frame## work decision of 13 Ju## ne 20## 02 on the fight again## st terrorism , the Member State## s we## re require## d to pass legisl## ation in a number of area## s relate## d to combat## ing terrorism , with a view to establish## ing common definition## s in the face of the threat## s in question . 
Article 11 of this frame## work decision call## ed on the Commission and Council to make an assess## ment by the end of 20## 03 of the form## s of implement## ation by the Member State## s of specific anti @## -## @ terrorism measure## s . 
these text## s we## re final## ly submit## ted by the Commission ( 8 Ju## ne 20## 04 - COM ( 20## 04 ) 04## 09 / final ) and the Council ( 12 October 20## 04 - 1## 16## 87 / 2 / 04 / rev## .## 2 ) . 
bo## th report## s stress , in clear and object## ive fashion , the pass## ivity of the Member State## s and the## ir fail## ure to comp## ly with the object## ive## s set out in the Council frame## work decision . 
the Commission does not possess bind## ing legal instrument## s to oblig## e the Member State## s to comp## ly with frame## work decision## s . 
de## spite this and with a view to ens## uring the EU &apos;## s cred## ibility in the fight again## st terrorism , can the Commission state how it intend## s to promot## e and obtain a genuine anti @## -## @ terrorist policy at Union level and ensu## re that the Member State## s act on the## ir promise## s regard## ing legisl## ative action ? 
. accord## ing to Article 34 of the Treat## y on European Union , frame## work decision## s are bind## ing upon the Member State## s as to the result to be achiev## ed but leave to the national author## ities the cho## ice of form and method## s . 
how## ever , frame## work decision## s &apos; s## hall not entail direct effect &apos; . 
where## as , with## in the first pillar , the Commission ha## s the author## ity to initiate an infringe## ment procedure again## st a Member State , this possibil## ity does not exist with## in the Treat## y on European Union . 
the situ## ation describ## ed by the honour## able Member certain## ly does not facilit## ate the Commission &apos;## s role , but it does not prevent it from pro## duc## ing a broad range of policy initiative## s , which have be## en the bas## is for the policy definition of the Union in the import## ant area of the fight again## st terrorism . 
the Commission ha## s be## en play## ing this role ver## y active## ly in establish## ing in Ju## ne 20## 04 the revise## d action plan on combat## ing terrorism , in up## d## ating it in Dec## ember 20## 04 and in implement## ing more th## an half of the respect## ive measure## s . 
this is also evident from the sub## mission , in October 20## 04 , of four communic## ations cover## ing different aspect## s of the prevent## ion , prepar## ed## ness and respons## e to terrorist attack## s and from the adopt## ion , in the same year , of a communic## ation on mutual access to data relev## ant to the fight again## st terrorism and of sever## al class## ified document## s in the field of con## sequenc## e manage## ment and the protection of critical infra## structure## s . 
the Commission in general and President Barros## o and I in particular are determine## d to work in close co## operation with Council preside## ncies to maintain the fight again## st terrorism . 
this is ver## y high on the age## nda of the Council , including that of the JHA Council and the European Council com## prising the Head## s of State and Govern## ment . 
I am well aware of the legal frame## work in which the European anti @## -## @ terrorism policy can operate as far as the Commission is concern## ed and you describ## ed it ver## y well . 
if , how## ever , we do not wish to demonst## rate collect## ive hypo## cris## y , we need to say how thing## s stand . 
and the way the## y stand is that we have major conference## s , with all the Head## s of Govern## ment present , and after## ward## s the## y have a press conference , set out a decision and follow## ing this decision nothing happen## s . 
the Commission it## self admitted as much on 8 Ju## ne 20## 04 . 
the question is , there## fore : what is the Commission going to do in political term## s to put the policy in## to practice ? 
. the Commission will begin to set out the action plan for the implement## ation of the Ha## gue Pro## gramme at the inform## al meet## ing of the Minister## s for Inter## nal Affair## s and for Just## ice at the end of the month . 
the action plan will be present## ed in May this year and I hope that it will be adopt## ed by the European Council in Ju## ne . 
the action plan on combat## ing terrorism will contain tang## ible measure## s and guide## line## s , precise dead## line## s for the Member State## s and bind## ing oblig## ations for a common policy to enhance co## operation , inform## ation exchange and protection for the victim## s of terrorist attack## s . 
these are the measure## s that the Commission initial## ly intend## s to put be## fore Parliament , some## thing which we s## hall do at the begin## ning of Fe## bru## ary , that is , well be## fore we draw up our propos## al , and we s## hall th## en listen to Parliament &apos;## s opinion on the concrete propos## al## s . 
what progress is the Commission making to## ward## s propos## ing a standard## ised set of crite## ria for the report## ing of crime## s and collect## ion of statistic## s about crime## s a## cross the European Union ? 
until s## uch a system is establish## ed , it is difficult for law enforce## ment office## rs to have a clear picture of the ex## tent of organise## d criminal activity , and it is there## fore ver## y difficult to counter the gang## s effective## ly . 
. the Commission agree## s that the absence of compar## able crime statistic## s make## s the development of an effective EU law enforce## ment policy more difficult . 
the Commission is work## ing on a draft action plan on EU crime statistic## s . 
Member State crime statistic## s expert## s are be## ing consult## ed on this draft action plan , which will be present## ed in the form of a Commission communic## ation in the spring of 20## 05 . 
the two main block## s of the draft action plan are : first , the setting up of appropriate co## ordination machine## ry to ensu## re that Member State## s , the Commission and other key actor## s are part of the process of work## ing to## ward## s common data @## -## @ gather## ing method## s and harmon## ised definition ; the second element concern## s the implement## ation of develop## ing compar## able statistic## s . 
this will include man## y different component## s , to be develop## ed over a period of time , s## uch as definition## s of crime type## s and an invent## ory of definition## s where there is al## read## y EU @## -## @ level agree## ment . 
the Commission , in close co## operation with Euro## pol and other provid## ers and us## ers of EU crime statistic## s , is develop## ing this project on a step @## -## @ by @## -## @ step bas## is in accord## ance with Member State## s &apos; ability to provid## e relev## ant data . 
the Commission &apos;## s draft action plan was discuss## ed with European director## s of social statistic## s in Sept## ember 20## 04 . 
it was agree## d to set up a task force to examin## e appropriate statistic## al method## s for monitor## ing crime . 
this task force will begin it## s work in May 20## 05 . 
I should also mention that the Commission is provid## ing support for work be## ing under## take## n to measure statistic## ally the qual## ity and effective## ness of the judicial process . 
a seminar on this subject , co @## -## @ financ## ed by the EU &apos;## s AG## IS Pro## gramme , was host## ed by the Italia## n Mini## s## try of Just## ice in Rome in October 20## 04 . 
thank you , Commission## er , for stay## ing to answer the question . 
I am ver## y grat## e## ful that you recognis## e the urge## ncy of this problem be## cause with open border## s a## cross the Union , organise## d crime is free to operate and to prosper , while our police force## s are national and can## not cross the front## iers . 
s## o we have a real problem . 
I am glad that you are treat## ing this with consider## able urge## ncy . 
could you tell us who will be respons## ible for the co## ordinating machine## ry ? 
will this be done by Euro## pol or will it be done by the Commission - or may## be a new age## ncy ? 
. I do not think that we can or should creat## e new bodies ; I think that on the one hand the Commission should give strategic , or ra## ther political direct## ion to this sector and , on the other hand , the sector should have the chance to find different ways to use Euro## pol , which as we all know is try## ing to extend it## s du## ties and it## s remit . 
the Commission intend## s to encourag## e this progress## ion , this expansion of Euro## pol &apos;## s du## ties . 
this is un## doubt## ed## ly one of the sector## s where work can be done . 
Madam President , I would like to make a few remark## s : some of my fellow Member## s , like my## self , have be## en here since the start of the s## itt## ing , have submit## ted written question## s and have not had the opportun## ity of receiv## ing a re## ply in the Chamber which the## y could th## en counter with a further question , whet## her the## y we## re satisfied or not . 
the Bur## eau and the legal depart## ments should better consider the matter of Que## s## tion Time and give proper thought as to the time allott## ed and how man## y question## s can be answer## ed in that time , be## cause we can## not oblig## e a Member to stay in the Chamber all this time and th## en not have the satisf## action of receiv## ing an im## mediate , direct re## ply from the competent Commission## er . 
the situ## ation deserve## s to be look## ed in## to by Parliament &apos;## s administ## ration . 
it is absolut## e## ly in## toler## able for a situ## ation of this kind to arise . 
Mr## s S## bar## bati , the Rule## s of Procedure lay down quit## e clear rule## s for the holding of Que## s## tion Time . 
a great man## y Member## s ask## ed to s## peak on a certain topic ear## lier , and I could not give the floor to every## one . 
in my opinion , the main problem is that man## y Member## s spend a long time ask## ing supplement## ary question## s , and do not abide by the 30 @## -## @ second time limit , which of course mean## s that we are often delay## ed . 
I will , how## ever , bear your comment## s in mind . 
I should like to extend my sincere thank## s to every## one , and e## special## ly to Commission## er F## rat## tini again for be## ing prepar## ed to remain s## o long in the Chamber with us for Que## s## tion Time . 
question## s No## s 46 to 76 will be answer## ed in writing . 
Mr President , I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rule## s of Procedure . 
we saw this House s## pi## ed on in a dis## graceful mann## er d## uring the last elect## ion period , and it appear## s that this is al## read## y happen## ing again , in that I heard yesterday that at least one attend## ance list from Dec## ember 20## 04 was give## n - I stress give## n - to a Member in order that he might make a copy of it . 
there are two question## s I would like to ask about this . 
first## ly , is there any bas## is in fact for what I have be## en told ? 
second## ly , if there is , is there any bas## is in law for this be## ing done ? 
I am not s## ure whet## her this is exact## ly a point of order , but , in any e## vent , I can re## ply by say## ing that the Bur## eau ha## s al## read## y look## ed in## to this issue , which ha## s be## en communic## ated to the legal service## s , and we are await## ing a report from th## ose service## s s## o that we can act accord## ing## ly . 
the next item is the Council State## ment on the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency . 
the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr Ju## ncker , Pr## ime Minister of Luxembourg , ha## s the floor , and I would like o## nce again to express Parliament &apos;## s sad## ness at the death of her Roy## al High## ness , the Grand Du## ches## s Jose## ph## ine @## -## @ Char## lotte of Luxembourg , Prince## s## s of Bel## g## ium . 
. 
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commission## er , lad## ies and gentle## men , I must say , it is al## ways a pleas## ure to come to Strasbourg , the ver## y embodi## ment of the European city , a city that symbol## ises the re## conciliation between France and Germa## ny , a meet## ing point for s## o man## y European ambit## ions and an inter## section of s## o man## y continent## al dream## s . 
in add## ition to my pleas## ure at be## ing here , I have the honour today to present to Parliament - the elect## ed represent## ative## s of the people## s of Europe - the priorit## ies for the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union . the Luxembourg Presidency follow## s that of our Dutch friend## s . 
I must pay heart## felt trib## ute to the## ir hard work , the## ir tena## city and the## ir un## deni## able success## es . 
the EU ma## de significant progress under the Dutch Presidency . 
when it come## s to an end , I hope to be able to say the same of the elev## en## th Luxembourg Presidency , which beg## an a few days ago . 
the experience of our pre## vi## ous preside## ncies might in## de## ed prove to be valu## able , but preside## ncies come and go and have different character## istic## s . 
when I was President of the Council of Minister## s for the first time , in 19## 85 , there we## re ten Member## s of the European Comm## un## ities ; when I was President in 19## 91 , there we## re 12 minister## s a## round the table ; when I took over the Presidency in 19## 97 , there we## re fifteen of us , and now there are 25 Member State## s . 
in 20 year## s the number of Member State## s ha## s more th## an double## d . 
the decision @## -## @ making system ha## s natural## ly become more complic## ated . 
what a joy and a pleas## ure , how## ever , to see the countries of East## ern and C## ent## ral Europe take the## ir place in the EU , in view of the f## ate## ful decree that s## ought to drive a wedge between us for ever . 
the experience of our vari## ous preside## ncies and of observ## ing the success## ive preside## ncies of other countries ha## s taught me two thing## s . 
first## ly , the EU will not genuine## ly move forward if th## ose holding the Presidency place the## ir own national interest## s at the heart of the## ir concern## s ra## ther th## an re## plac## ing them with the common interest , the best definition of the interest## s of every## one . 
it follow## s that the EU will not find genuine coher## ence , let al## one harmon## y , un## less we all respect the spirit and the letter of the Comm## un## ity method and the balance between the three institution## s . 
the Commission is not a touch judge s## ole## ly in charge of monitor## ing compliance with the rule## s of the internal market . 
it should be the play## maker , the inspir## ation and the driv## ing force of the team . 
the Council , for it## s part , is not the field of play of exclus## ive## ly national interest## s , how## ever just## ified th## ose may be , but ra## ther a work## shop of understand## ing . 
the place of Parliament , for it## s part , is not that of a spec## tator watch## ing from the stand## s . 
it is an actor with privilege## d status be## cause it is legitim## ised by universal suff## rage . 
you will , there## fore , see me regular## ly in your office## s , in your meet## ing## s and in your corridor## s in Bru## ssels and Strasbourg . 
I say this for my## self , for my minister## s and for all th## ose who work in the service of Parliament , and thu## s in your service . 
together we must oversee the rat## ification of the new Constitution## al Treat## y in the right conditio## ns . 
it is tru## e that the draft Constitution is not perfect , but we must not benchmark it again## st perfect## ion ; we must benchmark it again## st what Europe will need in order to remain an ex## ample to the world in the futur## e . 
let us do now what must be done in order for this to be the case in the futur## e and let us rat## ify the Treat## y . 
let us not forget that the Treat## y is a text that is of n## either the left nor the right . 
it## s content will be the fruit of our convict## ions , of our will and of our ambit## ion . 
if our will and our ambit## ion are perfect , the implement## ation of the new Treat## y , which may be im## perfect in the## ory , will prob## ably be perfect## ly success## ful in practice . 
the rat## ification of the Treat## y will not be an e## asy task every## where , and I have one major concern in this regard : let us not use the potent## ial difficult## ies of the parliament## ary rat## ification## s and refer## endum## s as an excus## e to slacken the pace of action or to avoid making decision## s . 
let us not put off the most difficult decision## s until the day after the first refer## endum , th## en until the day after the second refer## endum , th## en until the day after the thir## d refer## endum , and s## o on . 
when we ask for the approval of the people## s and the parliament## s of Europe , let us show them that Europe work## s , that Europe is on the move , that Europe is decisive and that Europe is cap## able of fulfill## ing it## s respons## ibil## ities . 
if the EU take## s decisive action it can win over the doubt## ers ; if it is in## active it can put doubt## s in the mind## s of th## ose pre## vi## ously convince## d . 
Mr President , when the new Presidency take## s up it## s du## ties there is usual## ly a solemn atmosphere , but that ha## s be## en over## shadow## ed this year by the terr## ible trage## dy of the sea## quake in South @## -## @ east Asia . 
the deep## ly distress## ing picture## s of the dead , the injur## ed and the de## vast## ation cast a giant shadow over the end of 20## 04 and the begin## ning of 20## 05 . 
this trage## dy will ling## er long in the memor## y and I hope that , in add## ition to the im## mediate emerge## ncy aid , we s## hall show last## ing solid## arity with the devastate## d people## s and region## s of Asia . 
I should also like us to ensu## re that the mis## ery that we are see## ing in Asia today does not make us turn our back## s on the p## over## ty , the under## development , the hung## er and the death of innoc## ent people else## where . 
our heart## s should be in place## s where the tele## vision camera## s are no long## er or have n## ever be## en . 
Mr President , the European securit## y strate## gy encourag## es us to promot## e peace , demo## cracy and st## ability in the fight again## st the root cause## s of in## securit## y in the world . 
it is absolut## e## ly cruc## ial that , in a coherent and co## ordinate## d fashion , we use the entire range of EU instrument## s in the Western Balkan## s , in the Middle East , in our relation## s with Russia and Ukraine and in our trans## atlantic relation## s . 
the futur## e of the Balkan## s , a region s## till traumat## ised by it## s re## cent past , must form part of Europe &apos;## s out## look . 
the open## ing of access## ion negoti## ations with Croatia in Mar## ch 20## 05 , provid## ed that there ha## s be## en confirm## ation of complete co## operation with the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslav## ia , will demonst## rate to all Balkan countries that the## ir ef## fort## s to## ward## s demo## cracy will be reward## ed and might bear more fruit . 
for the other countries in the region , the EU &apos;## s general action frame## work will continu## e to fall under the guide## line## s of the Thessa## loniki Ag## enda , which set## s out the European perspective present## ed to the Balkan countries . 
the Presidency will hold talk## s with Albania on a stabilis## ation and associ## ation agree## ment . 
a further cruc## ial mile## stone in the region will be a review in mid @## -## @ 20## 05 of the implement## ation of the standard## s policy in Kosovo . 
we s## hall be pay## ing close attention to the develop## ing situ## ation in Kosovo . 
I am of the opinion that , what## ever it## s status , Kosovo &apos;## s futur## e rest## s with## in the EU . 
the Russia## n Fede## ration is a strategic partner of the EU and remain## s a major factor in European securit## y and st## ability . 
admitted## ly , the state of our relation## s is not satisfactory at the moment . 
I s## hall do all that I can to reme## dy this state of affair## s , whi## lst remain## ing firm on our core demand## s . 
I trust I can count on your support in this endeavour . 
at the EU @## -## @ Russia Summit in Mos## cow on 10 May , the Presidency will striv## e for a balance## d package as regard## s the Four Common S## pace## s set out at the St Peter## s## burg Summit , which are bas## ed on common value## s and share## d interest## s . 
the EU will forge close ties with the new President of Ukraine , not least in area## s s## uch as the implement## ation of the European Neighbour## hood Poli## cy . 
we have every interest in having a s## table and prosper## ous Ukraine as a neighbour , a Ukraine that is strong## ly root## ed in demo## cracy , a Ukraine that is commit## ted to the path of modern## isation . 
the Presidency will prepar## e thorough## ly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place d## uring the Unit## ed K## ing## dom Presidency . 
I s## hall now turn to trans## atlantic relation## s . 
for the world to be a s## table place , it need## s a trans## atlantic partner## ship that work## s . 
at the moment , trans## atlantic relation## s are not bad , but nor are the## y particular## ly good . 
leav## ing matter## s as the## y are , how## ever , is not an opt## ion that will satisf## y expect## ations on bo## th side## s of the Atlantic . 
con## sequent## ly , we must improve the qual## ity of relation## s in the best interest## s of bo## th part## ies . 
we s## hall do this at the two Summit## s with President Bush - the first in Fe## bru## ary , at the US President &apos;## s re## quest , and the second in Ju## ne . 
we s## hall not focus on the differ## ence## s of opinion that some of us may have had with the Unit## ed State## s in the re## cent past , but we s## hall try to put the emphasis on a s## eries of practical question## s to which we must give equal## ly practical answer## s . 
trans## atlantic relation## s would not be complete with## out Can## ada , and I am de## light## ed that there is to be a summit with Can## ada d## uring my Presidency , in which we s## hall be discuss## ing matter## s of share## d import## ance between friend## s . 
the same appli## es , on the other side of the world , to our Ja## pan## ese friend## s . 
at this point , Mr President , I should like to say a word about the Middle East . 
with the elect## ion of President Abba## s on 9 Janu## ary as head of the Palestinian Author## ity , and with the prospect of the Israel## i withdraw## al from the Gaz## a S## trip , a window of opportun## ity ha## s open## ed up to re## launch the peace process and to speed up the implement## ation of the road map . 
that opportun## ity must now be seize## d . 
again## st this back## drop , I should like to offer my support to the Middle East conference due to take place in London in Mar## ch 20## 05 . 
this , I am s## ure , will represent an essential step to## ward## s con## solid## ating the peace process . 
under the Luxembourg Presidency , the process of EU enlarge## ment will be guide## d by the decision## s take## n by the European Council of last Dec## ember . 
we s## hall be open## ing access## ion negoti## ations with Tur## key in Mar## ch . 
as regard## s Bulgaria and Roman## ia , I hope that Parliament will issue it## s assent in April on the access## ion of th## ose two countries , which will en## able us to sign access## ion Treat## ies , also in April . 
Mr President , we can## not bring the EU close## r to it## s citizen## s if we remain in## cap## able of meet## ing the## ir just## ifiable expect## ations as regard## s internal securit## y . 
the new Constitution## al Treat## y pave## s the way to## ward## s definitive## ly abolish## ing the &apos; Just## ice and Home Affair## s except## ion , &quot; in other word## s the complete integration of this field in## to the European Project by mean## s of the rigor## ous application of the Comm## un## ity method . 
under our Presidency , justice and home affair## s activities will be in line with this perspective , and our work## ing bas## is will fall with## in the frame## work of the excel## lent Ha## gue Pro## gramme , adopt## ed by the Council in N## ov## ember of last year . 
in order to ensu## re that the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice become## s a re## ality , we must think European be## fore we think national . 
we must ensu## re that a European securit## y culture is develop## ed . 
this is a particular## ly import## ant require## ment as regard## s the fight again## st serious and organise## d crime . 
driv## ing forward the area of free## dom , securit## y and justice is in our view an essential , even exist## ent## ial , task . 
we must first , how## ever , optim## ise operation## al co## operation between the Member State## s ; for ex## ample , we must ensu## re that inform## ation can be exchange## d quick## ly and smooth## ly between Member State## s &quot; police force## s and judic## iaries . 
this principle of avail## ability will constitut## e a major step forward in co## operation between police force## s and the Presidency will set about this task at the ear## liest opportun## ity . 
we also wish to strength## en the European judicial area , which is bas## ed on bo## th mutual recogn## ition and the approx## im## ation of law## s . 
we s## hall ensu## re , in particular , that negoti## ations are d## riven forward on the European evidence warrant and on the possible establish## ment of a European criminal record . 
this will make European securit## y strong## er and will not be to the detriment of public free## dom## s , nor must it be , since th## ose free## dom## s form part of the European way of coexist## ence . 
the fight again## st terrorism must be a per## man## ent priorit## y . 
in this regard , I wish to salut## e the S## pan## ish initiative to host a meet## ing of the Head## s of State or Govern## ment in Madrid in Mar## ch . 
the Presidency , for it## s part , will place particular emphasis on combat## ing the financ## ing of terrorism . 
as far as the strand of asy## lum and im## migration is concern## ed , the Presidency will focus on three element## s : strength## ening partner## ships with countries of origin and of transit ; establish## ing a harmon## ised approach with regard to the policy of return and read## mission ; and the European Ag## ency for the manage## ment of operation## al co## operation at the external border## s begin## s it## s du## ties on 1 May . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , we often refer - and right## ly s## o - to the Europe of the citizen## s . 
let us not be under any illusion## s . 
if we do not succeed in making the EU an area of work and well @## -## @ be## ing for all , the citizen## s will become alien## ated from Europe , from it## s Union and from the political project that under## pin## s it . 
in order to stav## e off that risk and to give Europe back it## s economic and social place , we launch## ed the Lisbon Strategy al## most f## ive year## s ago . 
we want## ed - and we s## till want - to make the EU the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed econom## y in the world , cap## able of sustain## ed economic grow## th , with more and better job## s and great## er social cohes## ion , and one that respect## s the environment and natural resource## s . 
after f## ive year## s of qualified success , the time ha## s come for a mid @## -## @ term review , which we s## hall draw up for the spring European Council . 
the first task will be to clar## ify the aim of the strate## gy that we are to pursu## e . 
the Lisbon Strategy - a name that , to my mind , mean## s absolut## e## ly nothing to most people - is in fact a strate## gy for competitive## ness , grow## th , social cohes## ion and the protection of the environment . 
it should be bas## ed on solid found## ations of sustain## able well @## -## @ be## ing for European## s . 
we must act now in order , in the futur## e , to guarantee access for all to the European social model , which must not be turn## ed in## to a myth , but should remain , or ra## ther , should return to be## ing , a liv## ing re## ality for all . 
if we want to keep the European social model in## tact , it must be reform## ed s## o that it can provid## e a respons## e to the grow## th cris## is , to under @## -## @ employ## ment , to the weaken## ing of the fabric of soci## ety , to the los## s of competitive## ness and product## ivity , to the fall## ing birth @## -## @ rate and to the age## ing of our population## s . 
natural## ly , European## s do not like reform## s ; the## y are scar## ed by them and do not understand the reason## s be## hind them . 
we must explain to them that the reform## s that we are propos## ing are intend## ed to guarantee the surviv## al and the vi## ability of the European social model . 
we must convince them that put## ting off th## ose reform## s would prove more expensive . 
we must prove to them that we are right to act and would be wrong to do nothing . 
the bottom line is that we need to re## invigorate Europe . 
the next step , when we draw up the mid @## -## @ term review , is to keep together the three pillar## s of the Strategy - the economic , the social and the environment## al . 
I am well aware that Europe ha## s a competitive## ness problem , which large## ly explain## s it## s mediocr## e perform## ance in term## s of grow## th and job## s . 
of course competitive## ness must be step## ped up . 
it is not , how## ever , an end in it## self , nor some neutral , self @## -## @ sufficient benefit . 
no , the competitive## ness that we must seek should provid## e us with strong## er and more sustain## able grow## th and should be aim## ed at great## er social cohes## ion and a more harmon## ious## ly @## -## @ balance## d environment . 
pleas## e let us not start a fool## ish and point## less debate over whet## her we should have more competitive## ness and thu## s less social cohes## ion , or more social , and less environment## al , cohes## ion . 
if Europe wish## es to be strong , it need## s three thing## s , and th## ose three thing## s go together : great## er competitive## ness , great## er social cohes## ion and a better @## -## @ balance## d natural environment . 
I say y## es to competitive## ness ; I say no to giving up our social and eco## logical ambit## ions . 
I say y## es , for ex## ample , to open## ing up service market## s , but I say no to social dump## ing , an element that some people would like to promot## e . 
the bottom line , Mr President , is that we must find the right way of ens## uring that the strate## gy is success## ful . 
after f## ive year## s of chart## ing a rudder## less course between success and fail## ure , it is not s## o much a matter of know## ing what we must do - be## cause after all we do know - it is more a matter of know## ing how we are to go about it . 
it is essential that we make the European learn## ing area a re## ality , step up the research ef## fort , improve our educ## ation system## s and foster life## long learn## ing . 
this is what we must do , but how do we go about it ? 
we have far too man## y process## es in Europe . 
we have the broad economic policy guide## line## s , the employ## ment guide## line## s , the sustain## able development strate## gy , the internal market strate## gy , the small and medium @## -## @ s## ized business charter , the Co## log## ne process , the Card## iff process , and man## y other## s . 
all too often , these process## es become bog## ged down in bureaucrat## ic procedure## s that lead no## where . 
the EU is more like a research unit - a unit of un## us## ed research , at that - th## an a factor## y of idea## s that are practical and are put in## to practice . 
we must change this by stream## lining our strate## gy . 
our strate## gy is essential## ly European , but it## s implement## ation must first be national . 
we should like this strate## gy to remain essential## ly European . 
it must be subject to a broad review every two year## s , or prefer## ably every three year## s . 
we can## not change strate## gy every six month## s , from Council to Council , accord## ing to the whim## s of the preside## ncies and to what is inspir## ing them at the time . 
the strate## gy must be there for the long haul . 
we should like implement## ation at national level to be speed## ed up and step## ped up . we are propos## ing that Member State## s should set up action programme## s at national level . 
these should be design## ed in con## junction with the social partner## s and must be present## ed to national parliament## s , which , a## long with the Comm## un## ity bodies , would monitor the## ir implement## ation . 
these national programme## s would take account of the particular national and regional character## istic## s and should provid## e the possibil## ity for assess## ing the pace and intens## ity of the respect## ive national reform## s separat## e## ly and should make it easi## er to gauge the level of perform## ance achiev## ed up to a give## n point . 
s## o much for the strate## gy and the way in which it is to be implement## ed . 
we s## hall discuss this matter again together , Parliament , the Council and bo## th of us with the Commission , which will s## oon present it## s summa## ry report to us . 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the partial re## orient## ation of the Lisbon Strategy also invit## es us to reflect on the G## row## th and St## ability Pact . 
I beg your pardon , the St## ability and G## row## th Pact ! 
actual## ly , I would have prefer## red it the other way round . 
y## et as Europe was govern## ed in 19## 96 by our old friend## s - and not the one## s you would think ! - the second order was the one that was kept . 
we beg## an a review of the Pact under the Dutch Presidency and we should like to conclude it under the Luxembourg Presidency . 
we are going to reform the Pact , or ra## ther , to adjust it## s implement## ing measure## s . 
let me explain this by first detail## ing what we are not going to do . 
economic and Mon## et## ary Union need## s st## ability . 
we there## fore have no intention of driv## ing st## ability away , n## either in what we say nor in what we do . 
st## ability is a found## ing element of the pact that form## s the bas## is of the euro . 
we promise## d a s## table curr## ency . 
it will remain s## table and it will remain strong . 
it follow## s - let me say right away - that the Presidency will not propos## e to neutral## ise or immun## ise certain categor## ies of budget## ary spend## ing appli## cable under the Pact . 
it follow## s that the basic crite## ria - 3 % for the de## ficit , 60 % for the debt - will remain appli## cable . 
it is clear to me , how## ever , that change## s must be ma## de , not least in order that the Pact can take better account of the economic cycle . 
d## uring time## s of strong economic grow## th , Member State## s in the euro zone must , as a matter of priorit## y , be require## d to allocate budget surplus## es to re## duc## ing the debt and the de## ficit . 
we s## hall enrich the prevent## ative element of the Pact by mean## s of a strong dose of extra st## ability . 
d## uring time## s of weak grow## th , on the other hand , Member State## s in the euro zone should be give## n more re## active room for manoeuvr## e as regard## s the budget . 
the great## er the ef## fort## s to reduce the de## ficit and the debt d## uring period## s of economic expansion , the wide## r that room for manoeuvr## e . 
if , d## uring period## s of weak grow## th , a Member State incur## s an excess## ive de## ficit , this situ## ation and the con## sequenc## es ar## ising from it , not least in term## s of the tim## ing of correct## ion , will be judge## d by mean## s of object## ive measure## s of assess## ment . 
we must avoid at all cost## s arbit## rary political judgment## s that might lead to differ## ing assess## ments bas## ed on the s## ize of the country . 
from this perspective , Luxembourg is al## ways the los## er . 
Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit , we s## hall have a proper debate when the time come## s , in committee , with## out too man## y witness## es , on the compar## ison that could be ma## de between France , Germa## ny and Luxembourg as regard## s tax## ation . 
it is a debate that will be interest## ing and inform## ative for th## ose who , I must say , view Luxembourg in a some## what superficial mann## er . 
let me invit## e you to a calm debate about the Pact . 
I am war## y of extreme solution## s . 
I say no to th## ose who seek to replace st## ability with brazen , un## bridl## ed flexibil## ity , as well as to th## ose who seek to set the Pact , as it is now , in the cement of dogma . 
we need great## er st## ability and great## er flexibil## ity to take account of the economic cycle . 
Mr President , you would no doubt be surprise## d if I fail## ed to mention the debate that we are to hold on the financial perspective## s . 
in front of you , I would not wish to detail the component part## s of this - it must be s## aid - difficult dossier , be## cause your grasp of them is better th## an mine . 
I s## hall simpl## y say that the Luxembourg Presidency will do all that it can to reach an agree## ment on the financial perspective## s be## fore the end of Ju## ne . 
I am not under any illusion## s , how## ever . 
the Member State## s are current## ly entrench## ed in the## ir position## s and it will be difficult to move them from th## ose position## s in time , by which I mean now ! 
if we do not reach an agree## ment on a common position under the Luxembourg Presidency , by 1 Janu## ary 20## 07 , it will be political## ly , legisl## ative## ly and technical## ly im## possible to meet the challenge of the enlarge## d EU . 
con## sequent## ly , no institution or Member State will have any interest in play## ing extra time . 
the absence of an agree## ment in Ju## ne will not be the Presidency &apos;## s fail## ure , which is on## ly of ver## y minor interest to me , but Europe &apos;## s fail## ure . let us decide . 
let us decide quick## ly . 
let us decide now . 
we must spare Europe a long , drawn @## -## @ out debate last## ing 18 month## s or even more . 
that would cause even more disput## es and exacerb## ate the conflict## s between the Member State## s and the institution## s . 
Mr President , I am re## ly## ing on Parliament to drive forward the decision @## -## @ making process on the financial perspective## s . 
we s## hall work with you , be## cause your agree## ment is necess## ary . 
you will not be hand## ed a , I guarantee you that . 
that , Mr President , is the thrust of our programme . 
preside## ncies come and go , but fortunate## ly Europe remain## s . 
we want to serve Europe with de## termination and pass## ion , with the de## termination and the pass## ion that long distance## s and grand ambit## ions require . 
give## n the ap## plaus## e you have receiv## ed , we can expect the Luxembourg Presidency to be ver## y posit## ive . 
that is what Parliament want## s to see . 
. Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the half @## -## @ year that ha## s just beg## un will feature a s## eries of import## ant land## mark## s that will determine whet## her the EU will be able to meet the object## ive of achiev## ing a high## er level of prosper## ity , solid## arity and securit## y for the citizen## s . 
much of what the Commission may accomplish d## uring the coming year## s will be determine## d by the initial decision## s take## n d## uring this term and by our capacity to resolv## e difficult question## s and to achiev## e practical result## s . 
I should there## fore like to high## light , from the Commission &apos;## s perspective , the particular import## ance of this Luxembourg Presidency in this first half @## -## @ year of 20## 05 . 
accord## ing## ly , the Commission will table the programme for the period 20## 04 @## -## @ 20## 09 as ear## ly as 26 Janu## ary . 
we hope that the other institution## s can agree to this programme s## o that it can become not just part of the Commission &apos;## s programme , but part of the programme for the entire Union , thu## s anticip## ating the provision## s of the European Constitution , and we can th## en begin right away to work with## in the spirit of the Constitution . 
Luxembourg ha## s the respons## ibility of chair## ing the Council d## uring this cruc## ial period . 
I feel that it is a privilege for us to have Pr## ime Minister Ju## ncker as President of the Council d## uring this period , give## n hi## s in## valu## able experience as Head of Govern## ment , hi## s deep## ly @## -## @ held European convict## ion and hi## s well @## -## @ known ability to resolv## e trick## y situ## ations . 
from a personal point of view , it is a pleas## ure for me to work with my friend J## ean @## -## @ Claude Ju## ncker . 
Mr President , we have heard from the Presidency about it## s expect## ations and priorit## ies . 
let me comment brief## ly on just three of the main issue## s that will be on the age## nda of the Luxembourg Presidency ; there are man## y other## s , but I wish to concentr## ate on three . 
the first is the mid @## -## @ term review of the Lisbon Strategy . 
Europe is fac## ing ver## y import## ant challenge## s , most of which we## re al## read## y ident## ified at Lisbon 20## 00 . 
but we could say today that the challenge## s from global## isation and the age## ing of the population make even clear## er the need to adapt to increas## ing## ly difficult situ## ations . 
Europe &apos;## s prosper## ity is under threat . 
to tackle this threat we need more grow## th and more job## s . 
if we continu## e on the path of low , diminish## ing economic grow## th , we put all our poli## cies at risk , but in particular our capacity to ensu## re solid## arity and securit## y and to pre## serve and improve the European model . 
as out## line## d in the Kok report , to be more effective the Lisbon priorit## ies need to be re## focus## ed , stream## line## d and priorit## ised . 
too man## y priorit## ies mean## s no priorit## y at all . 
grow## th and job## s must be our priorit## ies . 
the Commission is work## ing on a report which will present it## s view## s on the mid @## -## @ term review of the Lisbon Strategy and propos## e guide## line## s for futur## e action . 
at this point in the prepar## ation of this report , two element## s strike me as particular## ly consensual . 
the first is the knowledge econom## y . 
return## ing to grow## th will require consider## able invest## ment in knowledge . 
comp## an## ies can## not become more competitive with## out a better @## -## @ prepar## ed labour force . on## ly well @## -## @ train## ed people can ensu## re high product## ivity . 
this require## s unprecedented ef## fort in the area## s of research , development , educ## ation and train## ing . 
particular ef## fort will be require## d to involve young people in this invest## ment for knowledge . 
high## er product## ivity should lead to high## er grow## th , which , in turn , would creat## e more job## s . 
I do not see knowledge pur## e## ly as an instrument for other object## ive## s : knowledge in it## self is an import## ant go## al and a vehicle for self @## -## @ realis## ation . 
the second consensual point I can under## line at this s## tage is about coher## ence in implement## ation , the deliver## y problem . 
the coher## ence between national action## s and European action is a critical factor for success . 
this mean## s better implement## ation of the object## ive## s agree## d in common , which , in turn , mean## s more respons## ibility and more empower## ment at national level to deliver the common object## ive## s . 
in this ve## in , the Commission report will also high## light clear## ly the import## ance of ens## uring owner## ship of the revise## d Lisbon Strategy by the Member State## s . 
all in all , I must stress that the mid @## -## @ term review of the Lisbon Strategy is , first , an age## nda for modern## isation . 
whet## her we will succeed depend## s on our ability to establish an effective partner## ship between our institution## s and citizen## s to deliver this reform . 
I should now like to present to you our view of the financial perspective## s . 
the Luxembourg Presidency ha## s right## ly decide## d to put every## thing in## to striv## ing to reach an agree## ment on the financial perspective## s be## fore the end of Ju## ne 20## 05 . 
it is right to do s## o , be## cause fail## ure to reach an agree## ment in time will lead to significant difficult## ies for the prepar## ation of the programme## s concern## ed . 
it strike## s me as import## ant , how## ever - at a time when a final negoti## ation might get under## way - to point out certain s## al## ient fact## s . 
we can## not have more Europe with few## er financial resource## s . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al ha## s not fall## en out of the sky ; it is the result of commit## ments agree## d by the EU d## uring the European Council## s . 
now## a## days , the Commission does not ask that the Union be grant## ed fund## ing for new project## s , but usual## ly that it be grant## ed fund## ing for commit## ments al## read## y ma## de ; Member State## s must honour the commit## ments that the## y have al## read## y ma## de . 
I should like , if I may , to point out certain issue## s on which I feel that the Union must not compromis## e . 
the first of these is cohes## ion . 
lad## ies and gentle## men , with## out solid## arity there is no Union . 
there might be some## thing else , but not a Union . 
enlarge## ment ha## s had a far @## -## @ reach## ing impact on solid## arity . 
the Union ha## s new region## s lagg## ing be## hind in development , and some of the less prosper## ous old region## s s## till need support . 
financial solid## arity is there## fore all the more necess## ary give## n that region## s lagg## ing be## hind in development have the great## est s## cope for grow## th in competitive## ness and job creation . 
we must not disappoint the new EU Member## s , which have the right to active solid## arity from the entire Union . 
second## ly , we must not forget the question of competitive## ness . 
with regard to the Lisbon Strategy , I s## aid that mass## ive invest## ment in research and educ## ation was essential . 
in## de## ed , European level expend## iture ver## y often bring## s more reward th## an national level expend## iture with## out coher## ence . 
I should also add trans @## -## @ European network## s to the list of priorit## ies , give## n that the infra## structure that connect## s Europe is s## till in decline . 
the thir## d cruc## ial aspect of the financial perspective## s is that of securit## y . 
the action programme agree## d at the European Council ha## s major financial implic## ations . 
the programme known as the &apos; Ha## gue Pro## gramme &quot; ha## s financial implic## ations . 
this mean## s more action at European level s## o that the financial burden and collect## ive securit## y can be share## d better a## mong the Member State## s . 
the citizen## s of Europe expect us to have the ability to work together . 
one Member State on it## s own , even the most power## ful , can## not guarantee the best possible securit## y if it does not form part of a joint , European @## -## @ level ef## fort . 
the bottom line is that we can## not have more Europe with less money . 
I hear people from time to time call## ing for a freeze on Comm## un## ity budget## s be## low the level of the 20## 06 budget . 
let us be clear on this matter : that would be a Europe that reneg## es on it## s commit## ments . 
I wish to state clear## ly that the Commission would wish to have nothing to do with a Europe of back## track## ing , a Europe of mediocr## ity , a Europe of reduce## d aim## s . 
this is why I am de## light## ed that the Luxembourg Presidency will do every## thing in it## s power to reach a compromis## e agree## ment this term . 
some people will say that this will be difficult , even un## like## ly . 
I honest## ly believ## e that the long## er we leave this , the more difficult it will be . 
we there## fore support the Luxembourg Presidency in this difficult , y## et extreme## ly import## ant , task . 
as for the St## ability and G## row## th Pact , we welcome the fact that one of the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s priorit## ies is to ensu## re that multilateral budget## ary monitor## ing will make a great## er contribut## ion to a strong , health## y and success## ful economic and monetar## y Union . 
these principle## s under## pin the St## ability and G## row## th Pact and this Pact must be respect## ed and must function proper## ly . 
let us not forget that the s## ing## le curr## ency is one of Europe &apos;## s great achiev## e## ments . 
I re## member be## fore the euro came in## to force , certain expert## s , econom## ists and profess## ors , particular## ly on the other side of the Atlantic , we## re say## ing that Europe would n## ever be able to have a strong curr## ency be## cause of it## s lack of solid## arity and political cohes## ion . 
now## a## days , some are say## ing that our curr## ency might be too strong , but not too weak . 
the s## ing## le curr## ency is there## fore an histo## ric European success story . 
we must not now jeopard## ise that great success . 
at the end of 20## 03 , the Commission initiate## d a reflect## ion process on the experience that ha## s be## en gain## ed , in order to ident## ify possible change## s and improve## ments that might help us to implement the Pact more efficient## ly . 
convince## d that the common interest command## s that every## body comp## ly with every rule , the Commission ha## s be## en in contact with the vari## ous European bodies respons## ible for think## ing together and for expl## or## ing together the most prom## ising a## venue## s , s## uch as th## ose table## d in our Communic## ation of Sept## ember 20## 04 . 
the Presidency &apos;## s contribut## ion will be instrument## al in engender## ing a con## sensus of opinion . 
we are al## read## y expect## ing s## uch a con## sensus at the Eco## fin Council on 18 Janu## ary . 
the Commission will thu## s be able to put forward practical propos## al## s to improve the implement## ation of the Pact and this in time for the discuss## ions at the European Council in Mar## ch . 
in the next six month## s , the ability of the European Union to return to grow## th will be put to the test . 
it will have to provid## e the financial mean## s necess## ary to match it## s political cho## ice## s . 
it must work close## r to citizen## s and regain the## ir trust . 
it must strength## en it## s role on the international scene and re## launch it## s strategic partner## ships . 
there is now a special opportun## ity for re## launch## ing the Middle East peace process . 
the European Union can and should give a great## er contribut## ion in this field . 
I believ## e that the European Union will play a strong## er role on the international scene . 
the Commission strong## ly support## s the ef## fort## s of the Luxembourg preside## ncy on this path . 
the Commission believ## es that this period is critical and that our institution## s will need to work together even more close## ly to achiev## e result## s . 
. Mr President , Mr President of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , lad## ies and gentle## men , we welcome to the House today the President## s of the European Council and of the Commission , and I gather that the President of the European Council will also be present when the Commission unveil## s it## s programme in Bru## ssels on 26 Janu## ary . 
I see that as a splendid symbol for the ever @## -## @ grow## ing co## operation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission . 
futur## e preside## ncies should take that as an ex## ample to follow . 
al## though we we## re ver## y pleas## ed to see the President of the Commission and the President of the Council in Asia , visit## ing Ja## karta as an express## ion of the European Union &apos;## s solid## arity , I would like to emphasis## e that , how## ever necess## ary solid## arity with the s## trick## en area## s might be , we must not over## look the great problem## s in Africa and in other part## s of the world . 
we have to consider how we can , in s## o far as we are able , take prevent## ive measure## s , in the shape of an ear## ly warn## ing system , in Europe too , for ex## ample in the Medi## terranean . 
we are ver## y much be## hind you , Mr President of the Council , in what you had to say about the Comm## un## ity method . 
Luxembourg may well be small in geo## graphic## al term## s , but it is a Grand Du## chy and hence a great country , and the Bene## lux states &quot; preside## ncies have al## ways be## en excel## lent one## s . 
we wish you great success ; for the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s too , the Constitution is of the ut## most priorit## y . 
in Bru## ssels , we will have in @## -## @ depth discuss## ions on the Lisbon strate## gy , even though making the European econom## y competitive is not an end in it## self , for the fact is that a strong econom## y is the best guarantee of good social policy . 
we see competitive## ness as be## ing about creat## ing more job## s in Europe by way of grow## th and better conditio## ns for European business## es . 
for us , that is social policy in the tru## e sense of the word . 
ra## ther th## an setting eco## logy and the protection of the environment again## st the econom## y , we need a sens## ible balance between them . 
we also wish you and your preside## ncy success in hand## ling the financial perspective . 
to th## ose lad## ies and gentle## men - in this in## stance , no doubt , on## ly gentle## men - who wrote letter## s argu## ing in favour of the 1 % limit , we would say that you can## not enlarge Europe and th## en re## fuse the EU &apos;## s new Member State## s the money that is an express## ion of our solid## arity , and which the## y need in order to be br## ought up to our standard## s . 
to do that , we in the European Union need the necess## ary fund## ing to be ma## de avail## able . 
you have mention## ed the treat## ies that are to be sign## ed , but how , in the absence of any agree## ment by Ju## ne and of any success in medium @## -## @ term financial plan## ning , are we to cope with the access## ion of new states to the European Union ? 
we are ver## y glad that it is Rei## mer Böge , a ver## y competent member of our group , who will be writing the report for this House . 
you also ma## de reference to the St## ability Pact . 
I am ver## y grat## e## ful to you for what you s## aid , and I can agree with every word of it . 
what you s## aid boil## s down , in es## s## ence , to the need for more flexibil## ity . 
the thing about flexibil## ity is that it is th## ose states that have ma## de provision## s that have more of it . 
to come to the point , th## en , the less indebted a state is , the more flex## ible it can be when time## s are hard for the econom## y , which also mean## s that we have to do what ha## s to be done to reduce de## ficit## s when thing## s are going well for the econom## y , for we know that today &apos;## s debt## s al## ways end up be## ing tomor## row &apos;## s tax## es , and a burden on the public as a whole , particular## ly on the young## er generation . 
let me just say some## thing brief## ly about foreign policy issue## s , a number of which you have address## ed , and - as I understand it - the President of the Commission is in full agree## ment with what you s## aid . 
our support for Ukraine is on## ly just begin## ning and will have to be an on## going respons## ibility . 
if I may turn to Palestine , where elect## ions have just take## n place , we want a secure Israel and a secure Palestinian state . 
the European Union &apos;## s role must not - contr## ary to what we are told by not a few high @## -## @ rank## ing represent## ative## s from the Middle East - be mer## e## ly a matter of provid## ing financial support , but should involve us , as an honest broker , making our contribut## ion to bring## ing peace to the Middle East . 
turn## ing to trans @## -## @ Atlantic relation## s , I wish you , and of course the President of the Commission , great success with President Bush &apos;## s visit , which will usher in a new er## a of good relation## s with the Unit## ed State## s of America . 
we can## not have two group## s of states in the European Union , e## ach with it## s own way of maintain## ing relation## s with the US## A . 
we European## s must un## ite in taking up a position found## ed upon partner## ship with our American friend## s , and s## o , as you , Mr President of the Council , have s## aid , we in the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y ( Christ## ian Democrat## s ) and European Democrat## s , bring de## termination and pass## ion to support## ing you , and wish you great success in your preside## ncy . 
. - Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , the social## ists are striv## ing for a Europe of excel## lence . 
for us , the Lisbon policy constitut## es the best rout## e to## ward## s European competitive## ness , the bas## is of a good life , in## de## ed a better life , for our citizen## s . 
that is what is known as social cohes## ion . 
the EU must stop complain## ing that Europe is s## aid to be fall## ing be## hind other region## s of the world . 
if Europe we## re no long## er competitive , th## en how on earth could the Union account for the lion &apos;## s share of world trade ? 
in 20## 03 , for ex## ample , the Union account## ed for 40 % of the trade in good## s and 45 % of the trade in service## s through## out the world , more th## an the Unit## ed State## s , Ja## pan and Chi## na put together . 
of course some of our indus## tries are suffer## ing from competit## ion from countries in which s## al## aries are low , but we will not make better product## s by d## ism## ant## ling our social model . 
I should like to address the follow## ing remark## s to some conserv## ative and liberal Member## s of this House : protect## ing the right to work will provid## e workers with a sense of securit## y and even well @## -## @ be## ing . 
in other word## s , this is an import## ant factor in workers &quot; product## ivity , and , in turn , in comp## an## ies &quot; competitive## ness . 
there is no conflict , but complement## arity . 
that is a quote from Mr B## il## t## gen , the chair## man of the Luxembourg Christ## ian Soci## al Part## y , an eminent member of the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y .## .. 
President Ju## ncker lead## s a coal## ition govern## ment of the Christ## ian Soci## al Part## y and the Socialist## s , which is a benchmark by which to re## invigorate the Union on the bas## is of broad political con## sensus . 
the European Socialist## s have high hope## s for this Luxembourg Presidency , prim## arily from the point of view of re## launch## ing the Lisbon Strategy and of turn## ing it in## to a genuine instrument of progress , particular## ly at the level of the 25 . 
to this end , the macro## economic frame## work must be re## direct## ed to## ward## s a policy of grow## th and st## ability . 
st## ability is a public good that must be defend## ed in the interest## s of our poor## est citizen## s . 
there will n## ever be st## ability , how## ever , with## out strong economic grow## th . 
the St## ability and G## row## th Pact must become an instrument that provid## es a mean## s of bo## th combat## ing public de## ficit and fashion## ing an economic policy in tune with the economic cycle## s . 
fiscal disciplin## e is require## d in time## s of strong economic grow## th and more flexibil## ity d## uring period## s of re## cession . 
when it assess## es e## ach country &apos;## s public finance## s , the Commission must also assess the qual## ity of spend## ing . 
the practice of borrow## ing to finance running cost## s must be ban## ned ; borrow## ing must be confine## d to invest## ment to prepar## e for the futur## e . 
there can## not be more Europe with less money . 
a Union of 45## 5 million inhabit## ants can## not develop with a budget in 20## 05 limit## ed to 1.0## 04 % of Europe &apos;## s G## NP . 
re## launch## ing Lisbon , the &apos; intelligent &quot; St## ability and G## row## th Pact , financial perspective## s that actual## ly offer new perspective## s for Europe : these are the Her## cule## an task## s fac## ing the Luxembourg Presidency . 
at the same time , we ask the Union not to forget the neglect## ed people of the world . 
if the international communit## y is cap## able of offer## ing debt relief to Iraq of some 80 % , and if it wish## es to offer debt relief to th## ose countries hit by the ts## un## ami , it must also be cap## able of cancel## ling the debt that wip## es out any development in develop## ing world countries . 
. 
Mr President , this is the elev## en## th Luxembourg preside## ncy . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , your preside## ncy ha## s high standard## s of it## s own to live up to and the high expect## ations of other## s to meet . 
simultaneous## ly President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the European Council and of the Eco## nomic and Fin## ance Council , you are in a un## ique position from which to reach agree## ment on one of your big## gest and most delicate object## ive## s - the financial perspective## s for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
Liberal## s and Democrat## s are pleas## ed to note that in your preside## ncy programme you say that &apos; all progress to## ward## s European construct## ion require## s adequate financial resource## s &apos; . 
we hope you will not be limit## ed by dogma## tic demand## s to cap the Union &apos;## s budget at 1 % for the next deca## de . 
we are not profligate with European citizen## s &apos; tax## es and we insist that every euro be well spent and proper## ly account## ed for . 
non## e## the## less , we , too , recognis## e that the European Union ha## s just## ifiable ambit## ions , whet## her to run a coherent securit## y strate## gy , gener## ous development policy or an effective policy of regional aid and social cohes## ion . 
these all have a cost , and we should not limit our political ambit## ions by penny @## -## @ pinch## ing over what is , after all , a relativ## e## ly modest budget . 
I wish you every success in sec## uring agree## ment in Ju## ne , for I fear the approach of your success## ors in this , as in other matter## s , is un## like## ly to command a con## sensus . 
my Group will call upon you to spec## ify new arrange## ments for the St## ability and G## row## th Pact , which under## pin## s the s## ing## le curr## ency . 
as &apos; Mr Euro &apos; , it is your right and du## ty to s## peak out for the euro and the euro zone . 
if France and Germa## ny are allow## ed to escape with a mild rebuke for exceed## ing the de## ficit limit## s for sever## al consecutive year## s , if Greece is absolve## d from misrepresent## ing it## s tru## e fiscal state to gain fast @## -## @ track ent## ry to the euro , and if I## ta## ly continu## es to be reckless with it## s budget while harbour## ing a public debt of over 1## 00 % , who will have con## fidence in th## ose rule## s ? 
the St## ability Pact need## s adjust## ing but it also need## s en## forc## ing , with proper monitor## ing arrange## ments like th## ose us## ed by the IM## F . 
we will look to you and your Council colleague## s to be vigil## ant and tru## e to your commit## ments . 
your term in office will coincide with the mid @## -## @ term review of the much vaunt## ed and li## ttle respect## ed Lisbon Ag## enda . 
it is in serious danger of stall## ing . 
your commit## ment to a re## launch at this half## way mark will bear fruit if you succeed in comp## let## ing the s## ing## le market , in find## ing more fund## ing for research and in promot## ing a favour## able climate for entrepreneur## ship . 
but do not try to be all thing## s to all people . 
structural labour market reform is essential to Lisbon . 
n## either should you under## estimate the challenge of en## forc## ing exist## ing direct## ive## s . 
your propos## al to make national govern## ments account## able to the## ir peer## s , as well as to national parliament## s and public opinion , is a good one and the Commission must be entrust## ed to monitor the measure## s need## ed and not be afraid to name and shame the lagg## ard## s . 
my Group also welcome## s your commit## ment to move to the Comm## un## ity method in matter## s of justice and home affair## s s## o import## ant to our citizen## s . 
we also share your ambit## ions for enlarge## ment . 
new arriv## al## s are on the horizon . Bulgaria and Roman## ia will short## ly be join## ing us . 
Croatia is a candid## ate country with which you must open negoti## ations . 
let us be clear , as regard## s Croatia , that we expect General Got## ov## ina to hand him## self over or be turn## ed over to The Ha## gue to answer the case again## st him . 
Croatia can## not duck that issue . 
as Mr Po## ette## ring s## aid , we can## not ignor## e the moment## ous even## ts in Ukraine in the last two month## s . 
as a collect## ive body of institution## s , we must encourag## e the open## ing @## -## @ up of that country and review bilateral relation## s in the light of new circum## stance## s . 
that is a task for your preside## ncy . 
in conclusion , as the Constitution enter## s it## s rat## ification phase , you may have three refer## enda on your watch , and you must do all in your power to make s## ure the## y succeed . 
if political force## s in Spa## in are allow## ed to ra## ise the g## host of regional auto## nomy , if , in France , the debate is mud## died by Turk## ish member## ship , if , in Brit## ain , EU financ## ing become## s an issue in the Constitution## al Treat## y debate , the whole thing will come crash## ing down a## round Europe &apos;## s ear## s . 
leave th## ose issue## s where the## y belong and make s## ure Europe get## s the Constitution it need## s . 
. - Mr President , today I have just discover## ed o## nce again that Christ## ian Democrat in one country does not mean the same thing as Christ## ian Democrat in an## other country , I congratul## ate you .## .. 
the same go## es for the Green## s , but at the moment , I am address## ing the President of the Union and not the President of the European Green## s . 
that is the differ## ence , Mr Po## ette## ring ! 
you s## aid some## thing ver## y interest## ing . 
if you are actual## ly setting up a work## ing group with Mr Barros## o to look at the Lisbon process , I s## hall be ver## y interest## ed in taking part , in order to try and have every## body s## ing## ing from the same hymn @## -## @ sheet . 
in fact , we agree with you and disagree with Mr Barros## o ; competitive## ness must go hand in hand with sustain## able grow## th , with social solid## arity and environment## al respons## ibility . 
Mr Barros## o forgo## t three of these four element## s and this is why we need a work## ing group between the Commission and the Council to have every## body s## ing## ing from the same hymn @## -## @ sheet . 
we are on your side , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council . 
as regard## s the financial perspective## s , every## body is o## nce again in agree## ment . 
para## phras## ing Victor Hug## o , I should like to tell you that let## ting s## ting## y countries govern Europe is tant## amount to let## ting a hurricane govern the ocean . 
that is some## thing we do not want . 
it is ap## parent that when the hurricane govern## s the ocean , every## thing collapse## s . 
if the s## ting## y countries - by which I mean countries and govern## ments that are ver## y close to me - prevail with the## ir 1 % , Europe will be the los## er . 
we are there## fore on your side , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , in the fight again## st any attempt## s at re## duc## ing the European budget . 
re## duc## ing the European budget is in fact tant## amount to let## ting Europe collapse . 
I should like to say one other thing - and this is ver## y import## ant - about educ## ation . 
I refer to the debate initiate## d by the Organ## isation for Eco## nomic Co## operation and Develop## ment with the Pro## gramme for Inter## national Stu## dent Assessment . 
when discuss## ing educ## ation , it is import## ant to have the courage to say what work## s and what does not work in the Member State## s . 
it is not en## ough to s## peak of the need to educate , one must also say that there are educ## ation system## s , teach## ing system## s in Europe that are counter @## -## @ productive , re## action## ary and ideo## logical . 
to conclude , I should like to say that the ten## th annivers## ary of the Day## ton agree## ment and of Srebrenica fall## s d## uring your Presidency . 
I there## fore ask Europe to take step## s to revise the Day## ton agree## ment , which might have be## en a necess## ary measure in it## s time , but which is un## accept## able in view of the Constitution now in force in Bosnia and Her## zegovina . 
con## sequent## ly , on the occasion of ten year## s since Srebrenica , I ask you , on Europe &apos;## s be## half , to take step## s to revise the Day## ton agree## ment . 
. Mr Ju## ncker , I should first of all like to thank you for your introdu## ction . 
I would like to wish the Luxembourg Presidency success , and I wish it more wisdom th## an it## s Dutch predecessor had , al## though you have al## read## y ma## de a li## ttle with your remark about the Constitution . 
I urge you to give the public the opportun## ity to make up the## ir own mind## s in a fair @## -## @ mind## ed mann## er . 
my first question to you is a short one . 
it was six year## s ago that the euro was introduce## d . 
at the time , in 19## 99 , European un## employ## ment stood at 9 % , and ha## s remain## ed at that level to this day , while economic grow## th ha## s slow## ed down . 
my question to you is : do you not consider it high time we submit## ted the euro to a thorough over## haul , in which you , in fact , could take the lead ? 
I regret the absence from your age## nda of the continu## ation of the debate , initiate## d under the Dutch Presidency , on the control of anim## al dis## ease## s . 
had this slip## ped your mind ? 
accord## ing to your list of priorit## ies , there are man## y mis## understand## ing## s surround## ing the service## s direct## ive . 
exact## ly what kind of mis## understand## ing## s do you mean , and who , in your view , is labour## ing under them ? 
is it the Commission , Parliament or the thousand## s of workers who have al## read## y voice## d the## ir dis## approval of this service## s direct## ive ? 
from your wish to reassess the propos## al in a more object## ive light , as you describ## e it , can I deduce that you share my view that the service## s direct## ive is an extreme## ly vague document that my fellow @## -## @ country## man , Commission## er Bolk## e## stein , should n## ever even have table## d ? 
does the Luxembourg Presidency have concrete propos## al## s for amend## ing the Commission propos## al on the service## s direct## ive ? 
if not , I would invit## e you to travel with me through the N## ether## land## s . 
you would be able to get to know th## ose import## ant public service## s , s## uch as educ## ation and health care , that the direct## ive put## s in jeopard## y . 
I could also introduce you to th## ose commercial service provid## ers , including the coffee shop &apos; De T## ev## re## den Ro## ker &apos; &#91; The S## ati## s## fi## ed Smo## ker &#93; and the &apos; P## ic## ob## ello E## s## cor## t Service &apos; club , which would certain## ly be keen to become active in Luxembourg , or else## where for that matter . 
to my mind , service## s of that kind are express## ions of Dutch culture and thank## s to the service## s direct## ive , we will be able to inflict them on every## one . 
you will gather that these last word## s we## re mean## t as a pro## vocation , but I should like to ask you in all serious## ness to take me up on my invit## ation . 
we may th## en be able to have the despe## rate## ly need## ed debate about the service## s direct## ive , which seem## s to be absent in too man## y cruc## ial place## s in Europe . 
. 
Mr President , Mr Ju## ncker &apos;## s speech was ma## de with all the pass## ion that a civil serv## ant is like## ly to ra## ise . 
Mr Ju## ncker , you say that the St## ability and G## row## th Pact will be your top priorit## y , but your past statement## s serve to illust## rate on## ly the inconsiste## ncies . 
whi## lst I acknowledg## e that you play## ed a key role in negoti## ating the pact &apos;## s origin## al rule## s , you re## cent## ly s## aid that the cred## ibility of the pact had be## en buried and that the pact was dead . 
is that s## till your opinion ? 
you also s## aid that you have a window of opportun## ity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget , including the Brit## ish re## bate of some EUR 4 billion a year . 
is that s## o , Mr Ju## ncker ? 
the re## bate took to negotiate . 
if your comment## s are tru## e and you can cut a deal by Ju## ne , th## en Mr Blair must have agree## d in principle to surrender the re## bate . 
is that the case ? 
with whom in the Brit## ish Govern## ment precise## ly are you negoti## ating ? 
will the Brit## ish elector## ate know about this at the time of the Brit## ish general elect## ion , prob## ably in May ? 
final## ly , the UK In## depend## ence Part## y , and in particular my colleague Mr Far## age , ha## s drawn attention to the criminal activities of more th## an one Commission## er . 
more detail## s will follow short## ly and regular## ly . 
are you to be taint## ed by associ## ation with them , or will you be express## ing your concern## s and the press## ing need for change ? 
. - Mr President , the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s programme is pack## ed with cruc## ial issue## s for the futur## e of Europe , including the priorit## ies on the economic front : the Lisbon strate## gy , reform of the St## ability Pact and approval of the financial perspective up to 20## 13 . 
my first point is that it will s## oon be time for the mid @## -## @ term review of the level of implement## ation of the Lisbon strate## gy . 
to give it a great## er chance of success , the programme need## s to make the individual Member State## s respons## ible for achiev## ing the target## s that we## re set . 
to that end , I consider the propos## al to spec## ify an individual at national level to be respons## ible for put## ting the strate## gy in## to practice to be a ver## y use## ful idea . 
second## ly , with regard to the review of the St## ability Pact , it ha## s also be## en emphasis## ed this morning that a reform is need## ed which can propos## e a more flex## ible interpret## ation of the Pact d## uring time## s of re## cession , with## out bypass## ing the Maas## tri## cht crite## ria and with## out giving up the commit## ment to reduce the debt . 
I am also convince## d that step## s could be take## n to exclude certain specific type## s of invest## ment from the calcul## ation of the de## ficit in order to give a new boost to Europe &apos;## s grow## th and competitive## ness . 
t## hirdly , I hope that we can re## ally succeed in ap## prov## ing the financial perspective up to 20## 13 by Ju## ne , s## o that the resource## s can be us## ed to the full from the ver## y begin## ning of the period in question . 
I e## special## ly hope that the propos## al## s - the Council &apos;## s and the Commission &apos;## s propos## al## s on th## ose import## ant topic## s - are adequate## ly discuss## ed in advance by Parliament which , let us recall , is the on## ly European institution that direct## ly represent## s the sovereign## ty of the people . 
last## ly , I hope that a European civil protection age## ncy will at last be set up d## uring the Luxembourg Presidency s## o that natural disaster## s can be deal## t with in an appropriate mann## er , with particular emphasis on prevent## ion . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , there are man## y in this House who have , for some time , be## en keen to see you s## itt## ing opposite where you are now , and I am one of them . 
the work programme you have present## ed is enormous , but you also have a re## put## ation for work## ing wonder## s , and it is to the wonder @## -## @ work## er in you that I would like to appeal , ask## ing you also to give attention to the Member## s &quot; statute . 
we ur## gent## ly need a fair and cred## ible statute of this kind . 
some## where between your country and mine is to be found not on## ly the problem , but also the solution to it . 
we are told that the Germa## n Govern## ment does not want one be## fore the next elect## ions , but , at the same time , the Germa## n model - as regard## s Member## s &quot; remune## ration ra## ther th## an additional earn## ing## s and lobby## ists - could serve as a bas## is for an agree## ment of this kind . 
we have to put a stop to the un## worthy gre## ed in this place . 
this House must cease to be a parliament of the in## s## ati## able , or else serious damage will be done to demo## cracy , which is what this place is all about . 
if the President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council does not wish to re## ply to the ver## y specific and precise question## s that have just be## en put to him , we s## hall continu## e with the debate . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , lad## ies and gentle## men , Luxembourg &apos;## s Presidency of the Council in this first half of 20## 05 is ver## y prob## ably the last of it## s kind that we s## hall see . 
under the European Constitution , by the time my country is next in line to take it## s turn in the preside## ncy , the preside## ncy of the Council of Head## s of State or Govern## ment will have be## en per## man## ent## ly reform## ed . 
it follow## s that a last preside## ncy - which is what this one is - must be a good one , and one who## s## e success## es will stand the test of time . 
the big## gest and most difficult task## s for our 20## 05 preside## ncy have to do with finance policy ; it## s age## nda is dominate## d by the de## termination of the financial frame## work for the period from 20## 07 to 20## 13 and by a more flex## ible interpret## ation of the St## ability and G## row## th Pact . 
the financial frame## work for the enlarge## d Union must be negotiate## d in s## uch a way that an ambitious approach to the s## hap## ing of European policy is not obstruct## ed by budget## ary constrain## ts at national level . 
Europe &apos;## s 4## 50 million inhabit## ants expect the European Union to be able to take effective action , and we will not be meet## ing the## ir expect## ations by disput## ing over ten## th## s and hundred## th## s of per## cent## age point## s , s## o it is vital that the Luxembourg Presidency should make a success of the trick## y feat of giving the EU &apos;## s financial plan## ning a European dimension . 
in s## o do## ing , it will be acting in the interest## s of every European and of a Union that is not on## ly enlarg## ing it## self but also , and at the same time , benefit## ing it## s citizen## s by put## ting it## s poli## cies on an adequate and appropriate financial foot## ing , fail## ing which further round## s of enlarge## ment will be quit## e beyond it## s capacities . 
d## uring the coming six month## s , Europe &apos;## s St## ability and G## row## th Pact is to be re## interpret## ed in line with the economic situ## ation . 
it is in fact economic good sense , as well as the demand## s of a dynamic employ## ment policy in Europe , that require that it be adapt## ed to take account of the real## ities of the grow## th cycle . 
the fact is that the Pact is about grow## th as well as st## ability , and excess## ive rigid## ity must not be allow## ed to hamper grow## th ra## ther th## an promot## e it . 
the Lisbon strate## gy face## s it## s mid @## -## @ term review on 22 Mar## ch of this year , when what ha## s be## en achiev## ed s## o far will be assess## ed and new priorit## ies set . 
the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council propos## es that , by 20## 10 , every Member State should have set in motion tang## ible and demonst## r## able reform## s in every one of the area## s in which the Lisbon strate## gy require## s action . 
that having be## en s## aid , the EU &apos;## s economic environment will also under## go change## s over the next f## ive year## s . 
Europe is not al## one in the world in striv## ing to improve it## s perform## ance and become more competitive , and s## o the Lisbon reform age## nda will have to be success## fully implement## ed by 20## 10 . 
the Luxembourg Presidency is well aware of that , and will endeavour to ensu## re that it## s announce## ment is follow## ed up by a s## tage in which progress is actual## ly ma## de . 
final## ly , it matter## s a great deal to me that some## thing should be s## aid , in this debate , on the epoch @## -## @ making even## ts in Ukraine , which is a European state , one that ha## s , in the last month , demonst## rated it## s desir## e to be one of us , and it## s ability to enrich the European fami## ly with it## s convict## ions and it## s experience . 
if it should be under Luxembourg &apos;## s Presidency that a start is ma## de on comp## let## ing the map of Europe , we should bear in mind that Slovak## ia , Po## land , Hung## ary and Roman## ia have a neighbour who## s## e people see the## ir futur## e as be## ing a## long## side all of us in Europe . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , let me just start with a brief comment . 
I see the statute as too import## ant an issue to be a play## thing for demagogu## es , and s## o I would ask you to ignor## e the rab## ble @## -## @ rous## ing utter## ance## s that have be## en ma## de and go a## head with what you plan to do with all your strength and in earnest , address## ing this issue and find## ing a solution to it . 
your speech , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , was a ver## y good one , and I would like to congratul## ate you on get## ting the right balance between the econom## y and soci## ety and particular## ly on giving priorit## y to employ## ment and grow## th . 
if I may be frank , that is an ex## ample to man## y , and not just to Christ## ian Democrat Head## s of Govern## ment . 
I would , though , also like to endorse what you s## aid about the foreign policy aspect## s . 
two countries in our vici## n## ity - Ukraine and Palestine - have held import## ant elect## ions in re## cent week## s . 
in bo## th in## stance## s , the European Union play## ed a ver## y active part in bring## ing about change through democratic , open and trans## parent elect## ions , and Europe must , as you s## aid , hang on in there . 
we must not disappoint the people whom we have , to some degree , motivate## d to summon up the courage to bring about change## s , and whom we have help## ed to do s## o in a trans## parent mann## er . 
do not let your## self be discourag## ed , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , for you are quit## e right to say that the development we are promot## ing and support## ing in Ukraine is not a development in op## position to Russia , but we must n## ever## the## less try to work together with Russia to## ward## s find## ing solution## s . 
Ukraine must not become the ball in a game of power politic## s play## ed by the European Union and Russia . 
Russia must of course acknowledg## e that there have be## en change## s that it may find disagree## able , but which the people them## selves have cho## s## en . 
we## re these change## s now to be pursu## ed to some degree in op## position to Russia , it would not be in Ukraine &apos;## s interest## s , for it is too vari## ed and too divers## ified , and we know that it is th## ose part## s that are to some ex## tent align## ed with Russia that are Ukraine &apos;## s economic power## house## s . 
similar## ly , in Palestine , we need to remain involve## d and to continu## e giving political moral and financial support , as we have done for year## s , whi## lst al## ways taking a critical line when it could not be clear## ly show## n where the money was flow## ing . 
we have br## ought about man## y change## s and introduce## d a degree of trans## par## ency , including in the way Palestine is administ## er## ed . 
that is what we have achiev## ed , and we will continu## e to do s## o if we get s## tuck in and , as ha## s be## en s## aid , do not limit our## selves to supply## ing fund## s but also help the Palestinian people to gain a state of the## ir own . 
the on## ly way to guarantee securit## y in the Middle East is for there to be bo## th an Israel that is secure with## in it## s own border## s and also a new Palestinian state . 
even if foreign policy is not one of your preside## ncy &apos;## s priorit## ies from the word go , we can## not desert the people whom we have help## ed to bring about change ; it is also in our own interest , in the interest## s of st## ability and our own continent , that we should help them to## ward## s the real political go## al . 
Mr President , I welcome the preside## ncy and congratul## ate it on it## s priorit## ies . 
I have four question## s . 
the EU face## s ver## y consider## able challenge## s d## uring the next six month## s . 
natural## ly , the half @## -## @ term review## of the## Lisbon process is one of the over## rid## ing issue## s . 
it is time for European leader## s to begin to act . 
I much appreci## ate the preside## ncy &apos;## s statement that economic grow## th is import## ant but that the other two pillar## s of st## ability are also need## ed , name## ly social and environment## al development . 
what , non## e## the## less , need## s to be explain## ed is not mer## e## ly the fact that you intend to improve the Lisbon process , but the way in which you intend to do this . 
the other issue concern## s the energ## y area . 
a better environment and improve## d self @## -## @ sufficiency are natural## ly ver## y import## ant and bring about economic grow## th . 
the production of bio## mass creat## es job## s in district## s and region## s with low economic grow## th and can contribut## e to a better environment and to more s## table energ## y production . 
how do you intend to combin## e the half @## -## @ term reform of agri## cultural policy with energ## y policy and industrial policy ? 
mark T## wa## in o## nce s## aid that &apos; All you need in this life is ignor## ance and con## fidence , and th## en success is s## ure . &quot; 
obvi## ously , that is not the case . 
research policy need## s to be strength## ened , and we need a knowledge @## -## @ bas## ed econom## y . 
what will the preside## ncy do to ensu## re fast## er achiev## e## ment of the 3 % target where grant## s for research are concern## ed ? 
final## ly , the four## th area . 
nothing was mention## ed about what is per## hap## s the most import## ant legisl## ative process under way , name## ly the Chem## ical## s Direct## ive , REACH . 
we have the opportun## ity to creat## e a global standard if we combin## e the Commission &apos;## s propos## al with better work## ability . 
un## certain## ty is ver## y expensive bo## th for indus## try and the environment . 
how do you intend to work with REACH ? 
final## ly , I should like to congratul## ate you on a ver## y good present## ation of the priorit## ies and hope that , d## uring the next six month## s , you will be able to achiev## e the object## ive## s you have establish## ed . 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , I am de## light## ed at the clear and courage## ous statement## s that have be## en ma## de by the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to sustain## able development policy . 
the Luxembourg Presidency , to a great## er ex## tent th## an it## s predecessor## s , is attempt## ing to maintain a balance between economic , social and environment## al poli## cies . 
it is call## ing for some## thing quit## e simpl## e , name## ly that social and environment## al poli## cies be a start## ing point and not an end go## al as far as grow## th policy is concern## ed . 
I hope that this will be the line follow## ed by the Luxembourg Presidency at the European Council and with## in the respect## ive sector## al Council## s , and I am s## ure that your propos## al## s on the main area## s of work , name## ly the Fina## ncial Perspective## s , the reform of the St## ability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process , will be guide## d by this spirit of sustain## able development . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , I also hope that you will find the energ## y to convince the European Council that Europe should continu## e to act as the driv## ing force be## hind the Kyoto process . 
after the European Union &apos;## s success with Kyoto , it is essential that it now set out a long @## -## @ term frame## work for climate change policy , with object## ive## s for the period 20## 20 @## -## @ 20## 50 . 
this is what bo## th our citizen## s and our economic play## ers expect . 
what guide## line## s will economic play## ers in Europe follow when invest## ing in key sector## s s## uch as energ## y and transport , if we have not laid down a clear frame## work for futur## e poli## cies in this field ? 
turn## ing to the Lisbon strate## gy , you not## ed that it relate## d to three area## s , name## ly environment## al , social and economic issue## s . 
it is the ambitious environment## al poli## cies of re## cent deca## de## s that have ma## de Europe a global leader in environment## al technologies and renew## able energ## ies . 
I hope that you will revise Chapter V of the Koch report to ensu## re that the European econom## y can benefit from these ambitious poli## cies . 
the Lisbon age## nda should also include an ambitious social policy . 
the Commission is press## ing for extens## ive liberal## isation , in particular as propos## ed in the Bolk## enstein direct## ive , and I am glad that you have express## ed critic## ism of this direct## ive , Mr Ju## ncker . 
I hope that the Luxembourg Presidency will also take advantage of critic## ism## s from with## in the Com## pet## itive## ness Council to hold a debate on this direct## ive , and , if necess## ary , to check it## s progress , as well as to force the Commission to table a direct## ive on service## s of general interest . 
I believ## e that con## fusion will reign over the Bolk## enstein direct## ive until the issue of service## s of general interest ha## s be## en clar## ified . 
I ver## y much welcome the fact that this preside## ncy aim## s to harmon## ise social , environment## al and economic poli## cies , as this is good news for Europe . 
- Mr President , the ts## un## ami trage## dy should be no less significant to the world &apos;## s leader## s and to Europe th## an 11 Sept## ember . 
the Asian ts## un## ami should act as a turn## ing point for the most press## ing of the world &apos;## s priorit## ies - that of prevent## ing and combat## ing hung## er and dis## ease . 
I there## fore wish to ask four question## s . 
first## ly , do you believ## e that the EUR 4## 50 million announce## d for re## construct## ion might under## mine programme## s al## read## y planned for Asia ( as is the case of EUR 1## 50 million of the EUR 4## 50 million announce## d ) ? 
second## ly , do you intend to back the cancel## l## ation of the debt of countries affect## ed by the ts## un## ami or do you advoc## ate just a mora## torium ? 
t## hirdly , will the## y be treat## ed the same as Iraq , or wor## s## e th## an Iraq ? 
last## ly , Commission## er Michel propos## ed to the last Council a more ambitious target th## an 0.## 7 % for development . 
will you re## consider this propos## al , or will it be jettison## ed for good ? 
my dear Mr Ju## ncker , Luxembourg &apos;## s preside## ncies of the EU are usual## ly a## mong the best , per## hap## s be## cause a small country know## s that it can## not monopol## ise the age## nda but that it must be of service to every## one . 
I am s## ure that you will continu## e that tradition , and would also call upon you and the Council to treat support## ers and opponent## s of the Constitution exact## ly the same . 
our build## ing## s here are full of express## ions of commit## ment to a &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e : &apos; y## es &quot; sign## s , bad## ge## s and ball## oon## s , the## ir pre## s## ence decide## d upon - and paid for out of our common budget - be## fore Parliament ha## s vot## ed . 
it will not , how## ever , be until this afternoon that we know the result , and it is certain that there will be vot## es bo## th in favour of , and again## st , the Constitution . 
th## ose in favour can## not steal tax## payer## s &quot; contribut## ions to promot## e a definite view . 
refer## endum## s belong to us all , and vot## ers are entitle## d to balance## d inform## ation , not propag## anda paid for through tax## es . 
on Mon## day even## ing , Parliament &apos;## s Session## al Service## s decide## d to s## end some million## s of euro## s to the supranational EU part## ies , which are all in favour of the EU Constitution . 
more th## an 1## 50 Member## s of the European Parliament will not have a share of these resource## s . 
that is contr## ary to the principle of equal## ity and thu## s illegal . 
I would call upon you to ra## ise the matter in the Council s## o that the regulation re## l## ating to part## ies is either abolish## ed or supplement## ed by arrange## ments for th## ose who do not wish to belong to a supranational party but wish to engage in correspond## ing European inform## ation @## -## @ provid## ing activities , for ex## ample concern## ing the Constitution . 
how will you guarantee that EU resource## s us## ed by the campaign## ers for a &apos; y## es &quot; vot## e can be us## ed equal## ly well by the campaign## ers for a &apos; no &quot; vot## e ? 
may I final## ly call upon you to intimate that you will respect the out## come of the refer## endum## s , whet## her the## y be &apos; y## es &quot; or &apos; no . &quot; 
Mr President , lad## ies and gentle## men , there can be no doubt that the most ambitious task fac## ing the in## coming Luxembourg Presidency will be the conclusion of negoti## ations on the Fina## ncial Perspective for 20## 07 @## -## @ 20## 13 . 
this will un## question## ably be an extreme## ly cha## lleng## ing task , but I am in no doubt that every## thing in our power should be done to reach a compromis## e on the budget by Ju## ne of this year at the la## test . 
other## wise we will risk major delay## s , for ex## ample in the draw## ing up of regional aid programme## s , and this could mean EU fund## s not reach## ing the Member State## s in Janu## ary 20## 07 . 
it is of course not just the d## ate by which we reach a compromis## e that is of cruc## ial import## ance , but also the nature of the compromis## e . 
Mr Barros## o right## ly s## aid that we can## not have more Europe for less money . 
the European Union will cease to exist with## out solid## arity , and this is why we can## not consent to either the policy of solid## arity or the need to support the new Member State## s be## ing re## mov## ed from the EU &apos;## s budget priorit## ies . 
we must be aware that un## less gap## s in economic development with## in the enlarge## d EU are address## ed , it will be im## possible to achiev## e the go## al## s of the Lisbon strate## gy . 
we must there## fore ensu## re that fund## s are earmark## ed in the futur## e EU budget for cohes## ion policy , as this is in the interest## s of the whole Comm## un## ity . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , there can be no doubt that President Bush &apos;## s visit to Bru## ssels will be the most significant e## vent to occur d## uring the six @## -## @ month Luxembourg Presidency . 
it will be the first time that a President of the Unit## ed State## s ha## s ever visit## ed the European institution## s . 
I hope that this symbol## ic visit will go some way to im## prov## ing trans## atlantic relation## s , which have be## en some## what s## train## ed re## cent## ly . 
un## less we co## operate close## ly with the Unit## ed State## s , we will struggle to respond to a great man## y global challenge## s . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , I welcome## d your comment## s on relation## s with Ukraine . 
the European Union must draw it## s own conclusion## s from even## ts last year in one of it## s neighbour## ing countries . 
the Ukrainian people have prov## en that the## y share our European value## s , and that the## y desir## e integration with the EU . 
we should there## fore offer them a partner## ship that could ultimate## ly lead to member## ship . 
Mr President , as you know , the European institution## s re## cent## ly - and , I think , disastrous## ly - cut the Gord## ian knot with regard to the possible access## ion of a non @## -## @ European country , Tur## key , to the European Union . 
an issue of that kind threaten## s to change the ver## y nature of the Union as we know it and even put## s the futur## e of European co## operation as we know it fundamental## ly at risk . 
it is , above all , an issue in respect of which a large major## ity of our elector## ate , our citizen## s , are ver## y alien## ated from the position adopt## ed by the official European institution## s . 
I regret , th## en , the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s fail## ure to take the opportun## ity , first of all , of ask## ing respect for the democratic will of the major## ity of our citizen## s and , second## ly , as a small Member State , ask## ing respect for that other small Member State , Cyprus , which is be## ing ignor## ed and mis## judge## d by the Turk## ish leader## s in the most arrog## ant and un## accept## able mann## er . 
in my view , this is a mis## s## ed opportun## ity , and one that can on## ly widen the enormous chasm between our citizen## s on the one hand and European politic## s on the other . 
Mr Ju## ncker ha## s describ## ed a ver## y ambitious age## nda for these next six month## s ; this age## nda offer## s a great opportun## ity , but is also a great respons## ibility for Luxembourg and particular## ly for it## s Pr## ime Minister , who ha## s bo## th experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task . 
I would like to make a few comment## s on the great## est challenge for this Presidency , which , in my opinion , will be the reform of the financial perspective## s , which you , Mr Ju## ncker , mention## ed in pass## ing . 
it will prob## ably be the most essential element , on the bas## is of which these six month## s will be assess## ed . 
it is clear that success or fail## ure depend## s not on## ly upon the action## s of the Presidency , but it is the case that d## uring this time the Luxembourg Govern## ment will have to employ all it## s de## termination , and I am pleas## ed that you have stated this morning that you will ensu## re that the general interest is put first , be## cause , as you have s## aid your## self , to reach Ju## ly with## out an agree## ment would spell financial cha## os for the European Union . 
in order to be success## ful , the Presidency will have to seek compromis## es ; I believ## e that these compromis## es will have to be bas## ed on two fundamental## s : on the one hand , the valid## ity of the principle of cohes## ion , as stated by the Council at the end of the Swe## dish Presidency , and , on the other , balance in the distribut## ion of burden## s . 
I hope that over the next six month## s this House can learn the cost of enlarge## ment to the origin## al fifteen Member State## s , be## cause on the object## ive bas## is of figure## s it is possible to make propos## al## s that the European citizen## s in e## ach Member State can understand and accept . 
on the subject of the citizen## s , and going beyond what is laid down in the Treat## ies , I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intend## s the European Parliament , which is going to give it## s opinion in May , to play in this negoti## ation ? 
Mr President , Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , you re## cent## ly stated , Mr Ju## ncker , and in## de## ed you repeat## ed just now , that competitive## ness will be n## either the Ho## ly Gra## il nor the be all and end all as far as you are concern## ed , in particular with regard to the mid @## -## @ term review of the Lisbon strate## gy . 
you not## ed that social go## al## s and sustain## able development go## al## s should not be plac## ed in op## position to go## al## s re## l## ating to competitive## ness . 
my group welcome## s this statement , as we believ## e the opposite to be tru## e , name## ly that promot## ion of the European model is a major driv## ing force be## hind competitive## ness on our continent . 
in fact , we believ## e that what is need## ed is a Europe of excel## lence which attach## es priorit## y to invest## ment in research , innov## ation , employ## ee train## ing , the qual## ity of infra## structure## s , trans @## -## @ European network## s , public service## s , the qual## ity of work and social relation## s . 
we agree with you on this issue , and we some## time## s detect## ed a s## light differ## ence of approach to that adopt## ed by the President of the Commission . 
we hope that he will be equal## ly clear in hi## s statement## s , e## special## ly with regard to social issue## s . 
y## et the good intention## s you have profess## ed to hold will be put to a number of test## s . 
I should like to mention three s## uch test## s , the first of which is the European budget . 
we share your view that this debate must not be allow## ed to get bog## ged down and that it must progress rapid## ly . 
you intend to act as a motiv## ating and inter## medi## ary force , as well as one that accele## rates the process , but we do not want the process of reach## ing a compromis## e on the Fina## ncial Perspective## s to be accele## rated if this would mean sacr## ific## ing a budget that meet## s the European Union &apos;## s need## s . 
we agree with Mr Barros## o on this issue ; we need a budget that en## able## s us to guarantee cohes## ion , solid## arity , invest## ment in the futur## e and in research and invest## ment in the trans @## -## @ European network## s . 
the process should not be accele## rated at the expense of the final out## come . 
the second test will be the direct## ive on service## s of general interest , which ha## s al## read## y be## en mention## ed today by a number of speaker## s , in particular Mr Tur## mes . 
I believ## e that you your## self are aware of a risk that is a cause of great concern to us , name## ly the extend## ed s## cope of this direct## ive , which pose## s a threat to a large number of service## s of general interest . 
we are also concern## ed by the country of origin principle , which pose## s a threat to the right to work in multi## ple countries ; I am think## ing in particular of the application of collect## ive bargain## ing agree## ments . 
the thir## d test relate## s more general## ly to the European social age## nda . 
we would particular## ly like to see a clear commit## ment on your part in relation to other Council member## s regard## ing a review of the Direct## ive on Work## ing Time and a remo## val of the opt @## -## @ out clause , and , final## ly , regard## ing a propos## ed review of the Direct## ive on European Work## s Council## s . 
Mr President , on 1 Janu## ary , Luxembourg beg## an it## s elev## en## th EU preside## ncy . 
the experience it ha## s gain## ed in this field , and the excel## lent prepar## ations that have be## en ma## de and which I have seen for my## self , will be a great help in deal## ing with the vari## ous challenge## s that await you , start## ing with the terr## ible disaster in Asia . 
the latter show## ed that there is an ur## gent need for human## itarian aid to be co## ordinate## d on the ground , and should encourag## e us to set up the European Volunt## ary Human## itarian Aid Corp## s , as provid## ed for by the Constitution , as s## oon as possible . 
there are other issue## s that you will have to deal with , of which I s## hall on## ly mention three . 
first## ly , the Lisbon process ha## s reach## ed it## s half## way point . 
this process need## s to be ma## de clear## er and it need## s target## ed priorit## ies ; in short , it will need to be ma## de easi## er to understand . 
I am there## fore fully in favour of the three aim## s you ident## ified . 
the second issue will be the Fina## ncial Perspective . 
it is doubt## less to be welcome## d that it will be the Luxembourg Presidency that put## s the finish## ing touch## es to it , but man## y people are s## till un## decide## d between 1 % and 1.2## 4 % , to say nothing of 1.1## 4 % - and I could go on - and much money is also hang## ing in the balance . 
final## ly , the St## ability Pact will need to be amend## ed , and the necess## ary balance found between strict## ness and flexibil## ity to ensu## re that st## ability is not compromis## ed . 
Mr President , I ver## y much hope that your success will be equal to the ef## fort## s that have be## en ma## de by s## o man## y people . 
Mr President , I would like to wish Pr## ime Minister Ju## ncker a posit## ive and productive preside## ncy and am ver## y pleas## ed to see a small , success## ful , in## dependent country lead## ing the European Union . 
Luxembourg is one of the six Member State## s that is small## er th## an my own country , Wal## es , and an ex## ample of what an in## dependent Wal## es could achiev## e . 
the priorit## ies paper tries to maintain the essential balance between economic , social and environment## al poli## cies . 
I would like to mention the continu## ing campaign again## st discrimin## ation , in the hope that real progress will be ma## de on the European Gen## der Institut## e and on the re## cast equal## ity direct## ive . 
there is no better ex## ample of the fail## ure of poli## cies on equal## ity th## an the pay gap between men and women . 
thir## ty year## s after legisl## ation was pass## ed on this issue , a report publish## ed this week by the GM## B trade union in the UK show## s that , in Ang## les## ey in my constitue## ncy , full @## -## @ time pay for women is as low as 59 % of that for men . 
this is a scandal which must be address## ed and I hope equal## ity issue## s will be give## n priorit## y . 
Mr President , first of all , I should like to express my condolence## s to Mr Ju## ncker on account of the death of Grand Du## ches## s Jose## ph## ine @## -## @ Char## lotte . 
I wish you and the Luxembourg people strength to bear this los## s , and may God be close to you . 
the Luxembourg Presidency is fac## ing the weight## y task of reform## ing the St## ability Pact and implement## ing the conclusion## s of W## im Kok &apos;## s report . 
the Commission &apos;## s propos## al to give due consider## ation to the economic climate in the St## ability Pact offer## s , in my view , a bas## is for carry## ing out adequate reform## s . 
the implement## ation of the Pact benefit## s from clear decision @## -## @ making . 
clear sanction## s are s## till need## ed . 
it was in the aut## um## n of 20## 04 that Mr Kok present## ed hi## s report on the Lisbon strate## gy ; hi## s conclusion is as clear as it is predict## able : the Member State## s must re## ally get down to carry## ing out structural reform## s . 
I would there## fore like to ask Mr Ju## ncker in what way we can expect your preside## ncy to follow that up . 
since Luxembourg ha## s al## ways be## en a great champion of necess## ary reform## s , I have high hope## s . 
final## ly , with regard to the Member## s &quot; statute , can Parliament expect from the preside## ncy that a decision will final## ly be ma## de on this subject in the next six month## s ? 
thank you , Mr President . 
I wish the Luxembourg preside## ncy every success . it will be in the interest## s of us all . 
you are the second country to hold the preside## ncy of the enlarge## d twen## ty @## -## @ f## ive . 
you are a found## ing state of the European Union and you are also an ex## ample of how a small country can set the tempo and dictat## e the conditio## ns to the big countries . 
the President of the European Commission , Mr Barros## o , drew attention in hi## s speech today to the increas## ed financial pressure on the new Member State## s , refer## ring to the back## ward region## s . 
I should like to point out that these ten Member State## s also have great wealth . 
man## y of these region## s have be## en depriv## ed of ten## s and hundred## s of young ambitious people , s## cient## ists , doctor## s , who have left in the last fifteen year## s for the old Europe and the## y are contribut## ing to the## ir success## ful econom## ies . 
I should like to point out to the Luxembourg preside## ncy that we do not wish to be just the recipient## s of char## ity . 
I see this as an opportun## ity for you active## ly to involve the new ten . 
follow## ing rat## ification of the Constitution## al Treat## y , Europe will build new institution## s . 
I invit## e you to take step## s to ensu## re that the east of the European Union is give## n the right to host an import## ant European institution . 
I am convince## d that this idea could be a success . 
evidence of this faith is the fact that the Bush - Pu## tin meet## ing is to take place in my li## ttle country , Slovak## ia . 
- Mr President , the reform of the St## ability Pact and the reform of the financial perspective are two side## s of the same coin . 
these reform## s need to find a common philosoph## y and a common solution : more grow## th , more competitive## ness and more resource## s for the Member State## s . 
that all mean## s more af## flu## ence and more cohes## ion . 
let me be frank with you , Mr Ju## ncker . 
what you have s## aid on the St## ability and G## row## th Pact is thorough## ly accept## able , but it is all provid## ed for in the current system of regulation : the auto## matic stabilis## ing mechan## ism## s , the## ir relation## ship with grow## th or re## cession , the relation## ship between great## er de## ficit flexibil## ity and the effective## ness of debt dynamic## s - all that is al## read## y provid## ed for . 
what the European Union need## s now is not that , but per## hap## s we should be more ambitious . 
I say more ambitious , but that does not mean less rigor## ous , just more mind## ful of the strategic need## s of our Union . 
if we re## ally have to re @## -## @ establish an effective , Europe @## -## @ wide strate## gy for invest## ments , infra## structure , research and securit## y - in short , to meet the target## s set at the Lisbon Summit - th## en we have to reach agree## ment on the kind## s of action need## ed : no hypo## cris## y , no dirt## y trick## s and no opportun## ism . 
the Pact need## s a European gold## en rule , as one might say , with the appropriate guarantee## s and control## s attach## ed . 
the financial perspective need## s a strong## er , not a weak## er Union budget , one that focus## es more on the invest## ments require## d by the Lisbon object## ive## s and less on hand## out## s . 
Mr Ju## ncker , Mr Barros## o , will we be cap## able of that ? 
it depend## s on us . 
the respons## ibility rest## s with us all , but pleas## e let us not have any hypo## cris## y . 
Mr Ju## ncker , I would like to focus my brief comment## s on the financial perspective## s , which , of the challenge## s that have be## en mention## ed today , are per## hap## s the most difficult fac## ing this Presidency . 
in explain## ing your priorit## ies , you say that you accept the reason## s why it is necess## ary to reach a political agree## ment on the financial perspective## s in Ju## ne , s## o that the legisl## ative procedure## s can be conclude## d under the Brit## ish Presidency , reconcil## ing national differ## ence## s . 
we wish you luck , be## cause , on the one hand , there is the enlarge## ment we have just car## ried out , with ten new Member State## s who## s## e economic situ## ation mean that we are going to have to make an enormous financial ef## fort with a view to social and economic cohes## ion , in order to protect the European social model , as you have stress## ed in your speech . 
on the other hand , there are the short @## -## @ sighted account## ants , who## s## e s## ole aim is not to exceed a certain level of spend## ing . 
we hope that , with your experience and with the co## operation of the European Parliament , your Presidency will persuade the Council to take a broad## er view , and make it see that it is ir## respons## ible to try to creat## e more Europe with less resource## s - to use o## nce again that well @## -## @ worn phrase . 
but it is also necess## ary to make the Council see that budget## ary policy , Mr Ju## ncker , is fac## ing much more import## ant challenge## s th## an keeping spend## ing be## low a particular per## cent## age of gross domestic product . 
let us continu## e to build a Europe a## mong## st all of us and with sufficient resource## s , as laid down in the Treat## ies , s## o that we do not disappoint the citizen## s . 
Mr President , the new preside## ncy can be assure## d that hundred## s and thousand## s of Brit## ish citizen## s will fight the propos## ed European Constitution tooth and nail , and million## s of us will vot## e again## st it when the time come## s ! 
we have no quarrel with the people of Europe : our quarrel is on## ly with the system of unit## ary govern## ment call## ed the European Union . 
the EU is the of the account## able parliament## ary demo## cracy that the Brit## ish invent## ed over 700 year## s ago . 
this attempt## ed revers## al of the relation## ship between the State and the individual ha## s be## en foist## ed on us over the last 30 year## s by deceit , deni## al and misrepresent## ation . 
but now we understand fully what the EU is re## ally all about . 
we may not leave d## uring your preside## ncy , but be in no doubt - leave we s## hall ! 
Mr President , the ten## or of my speech will be ra## ther different from that of the pre## vi## ous speaker &apos;## s . 
let me start by thank## ing the Luxembourg Presidency , not on## ly for the excel## lent age## nda it ha## s present## ed , but also for the style , content and level of commit## ment evident in it . 
in the coming month## s , the Luxembourg Presidency will certain## ly have it## s work cut out , and we have high hope## s . 
there are great challenge## s that require an answer and that Europe ha## s to meet . 
I should like to bring up one of th## ose challenge## s , name## ly more and better job## s , but also sustain## ability and social cohes## ion . 
I will there## fore repeat to Mr Goebbel## s and Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit that the Socialist## s and the Green## s do not have s## ole exhibit## ion right## s in this respect . 
social cohes## ion is ver## y much one of the Christ## ian Democrat## s &quot; principle## s , and I will al## ways continu## e to dedicate my## self , as I know will our group , to ensu## re that social cohes## ion is maintain## ed . 
that is why I am pleas## ed that not on## ly the President of the Council , but also the President of the Commission and the chair## man of my group mention## ed it . 
I should like to say a few word## s about Lisbon , and I want to make a number of point## s . 
first of all , while the object## ive of what we di## d in Lisbon was sound , and the result we would like to achiev## e is excel## lent , we forgo## t that , when all th## ose Head## s of Govern## ment w## ent home , no## body assume## d any respons## ibility or li## ability for this process . 
what matter## s more th## an any## thing else at the moment is , in add## ition to all the new measure## s that have to be take## n , for people to be ma## de account## able . 
it will th## en be possible to ver## ify national plan## s at European level . 
I should like to finish off with a cry from the heart . 
I have notice## d that we have ma## de a few agree## ments about the free market that we## re sub## sequent## ly flout## ed by the Member State## s and also by the European Commission , as regard## s qual## ification## s , mobil## ity , and s## o on . 
Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy is s## o full of grand idea## s that we often hear ver## y li## ttle - and in## de## ed we have heard ver## y li## ttle today - about the simpl## e thing## s , s## uch as im## prov## ing the qual## ity of our own legisl## ation . 
the fact is that the European Union could add between two and six per cent to it## s product## ivity if it## s regulator## y frame## work was match## ed by the best in the world . 
we should there## fore be making it a priorit## y of the Luxembourg preside## ncy to encourag## e the Commission to put real resource## s in## to consult## ations at an ear## ly s## tage in it## s propos## al## s and to test whet## her it## s competitive## ness is appropriate . 
we also need to spend time look## ing at exist## ing legisl## ation and see## ing whet## her it ha## s achiev## ed the effect that we ask## ed for . 
often we pass legisl## ation , but do not look at what it ha## s actual## ly achiev## ed . 
is exist## ing legisl## ation be## ing proper## ly enforce## d and implement## ed ? 
it seem## s to me that , in the European Union of 25 , implement## ation enforce## ment should get far high## er priorit## y th## an it ha## s up until now . 
I am glad that the Committee on the Inter## nal Market and Consumer Protect## ion ha## s take## n up my suggest## ion that we should have an own @## -## @ initiative report look## ing precise## ly at these issue## s . 
we have also heard consider## able talk today about social Europe , but we have to ensu## re that social Europe appli## es to every## body and not simpl## y to th## ose who are in work . 
far too man## y of our citizen## s are economic## ally in## active , and there## fore we should be put## ting invest## ment in## to active labour market poli## cies that en## able people to get back to work and th## en poli## cies that support people in order for them to be able to continu## e in work . 
if we fail to do that , th## en we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy . 
final## ly , I urge the Luxembourg preside## ncy to take fresh initiative## s in relation to North## ern Cyprus s## o that we can ensu## re we have effective economic re## generation in that part of the country . 
Mr President , I should like to begin by wish## ing Mr Ju## ncker and hi## s country a success## ful preside## ncy . 
Mr President @## -## @ in @## -## @ Office , you assume the leader## ship of the Union at a cruc## ial period . 
the rat## ification process for the Constitution is under## way , the Lisbon process is not y## et making en## ough progress and the futur## e of trans## atlantic relation## s is a source of concern . 
in Mar## ch , the European Council will conduct the mid @## -## @ term review of the Lisbon process . 
it will do it again## st the back## drop of the Kok report , which was blunt in it## s assess## ment of the lack of progress . 
I urge the preside## ncy not to be distract## ed by the siren call## s of th## ose who urge that the pre## serv## ation of the &apos; European model &apos; is the most import## ant political priorit## y . 
it is clear## ly not . it is precise## ly be## cause s## o man## y govern## ments have fail## ed to grasp the ne## ttle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in s## uch di## re s## trait## s . 
the Unit## ed State## s continu## es to out @## -## @ perform us and the competitive challenge## s from Asia , particular## ly Chi## na and In## dia , are increas## ing , with no ap## parent ur## gent respons## e from national capital## s in our Union . 
the preside## ncy must be un## equi## vocal in it## s support for economic reform , for great## er labour market flexibil## ity , for more competitive tax## ation poli## cies , and for re## duc## ing bar## rier## s to employ## ment grow## th , particular## ly the excess## ive regulation that pervade## s all our econom## ies . 
with high un## employ## ment a factor a## cross Europe , people are wait## ing for practical ways of get## ting them back to work . 
reform will be difficult and fraught with risk , but as the Unit## ed K## ing## dom , under Margaret That## cher in the 19## 80## s and Spa## in under Mr Azna## r in the 19## 90## s prov## ed , a resolute approach to economic reform deliver## s result## s . 
low tax## ation , flex## ible labour market## s , less red tape and a de## termination to tip the balance firm## ly in favour of the wealth @## -## @ creat## ors offer## s the on## ly way out of a relativ## e economic decline . 
these thing## s are natural## ly anathema to social## ists but are good for all our citizen## s . 
we look to the spring Council in Mar## ch to re## verse the fail## ures of re## cent time## s and put Europe firm## ly on a free market and enter## prise @## -## @ d## riven path . 
Mr President , the whole issue of child## ren ha## s be## en in## visible in EU poli## cies and programme## s . 
how## ever , child## ren &apos;## s right## s are now mention## ed in the Constitution and the Char## ter of Fund## a## mental Right## s . 
it is import## ant that progress is ma## de to## ward## s a horizontal European policy on child## ren . 
child## ren can## not defend them## selves . thu## s it is our oblig## ation to do this . 
every day we hear about child## ren who are starv## ing , dy## ing or abuse## d in all possible ways . 
how## ever , there is no mention in your programme of a full @## -## @ scale strate## gy on child## ren &apos;## s right## s in accord## ance with the UN Convent## ion on Child## ren &apos;## s Right## s , which was ratifi## ed by most European countries . 
child## ren are vulner## able to traffick## ing . 
the re## cent## ly publish## ed report on traffick## ing in human be## ing## s by the Expert## s Group ha## s a strong human right## s dimension . 
I urge the Luxembourg preside## ncy to take this forward , including a specific legal instrument to promot## e and protect the right## s of child## ren who have be## en traffick## ed . 
the Luxembourg preside## ncy ha## s stated that a direct## ive on the return of asy## lum seeker## s is a priorit## y . 
it is import## ant that there is a specific section to protect the right## s of child## ren and that un## accompani## ed child## ren are not return## ed to the## ir countries of origin with## out an assess## ment of what is in the## ir best interest## s . 
the mainstream## ing of child## ren &apos;## s right## s in European Union development policy ha## s not be## en achiev## ed . 
I urge the Luxembourg preside## ncy to address this fail## ure with## out delay by call## ing for a communic## ation on child## ren &apos;## s right## s and new development co## operation and by support## ing reference## s to child## ren &apos;## s right## s as a priorit## y . 
I further urge it to revise the development policy statement . 
the implement## ation of new guide## line## s to safeguard child## ren in conflict area## s remain## s a concern . 
in order to ensu## re progress , it is essential that the Luxembourg preside## ncy take## s this process forward by comp## let## ing and put## ting in## to practice a plan of action . 
in conclusion , it is vital that child## ren &apos;## s right## s are ma## de a priorit## y of the Luxembourg preside## ncy and that child## ren &apos;## s right## s are include## d in the preside## ncy conclusion## s . 
Mr President , I have notice## d two short## coming## s in the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s programme , and I should like to ask two question## s with regard to these short## coming## s . 
the document out## lining the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s priorit## ies mention## s 27 countries and region## s out## side the EU by name , y## et East## ern Europe and Ukraine are not mention## ed o## nce . 
to put it an## other way , the programme lack## s an eastern dimension . 
it would be some## what alarm## ing if this reflect## ed the Luxembourg Presidency &apos;## s view## s and intention## s with regard to the new European demo## cracy that ha## s emerge## d be## fore our ver## y eye## s and on our ver## y door## step . 
the comment## s ma## de be## fore this House on Ukraine have be## en ver## y cautious . 
the## y do not imp## ly that measure## s will be take## n that are equal to the respons## ibility which Europe bear## s to## ward## s Ukraine , and which pose## s a moral and political imperative . 
if we we## re to content our## selves with the old A## ction Plan , which was bas## ed on the neighbour## hood policy , we would be do## ing far too li## ttle , and we would be making a mistake . 
this plan was drawn up for a Ukraine from a different age , be## fore the &apos; O## range R## evolution &quot; took place , offer## ing hope and a model for peace## ful political transform## ation . 
the even## ts in Ukraine merit a re## action from Europe , not mer## e## ly word## s and out## d## ated instrument## s . 
time pass## es more rapid## ly , and in## de## ed different## ly , in C## ent## ral and East## ern Europe . 
we must act now to ensu## re that demo## cracy is not mer## e## ly victor## ious , but that it is long @## -## @ last## ing and a source of hope to other## s . 
what should there## fore be done ? 
the old A## ction Plan should be revise## d and extend## ed beyond the neighbour## hood policy , and a fresh offer should be ma## de . 
the EU &apos;## s relation## s with Ukraine should be advance## d to a new level , and the country should be offer## ed an Associ## ation Agreement and the prospect of member## ship . 
we should not thwart Ukraine &apos;## s European hope## s or trade in our fundamental value## s , s## uch as free## dom , demo## cracy and solid## arity , for oil and gas . 
by support## ing Ukrainian demo## cracy we will also support the democratic ambit## ions of the citizen## s of Belarus , Russia and the other countries of the post @## -## @ Soviet space . 
it is an opportun## ity for political change that will benefit the European Union in every respect . 
the er## a of Yalta , of the Bre## zhnev Doc## t## rine and of the Berlin Wall ha## s end## ed . 
we need a courage## ous policy bas## ed on our value## s , not on our financial interest## s , and promot## ing demo## cracy , human right## s and the right of nation## s to self @## -## @ de## termination . 
the for## ging of more open relation## s with a democratic Ukraine is bo## th a great challenge and a great respons## ibility for the Luxembourg Presidency . 
I wish it every success . 
. Mr President , I can take one of two approach## es ; I can either answer the 30 Member## s who have spoken , and risk be## ing ver## y long @## -## @ wind## ed , or I can mer## e## ly answer a few of them , and risk appear## ing extreme## ly im## polite to the other## s . 
I s## hall there## fore try to be brief in order to be polite . 
Mr Goebbel## s , who ha## s be## en follow## ing my progress close## ly for man## y year## s , believ## es me to be entire## ly in## cap## able of s## uch a thing , and on this point we agree . 
Mr President , sever## al speaker## s have refer## red to the Lisbon age## nda , in particular the group chair## men and other Member## s s## uch as Mr Swoboda and Mr## s O## omen . 
it would appear that we are more or less in agree## ment on the need to maintain the fundamental synerg## y on which the Lisbon strate## gy is bas## ed , and which was give## n a use## ful boost by the conclusion## s of the Gothenburg European Council . 
it ha## s become a habit of Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit &apos;## s to refer in## discrimin## ate## ly to author## s from bo## th side## s of the Rhine , and today he quote## d Victor Hug## o . 
with regard to the Lisbon age## nda , I should like to quote Pa## s## cal , who s## aid that he like## d thing## s that go hand in hand . 
this hold## s tru## e for a number of area## s of life , and it also hold## s tru## e for the Lisbon strate## gy . 
it is im## possible to distinguish between the vari## ous element## s that go to## ward## s making the Lisbon strate## gy s## o effective - and I am talk## ing here of it## s theoretical effective## ness , not the enthusiasm with which it is implement## ed . 
a number of you have refer## red to the much @## -## @ need## ed structural reform## s that must be car## ried out in the frame## work of the Lisbon strate## gy . 
I have be## en a member of the Eco## fin Council since 19## 89 , I believ## e . 
since th## en , I have be## en told week after week and month after month that structural reform## s must be car## ried out , y## et it is rare for me to come a## cross any## one who is able to say exact## ly what these structural reform## s should look like . 
as a general rule , it is my impress## ion that th## ose who say that structural reform## s must be car## ried out actual## ly mean that the social state must be dismantle## d . 
this is why it is frequent## ly s## aid with regard to structural reform## s that labour market## s must be reform## ed and that the## y need to be more flex## ible . 
I believ## e this to be tru## e , but I also believ## e that European employ## ers could be more flex## ible . 
I believ## e that it would be in the interest## s of decision @## -## @ maker## s , who frequent## ly also take decision## s for other## s , to prove them## selves more flex## ible in adapt## ing the tool## s we have to modern need## s . 
I my## self do not believ## e that European## s should be led to think that it will be en## ough to reform labour market## s , to abolish exist## ing social legisl## ation and to eliminate the buf## fer zone## s provid## ed by workers &quot; right## s in order to become more competitive . 
this would be a ver## y short @## -## @ term approach , with obvi## ous con## sequenc## es ; we would not gain competitive## ness , but we would lose the support of a large number of European## s , in particular workers . 
I should there## fore like to warn you again## st s## uch simpl## istic propos## al## s , which will get us no## where . 
sever## al of you stated that your group## s would support the St## ability Pact , and this ma## de the debate extreme## ly interest## ing . 
I s## hall explain what I mean by this . 
Mr Goebbel## s , no less , offer## ed the support of hi## s parliament## ary group , the Socialist## s . 
if I under## stood him correct## ly , Mr Co## hn @## -## @ Ben## dit appear## s to be mov## ing to## ward## s a clear meet## ing of interest## s and idea## s on this issue . 
Mr Po## ette## ring promise## d the support of the Group of the European People &apos;## s Part## y . 
f## ive minute## s of the Luxembourg Presidency we## re there## fore all that we## re need## ed to see the Socialist## s , the Liberal## s , the Christ## ian Democrat## s and all the other## s agree on the general shape to be take## n by the reform of the St## ability and G## row## th Pact . 
this is some## thing I welcome great## ly , and in this respect the Luxembourg Presidency will be straight## forward ; this was not some## thing I was aware of be## fore today &apos;## s s## itt## ing . 
I s## hall turn brief## ly to the Direct## ive on the liberal## isation of service## s , with regard to which I thought I had ma## de my view## s clear . 
we will not reject this Direct## ive , as it could in fact generate job## s if we draft it in a way that is appropriate to the situ## ation . 
I would like us , how## ever , to join force## s to re## move every## thing from this Direct## ive which pose## s a risk of social dump## ing , and which ha## s crep## t in## to the text if one read## s between the line## s . 
I am well aware that our discuss## ion of this direct## ive is be## devilled by con## fusion , be## cause the potent## ial risk## s posed by a number of it## s provision## s are not obvi## ous . 
I should there## fore like to call on the Commission , the Council and Parliament to examin## e this draft direct## ive line by line , search## ing for any risk of social dump## ing . 
after all , give## n that every## one , including Mr Bolk## e## stein , tell## s me that the aim is not to violate the rule## s which protect our labour market## s , we should be able to eliminate the risk of social dump## ing - a risk I believ## e to be ver## y much present as far as this direct## ive is concern## ed - by mean## s of a common read## ing , if this is in## de## ed our over## all intention .
